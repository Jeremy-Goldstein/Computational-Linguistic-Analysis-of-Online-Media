# Text-Analysis-Online-Media

This project is an analysis of news media using Python's industry-standard natural language programming libraries, including NLTK, Textacy, Scikit-Learn, MALLET, and others. By leveraging NLP paradigms, this project demonstrates the value of core computational linguistic concepts: scraping datasets from the web; processing text as part of text sanitization; and examining corpora quantitatively through TF-IDF, PCA, LDA, etc.
