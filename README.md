# Computational Linguistic Analysis of Online Media

This [project](https://jeremy-goldstein.github.io/Computational-Linguistic-Analysis-of-Online-Media/) is an analysis of news media using Python's industry-standard natural language programming libraries, including NLTK, Textacy, Scikit-Learn, MALLET, and others. By leveraging NLP paradigms, this project demonstrates the value of core computational linguistic concepts: scraping datasets from the web; pre-processing text as part of text sanitization; and examining corpora quantitatively through TF-IDF, PCA, LDA and other methods.
