Former First Lady Barbara Bush, who has been battling congestive heart failure, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment and go home from a hospital to be "surrounded by a family she adores," according to a statement released Sunday by the office of former President George H.W. Bush.

Mrs. Bush, 92, has been hospitalized several times in Houston, Texas, over the past year to be treated for chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure, her family has said.

“Following a recent series of hospitalizations, and after consulting her family and doctors, Mrs. Bush, now age 92, has decided not to seek additional medical treatment, and instead will focus on comfort care,” read a statement released by her husband's office.

"It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself -- thanks to her abiding faith, but for others," the statement reads. "She is surrounded by a family she adores and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving."

In January, Mrs. Bush and her husband were hospitalized at the same time. She was being treated by bronchitis and the nation's 41st president was being treated for pneumonia.

Barbara Bush served as the country's first lady from 1989 to 1993. She is the mother of George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States.Excerpts from former FBI Director James Comey’s upcoming memoir, and from an interview Comey gave to ABC News, set off a Sunday-morning tweetstorm of accusations, corrections and annotations from President Trump, including the bizarre assertion that “I hardly even knew this guy.”

In the Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty,” set to be published Tuesday, the former FBI director details numerous meetings, include some one-on-one with Trump, during which Comey claims the president was seeking his loyalty.

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018





In testimony to Congress after his firing last year, Comey said he made contemporaneous memos about his conversations with Trump and described them to other top FBI officials.

In the book, Comey tries to explain his rationale for his controversial announcement, just before the election, that the FBI had reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state.

Comey told ABC he assumed Clinton would win and didn’t want her legitimacy tainted if the investigation came out after the election.

“Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe,” Trump tweeted Sunday. “In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!”

But Comey’s decision to reopen the investigation on the eve of the election is what some Clinton supporters, and the candidate herself, believe cost her the presidency. Trump’s interpretation — that Comey was angling for a job in a Clinton administration — seems to make no sense.

Trump also revived criticism of a meeting former President Bill Clinton had with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch in June 2016, while the FBI’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails was underway.

“Comey throws AG Lynch ‘under the bus!’” Trump tweeted. “Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!”

Trump also weighed in on what he described as “big questions” left unanswered by Comey’s memoir — and suggested Comey ought to be prosecuted.

The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018





Comey has never been formally accused of lying to Congress or leaking classified information. He admitted leaking his contemporaneous memos to a New York Times reporter, though they were not thought to have contained any classified material.

The president punctuated his Twitter rant with a new disparaging nickname for his former FBI director.

“Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” the president tweeted.

Comey, who has not responded publicly to Trump’s Twitter barbs, tweeted a vague statement promoting his memoir early Sunday afternoon.FILE - This April 11, 2018 file photo shows attorney Michael Cohen in New York.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that all lawyers are now "deflated and concerned" by the FBI raid on his personal attorney Michael Cohen, who is under criminal investigation for personal business dealings.

"Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past," he tweeted. "I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!"

The raid carried out last Monday at Cohen's apartment, hotel room, office and safety deposit box sought bank records, records on Cohen's dealing in the taxi industry, Cohen's communications with the Trump campaign and information on payments he made in 2016 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal and to porn actress Stormy Daniels, people familiar with the investigation into Cohen told The Associated Press.

Trump has been enraged by the raid, calling it an "attack on the country."

Lawyers for Cohen appeared in federal court in New York on Friday asking that they, not the Department of Justice, be given a first crack at reviewing the seized evidence to see if it was relevant to the investigation or could be forwarded to criminal investigators without jeopardizing attorney-client privilege.

In a court filing Friday, federal prosecutors said the criminal investigation had been going on for months and agents had already searched multiple email accounts maintained by Cohen under an earlier search warrant.

Prosecutors contend that Cohen was "performing little to no legal work" for Trump. They acknowledged that the investigation was referred by special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but was being conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders demurred when asked Sunday on ABC's "This Week" if Trump was worried that Cohen might agree to work with prosecutors, if charged, to reduce his own punishment.

"Look, the president is very confident in the fact that he has done nothing wrong and he can't speak on behalf of anyone else, but he's very confident in what he has and hasn't done," Sanders said. "And he's going to continue focusing and fighting for the American people."

Cohen, who didn't attend Friday's hearing, was ordered to appear in federal court on Monday to help answer questions about his law practice. He has denied wrongdoing.

Both McDougal and Daniels say they had affairs with a married Trump, which the president has denied.

Daniels' attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Sunday that his client will attend Monday's hearing. In a tweet, he also responded to Trump's comment about how "all lawyers" are feeling after the Cohen raid.

"To be clear - I am not "deflated and concerned". I am "elated and hopeful,"" Avenatti wrote. "The events of the last week reinstill the belief that NOBODY is above the law and the attorney-client privilege cannot be used by those in power to hide criminal conduct."FILE - In this March 23, 2018, file photo, French President Emmanuel Macron, right, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel speak at a news conference in Brussels.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The future of the landmark Iran nuclear deal hangs in the balance and its survival may depend on the unlikely success of last-minute European interventions with President Donald Trump.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are to visit Washington separately later this month and, barring a sudden trip by British Prime Minister Theresa May, will likely be the last foreign leaders invested in the deal to see Trump ahead of his mid-May deadline for the accord to be strengthened. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the 2015 agreement by May 12 unless U.S., British, French and German negotiators can agree to fix what he sees as its serious flaws.

Iran has said U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions would destroy the agreement and has threatened a range of responses, including immediately restarting nuclear activities currently barred under the deal.

Negotiators met for a fourth time last week and made some progress but were unable to reach agreement on all points, according to U.S. officials and outside advisers to the Trump administration familiar with the status of the talks. That potentially leaves the Iran deal's fate to Macron, who will make a state visit to Washington on April 24, and Merkel, who pays a working visit to the U.S. capital on April 27, these people said.

"It's important to them and I know they'll raise their hopes and concerns when they travel here to the United States in the coming days," Mike Pompeo, the CIA chief and secretary of state-designate, told lawmakers on Thursday.

Pompeo's testimony at his Senate confirmation hearing came a day after the negotiators met at the State Department to go over the four issues that Trump says must be addressed if he is to once again renew sanctions relief for Iran, officials said.

Those are: Iran's ballistic missile testing and destabilizing behavior in the region, which are not covered by the deal, along with inspections of suspected nuclear sites and so-called "sunset provisions" that gradually allow Iran to resume advanced nuclear work after several years, which are part of the agreement.

Two senior U.S. officials said the sides are "close to agreement" on missiles and inspections but "not there yet" on the sunset provisions.

"Malign" Iranian activities, including its support for Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, Syrian President Bashar Assad and Houthi Shiite rebels in Yemen, were dealt with in a separate session that ended inconclusively, according to the officials, who like the outside advisers were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The two officials and two outside advisers said the missile and inspections issues are essentially settled, but would not detail exactly what had been agreed or predict whether it would pass muster with Trump, let alone his new national security adviser John Bolton and Pompeo. Both men are Iran hawks and share the president's disdain for the deal, which was a signature foreign policy achievement of former President Barack Obama.

Bolton and Pompeo's voices on Iran could be heard as senior U.S. officials discussed Trump's decision to launch airstrikes against Syria on Friday. In addition to punishing Syria for its apparent use of chemical weapons, the strikes were meant to send a message to Iran about its role in the country, the officials told reporters on Saturday.

The officials and advisers said the main sticking point on the Iran deal remains the sunset provisions, with the Europeans balking at U.S. demands for the automatic re-imposition of sanctions should Iran engage in advanced nuclear activity that would be permitted by the agreement once the restrictions expire.

To clear the impasse, one official and one outside adviser said a compromise is being considered under which sanctions would be re-imposed if Iran did enough work to reduce the time it would need to develop a nuclear weapon to less than a year. The current deal aims to keep Iran's so-called "breakout time" to a year. But the expiration of the sunset provisions, the first of which is in 2024, means that the breakout time could eventually drop.

The Europeans, who along with the Iranians, have said they will not re-open the deal for negotiation, are reluctant to automatically re-impose sanctions for permitted activity, but have agreed in principle that Iran dropping below a one-year breakout time should be cause to at least consider new sanctions, according to the official and the adviser. How that breakout time is determined is still being discussed, they said.

Given the remaining differences, U.S. national security officials are stepping up planning for various "day after" scenarios, including how to sell a pullout as the correct step for national security, how aggressively to reimpose U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the agreement and how to deal with Iranian and European fallout from such a step.Russian President Vladimir Putin listens during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, April 14, 2018.

MOSCOW (AP) — Facing a stark choice between engaging the United States, Britain and France in combat or passively watching them strike his ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin has opted for the peaceful route.

That cautious response may dent the Russian leader's tough-man image but it won't undermine his gains in Syria or erode his authority at home.

The Kremlin had warned Washington that Russia would fend off any strike that jeopardized its servicemen in Syria. The West respected that red line by giving advance notice of Saturday's attack, just as it did a year ago when it struck a Syrian air base. Russia had sat idle back then, but this time, it had threatened to retaliate.

Such a clash could have quickly spun out of control — an extremely dangerous scenario that was widely compared to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world narrowly escaped a nuclear conflict.

"With our allies, we ensured that the Russians were warned ahead of time," said French Defense Minister Florence Parly. The U.S.-led airstrikes were a response to a purported chemical attack on civilians in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7. Russia said its experts found no trace of chemical agents.

A senior French official noted that President Emmanuel Macron did not tell Putin about the strikes when they spoke on the phone Friday, but "certain de-confliction mechanisms" had already been triggered by that point and "both knew that a new phase was going to begin quickly."

Putin condemned Saturday's strikes as an "act of aggression" that will worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and have a "destructive influence on the entire system of international relations." He criticized Washington and its allies for attacking without waiting for inspectors from the international chemical weapons watchdog group to visit Douma, just outside Damascus.

The Russian military said its air defenses at two bases in Syria tracked the incoming missiles but didn't engage them.

Russian social media buzzed Saturday with angry nationalist comments blasting Putin for failing to protect his ally. But state TV focused on criticizing the West for acting on the basis of what Moscow called a faked chemical attack.

The Kremlin's tight control over the media will help Putin avoid any significant damage to his carefully nurtured image of a strong leader.

In fact, his cautious stance could boost his popularity further amid fears of war that swept Russia. In recent days, state media have been offering tips on how to behave in a nuclear conflict and what supplies to take to bomb shelters.

Most Russians will now heave a sigh of relief and feel grateful to Putin for pulling back from the brink. State TV channels compared what they described as U.S. President Donald Trump's reckless action with the responsible, statesmanlike stance taken by Putin.

Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an association of top Russian foreign policy and security experts, said on state TV that Moscow's warning to strike back "clearly hasn't come unnoticed by the Pentagon, and the strike was quite careful."

The Kremlin will also use the crisis to advance its narrative of an aggressive West that plunges the world into chaos and disregards international law. Russian officials and lawmakers compared it to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that was launched on claims that Baghdad was developing suspected nuclear weapons — allegations that proved to be false.

Commentators on state TV argued that Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May launched the attack to distract attention from their political problems at home.

For now, Putin has limited his response to calling an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

No military measures were immediately announced, but in a clear warning to the U.S. and its allies, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military's General Staff said Moscow could boost Syria's Soviet-era air defense assets with batteries of state-of-the-art S-300 missiles. He noted that Moscow so far has heeded Western requests not to provide the missiles to Damascus, but said it may now reconsider.

Rudskoi added that Moscow could also supply long-range missiles to unidentified other countries, a possible reference to Iran, which has taken deliveries of S-300s in the past.

The statement clearly was aimed at discouraging the West from more attacks on Syria that could endanger President Bashar Assad's gains on the battlefield, where Russian support has helped him secure control of most strategic areas.

Associated Press writer Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed.WASHINGTON (AP) — In heated exchanges with his national security team in recent weeks, President Donald Trump repeatedly made clear he saw little incentive for the United States to be involved in Syria's intractable civil war.

Then he pushed the U.S. military back into the quagmire.

In doing so, Trump is trying to confront a dilemma that haunted his predecessor, Barack Obama. Syria's seven-year civil war presents few fast or easy solutions for the U.S., yet the geopolitical rivalries at play, the presence of the Islamic State group and other extremists, and the atrocities perpetrated by the Assad government make the situation impossible to ignore.

Thus far, Trump and his top advisers have sent mixed messages about what Friday's U.S., British and French strikes may mean for his administration's future commitment in Syria.

The strikes themselves were limited — 105 weapons launched against three targets. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis described the action as a "one-time shot" in retaliation for the Syrian government's apparent use of chemical weapons in an April 7 attack that killed more than 40 people.

Trump, however, cast the strikes in more sweeping terms, promising he was ready to keep the U.S. military engaged if Syrian President Bashar Assad were to use deadly gases again.

"We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents," Trump said in a televised address to the nation from the White House on Friday night.

His comments were echoed Saturday by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who said the president told her the military was "locked and loaded" if Syria launched another chemical weapons attack.

The president's statement was a marked shift from his recent posture on Syria.

Earlier this month, he privately told advisers that the U.S. was getting "nothing" out of being involved in Syria and he made clear he wanted the 2,000 American troops currently there fighting ISIS militants out by the fall.

That order left many of Trump's national security advisers on edge, concerned that pulling out even that small U.S. force would result in a power vacuum that Iran could fill.

It did win him praise from political supporters who perceive Syria as a costly wasteland and see Trump as a president who promised an "America First" agenda that did not include sustained American military commitments overseas.

The importance of that pledge to some Trump backers quickly became apparent, with even the relatively limited American intervention in Syria leaving them deeply frustrated.

"This is not why Donald Trump got elected," said Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host who has been supportive of the president.

Ann Coulter, another conservative commentator, spent the weekend highlighting angry messages on Twitter from apparent Trump supporters, including one who wrote that while the "the direct damage was some buildings in Damascus; the collateral damage was Trump's political support base."

If Trump was bothered by the growing criticism, he didn't show it.

He took to Twitter on Saturday morning and wrote "Mission Accomplished" — adopting a phrase that haunted President George W. Bush during the Iraq war. For some, those two words represent the short-sightedness about how quickly the U.S. can become entangled in a protracted Middle East conflict.

Trump's view of the situation on Syria has shifted repeatedly in recent years. As a private citizen in 2013, he said Obama should "stay the hell out of Syria." Trump condemned Obama for declaring that Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a "red line" for the United States and he said it made Obama look weak when he didn't follow through with a military strike after Assad used deadly gases against civilians.

Less than three months after Trump took office, the U.S. assessed that Assad had again used chemical weapons to kill Syrians.

Moved by the images of dead children, Trump stunned many of his own supporters by saying that the action had crossed "many, many lines" for him. He ordered a U.S. airstrike on a Syrian air base.

Since then, Trump's views on the situation in Syria have evolved. Earlier this year, he began telling advisers that as soon as the U.S. could declare victory against IS, which has taken hold in Syria amid the chaos of the civil war, he wanted American troops out.

At a recent event in Ohio, Trump said of Syria: "Let other people take care of it now."

Just one week later came the attack that drew Trump back in.

An AP News AnalysisWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended her Saturday night tweet of a photo of President Donald Trump and his team being “briefed” about the Syria crisis, saying it was “not misleading at all” despite online chatter.

The tweet touted Trump’s decision on Friday to order military air strikes in Syria: “Last night the President put our adversaries on notice: when he draws a red line he enforces it.”

But the Twitterverse noted that the tweet included a photo of a briefing in the White House situation room that included Vice President Mike Pence, who was actually in Peru on Friday at a summit of Latin America leaders.

On Sunday, Sanders clarified that the photo came from a briefing earlier in the week. “It’s from Thursday meeting when he was briefed on Syria,” Sanders said in an email to Politico. “So no, not misleading at all.”

Sarah Huckabee Sanders Denies That White House Supports Slavery (Video)WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) attempted in an interview airing Sunday to frame his legacy on his own terms, brushing off the criticism that he facilitate President Donald Trump’s makeover of the Republican Party.

The speaker announced last week that he plans to retire at the end of his term to spend more time with his family. Ryan is finishing his career in Congress under Trump, a man he repeatedly criticized during the 2016 presidential campaign for racially charged, derogatory and vulgar statements and proposals but whose agenda he has helped enact.

NBC’ “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd asked Ryan about the criticism that he enabled the rise of Trump.

“Enabling ― So, so what did we do?” Ryan asked in the interview, which took place on Friday, according to a transcript provided by NBC News. He went on to spotlight what he sees as his own achievements ― such as establishing empowerment zones in poor communities, passing tax reform and spurring economic growth ― and said he hopes to accomplish more this year.

When pressed about Trump, Ryan said that they had agreed on an agenda, but wouldn’t say definitively whether they shared a vision for the GOP. “You’d have to ask him that,” Ryan said, adding that he and the president differed on policies for trade and some entitlement programs, but are “rolling in the same direction” on most things.

“Sure, no two people are going to agree on everything,” Ryan said. “We have different styles. We have different ideas. But it’s a big tent party. And we represent different corners of the tent.”

Todd read him a quote from former Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, who said of Ryan, “When people write the history of this era, it will be the triumph of Trumpism over Ryanism, and that’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.”

“I just don’t see it like that,” Ryan said.

The speaker also said that though it is Congress’ role to serve as a check on the executive branch if there is abuse of civil liberties or power, he didn’t see a need for one potential action: a bill that would bar the president from firing special counsel Robert Mueller. The Justice Department special counsel is investigating whether the Trump campaign worked with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.

Trump sought to have Mueller fired in December, The New York Times reported last week. The president denied that report and said he is taking a cooperative approach to dealing with the special counsel.

Ryan said that he did not think a bill to protect Mueller, which a bipartisan group of senators are pushing, would be necessary because the White House was not going to fire him.

“I don’t think he should be fired. I think he should be left to do his job,” Ryan said of Mueller. “And I don’t think they’re really contemplating this.”WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) attempted in an interview airing Sunday to frame his legacy on his own terms, brushing off the criticism that he facilitate President Donald Trump’s makeover of the Republican Party.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday defended his use of the phrase "Mission Accomplished" to describe a U.S.-led missile attack on Syria's chemical weapons program, even as his aides stressed continuing U.S. troop involvement and plans for new economic sanctions against Russia for enabling the government of Bashar Assad.

Stepping up the pressure on Syria's president, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley indicated the sanctions to be announced Monday would be aimed at sending a message to Russia, which she said has blocked six attempts by the U.N. Security Council to make it easier to investigate the use of chemical weapons.

"Everyone is going to feel it at this point," Haley said, warning of consequences for Assad's foreign allies.

"The international community will not allow chemical weapons to come back into our everyday life," she said. "The fact he was making this more normal and that Russia was covering this up, all that has got to stop."

In an early-morning tweet, Trump said the strike was "perfectly carried out" and that "the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term "Mission Accomplished." He added that he knew the media would "seize" on the phrase, but said it should be used often. "It is such a great Military term, it should be brought back," he wrote.

Trump tweeted "Mission Accomplished" on Saturday after U.S., French and British warplanes and ships launched more than 100 missiles nearly unopposed by Syrian air defenses. While he declared success, the Pentagon said the pummeling of three chemical-related facilities left enough others intact to enable the Assad government to use banned weapons against civilians if it chooses.

His choice of words recalled a similar claim associated with President George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a "Mission Accomplished" banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that would tie down U.S. forces for years.

On Sunday, Haley made clear the United States won't be pulling troops out of Syria right away, saying U.S. involvement there "is not done."

Haley said the three U.S. goals for accomplishing its mission are making sure chemical weapons are not used in a way that could harm U.S. national interests; that the Islamic State group is defeated; and that there is a good vantage point to watch what Iran is doing.

"We're not going to leave until we know we've accomplished those things," she said.

Haley said the joint military strike "put a heavy blow into their chemical weapons program, setting them back years" and reiterated that if Assad uses poison gas again, "the United States is locked and loaded."

The nighttime assault was carefully limited to minimize civilian casualties and avoid direct conflict with Russia in Syria, but confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, "Before we took action, the United States communicated with" Russia to "reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties."

Russia has military forces, including air defenses, in several areas of Syria to support Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.

Russia and Iran called the use of force by the United States and its French and British allies a "military crime" and "act of aggression." The U.N. Security Council met to debate the strikes, but rejected a Russian resolution calling for condemnation of the "aggression" by the three Western allies.

Assad denies he has used chemical weapons, and the Trump administration has yet to present hard evidence of what it says precipitated the allied missiles attack: a chlorine gas attack on civilians in Douma on April 7. The U.S. says it suspects that sarin gas also was used.

"Good souls will not be humiliated," Assad tweeted, while hundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus, the capital, where they flashed victory signs and waved flags in scenes of defiance after the early morning barrage.

The strikes "successfully hit every target," said Dana W. White, the chief Pentagon spokeswoman. The military said there were three targets: the Barzah chemical weapons research and development site in the Damascus area, a chemical weapons storage facility near Homs and a chemical weapons "bunker" a few miles from the second target.In this image released by the Department of Defense, a U.S. Air Force B-1 Bomber separates from the boom pod after receiving fuel from an Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker on April 13, 2018, en route to strike chemical weapons targets in Syria.

The Texan is seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate by pledging to repeal Barack Obama’s signature health care law, abolish the IRS and beat back federal overreach, even though the Trump administration has already diluted the health law, delivered sweeping tax cuts and code revisions and controls Washington along with a Republican-led Congress.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Ted Cruz ran a surprisingly effective presidential campaign in 2016. It sometimes sounds like he still is.

The Texan is seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate by pledging to repeal Barack Obama's signature health care law, abolish the IRS and beat back federal overreach — even though the Trump administration has already diluted the health law, delivered sweeping tax cuts and code revisions and controls Washington along with a Republican-led Congress.

Unmentioned — almost as if he hadn't noticed — is that the political world has been turned upside down around him. Indeed, Cruz, virtually alone among candidates here, barely refers to President Donald Trump and his paradigm-shifting repercussions since the election.

While other Texas political hopefuls want to tap into Trump's strong popularity with the Republican base, Cruz is sticking to his greatest policy hits, calculating that he has the stature to remain above the fray and can stick to the playbook that carried him from GOP primary also-ran to second place finisher in his first run for the White House. It's an agenda that would transition smoothly to another possible presidential run after 2020.

"Freedom doesn't defend itself," Cruz declared, drawing applause from a crowd of 200-plus inside an automatic mailing firm's headquarters in Austin, one of 12 cities where Cruz recently staged re-election kickoff rallies over three days.

The aloof approach especially suits Cruz, a strident tea party hero who delighted in infuriating both parties' congressional powerbrokers before Trump arrived to unhinge them even more. He bitterly opposed Trump at the end of the 2016 presidential campaign, was booed for refusing to endorse him at the Republican National Convention but eventually fell in line.

While Trump has careened away from some traditional GOP beliefs by supporting free market-busting tariffs, racking up federal debt and shrugging off family values and morality standards, Cruz can claim to have been an unflinching conservative all along.

"Steering clear of Trump allows him to be more about Cruz," said GOP strategist Brendan Steinhauser, a former national tea party organizer who directed the 2014 re-election campaign of Texas' senior senator, John Cornyn.

Cruz's stance differs from some other high-profile conservatives thought to have future presidential aspirations. Rather than keep his distance, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse has been outspokenly critical of the president and his volatile tweet eruptions, and could tap into Republicans looking for a new direction post-Trump. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley may emerge as top evangelists for Trump's post-presidency legacy.

Of Cruz, "it's early to say if what he's doing will play into how he's perceived as a national leader," Steinhauser said.

Someone else Cruz often ignores while campaigning is Democrat Beto O'Rourke, who is giving up his El Paso congressional seat to challenge Cruz. A bilingual, former punk rocker, O'Rourke garnered national attention for his energetic rallies and for frequently out-fundraising Cruz, even while shunning donations from outside political groups and special interests.

But O'Rourke failed to capture 40 percent of Democratic votes during Texas' March 6 primary against two little-known opponents while Cruz took 85 percent of GOP ballots, suggesting a Texas-sized name recognition gap with the incumbent.

O'Rourke said Cruz can't ignore the White House's current occupant while promoting his own record: "He's one of the primary enablers and abettors of this Trump administration."

"I don't know what his strategy is other than he's running for president," O'Rourke said.

Cruz has a new campaign slogan, "Tough as Texas," and uses it to highlight the heroism of people who rushed to aid their neighbors after Hurricane Harvey, as well as two citizens who helped bring to a stop a mass shooting in the town of Sutherland Springs. But his campaign stickers only feature Cruz's name and slogan, not mentioning 2018 or the office he's running for. During a stop along the Texas-Mexico border, he was even introduced as "President Cruz."

Cruz picked the venue for his Austin rally because he said it was an example of a small business hindered by Obama's health care law. He also frequently calls conservative talk radio stations across Texas to agree with hosts fuming about Republicans failing to keep their conservative promises.FILE - In this April 2, 2018, file photo, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, waves to supporters as he enters the room while campaigning for re-election at the National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 offices in Edinburg, Texas.

McClatchy DC reported Friday that Mueller has evidence that Michael Cohen, a longtime personal attorney for Trump, traveled to Prague months before the 2016 election.

The outlet cited two unnamed sources familiar with the matter. If the report is indeed true, it would mark a significant development in Mueller’s investigation.

“Bad reporting, bad information and bad story,” Cohen wrote Saturday in a tweet denying the McClatchy article.

Proof of the alleged trip would lend support to the Steele dossier ― the report by former British intelligence official Christopher Steele containing allegations that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to win the election. (The dossier is also how we know about the alleged “golden shower thing.”) It was funded by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

According to the dossier, Cohen played a part in the alleged conspiracy. It says he used a meeting with a Russian nongovernmental organization as cover to meet with Russian officials during a trip to Prague in August or September 2016. They allegedly discussed a “coverup and damage limitation operation in an attempt to prevent the full details of Trump’s relationship with Russia being exposed,” and discussed how to make “deniable cash payments” to “Romanian hackers.”

Cohen, for his part, says he’s never been to Prague. He even shared his passport with BuzzFeed to support his claim.

In his tweet on Saturday, the attorney said he was in Los Angeles with his son at the time in question.

“Proven!” he wrote.

However, the lack of a Czech stamp in Cohen’s passport does not necessarily rule out the possibility that he traveled to the Czech Republic.

Sources told McClatchy that Cohen traveled to Prague through Germany and did not require a passport “because both countries are in the so-called Schengen Area in which 26 nations operate with open borders.” The sources did not say whether Cohen would have used a commercial or private plane to fly to Europe, or why there does not appear to be a record of such a trip.

McClatchy notes that “it’s unclear whether Mueller’s investigators also have evidence that Cohen actually met with a prominent Russian ― purportedly Konstantin Kosachev, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ― in the Czech capital.”President Donald Trump’s lawyer is doubling down after a new report suggesting that special counsel Robert Mueller can prove a big part of the Steele dossier.

Promising to make everything right, Johnson promised a thorough investigation of the incident caught on video by a patron Thursday and shared widely online.

The men were accused of trespassing but have said they were waiting for a friend before ordering.

"The video shot by customers is very hard to watch and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values," Johnson said in a statement.

He added, "The basis for the call to the Philadelphia police department was wrong."

Philadelphia's police commissioner on Saturday defended the arrest, saying his officers had to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing.

Video of Thursday's incident showed other patrons telling officers the pair were doing nothing wrong and appeared to have been targeted merely because of their race.

Police Commissioner Richard Ross said he knew the incident had prompted a lot of concern, but said his officers "did absolutely nothing wrong."

In a video statement, Ross said store employees called 911 to report a disturbance and trespassing.

When officers arrived, Ross said, staff told them the two men had wanted to use the restroom but were informed it was only for paying customers. The pair repeatedly refused to leave when politely asked to do so by the employees and officers, he said.

"If you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, they (the officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that," Ross said.

"They were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen, and instead they got the opposite back."

Ross said that as an African-American man he was acutely aware of implicit bias. "We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department," he said.

The two men were released, Ross said, after officers learned Starbucks was "no longer interested" in prosecuting them.

In a post on Twitter earlier on Saturday, Starbucks Corp said it was sorry for what took place.

Johnson added his apology, saying the company would review its policies and "further train our partners to better know when police assistance is warranted."

Melissa DePino, an author who posted video of the arrest, said staff called police because the two men had not ordered anything while waiting for a friend. She said white customers were "wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing."

Police departments across the United States have come under criticism for repeated instances of killing unarmed black men in recent years, which activists blame on racial biases in the criminal justice system.

(Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Additional reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by David Gregorio and Clarence Fernandez)The 35-year-old singer has been recovering after a traumatic fall left her with a broken wrist and 40-50 stitches in her face.

Carrie Underwood is feeling like her old self again.

The 35-year-old singer has been seemingly hiding her face from the public eye ever since she suffered a scary fall at her home in Nashville, Tennessee, in November that required her to undergo surgery for a broken wrist and get 40 to 50 stitches on her face. But on Saturday, Underwood treated fans to the first selfie of her full face since the accident.

"Had a great rehearsal for the @acmawards! Can’t wait until tomorrow night! #CryPretty #ACMAwards," Underwood captioned the stunning close-up snapshot, which features the American Idol alum in full makeup, curled hair and wearing a printed top.

Just a day ago, the country superstar had posted a pic of herself "getting ready for the weekend." On Sunday, she'll be returning to the stage for the first time at the 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards, where she will also deliver the live debut performance of her latest song "Cry Pretty."

A source told ET on Thursday that Underwood is "totally back to normal and feeling great and healthy." Though, we shouldn't expect to see her posing for photographers on the carpet on Sunday's ACM Awards.

"She doesn’t think she will walk the red carpet at all because she’s just not ready to be bombarded by cameras," the source said.

For more on Underwood's recovery and new music, watch below. The 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards air live from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 15 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.

Related Articles:Among Major League Baseball’s vast rulebook is a simple yet obscure rule that’s always present in the action but rarely goes mentioned. It states that should a baserunner pass another live baserunner who’s ahead of him on the bases, he’ll be ruled out.

It’s hardly mentioned because it’s a rule that’s rarely violated. That’s because it’s basically second nature for players at the professional level to be aware of the runners ahead of them.

[Still not too late to join a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league]

As with any rule, there are always some exceptions. Unfortunately for Diamondbacks infielder Deven Marrero, he was the exception on Saturday night during his team’s 9-1 win against the Dodgers. Making it more painful, the rarely seen violation actually cost Marrero a home run.

Marrero, 27, slugged a ball over the fence against Dodgers left-hander Rich Hill for what he thought was a three-run homer. Alex Avila, who was occupying first base, saw it differently. He originally retreated to first thinking the baseball stayed in the yard and was caught by an outfielder.

By the time either player realized what was happening, Marrero passed Avila. Both immediately paused once it registered, then continued rounding the bases. The umpires allowed the play to continue, then changed the call after the Dodgers initiated a review.

Deven Marrero clobbers what looks like his first HR with the @Dbacks, but after review is called out for passing Alex Avila on the bases. Marrero is credited with a 2-run single and the #Dbacks lead 5-1 in the fourth. pic.twitter.com/3u1iEvuejn — FOX Sports Arizona (@FOXSPORTSAZ) April 15, 2018

Story Continues





It doesn’t seem fair to apply more blame to one player over the other. Avila simply lost track of the ball, while Marrero lost track of Avila. First base coach Dave McKay was overlooking the play too, and he clearly lost track of Avila. Heck, even the umpires weren’t sure enough to call it right away. It should never happen, but it’s surprising it doesn’t happen more often considering all the moving parts involved.

Deven Marrero (left) and Alex Avila of the Diamondbacks react after committing the ultimate baserunning blunder. (AP)

We’re confident it will never happen to Marrero or Avila again.

The home run would have been Marrero’s first in a Diamondbacks uniform and sixth overall in 117 MLB games. Since he made it to first base safely, he was credited with a single. That’s at least good for the batting average. He also gets credit for knocking in both runs.

Still, home runs are what all baseball players dream about. We can’t think of a more painful way to lose a homer than this.

The Diamondbacks hit four home runs that did count in Saturday’s win. Paul Goldschmidt hit his third of the season. A.J. Pollock hit his second and third. Naturally, the other was hit by Avila, which was his first for Arizona.

The Diamondbacks improved to 11-3 with the win. They’re 5-0 against Los Angeles this season.

Python trackers find record breeding group in Florida More

Burmese pythons are taking over the historic Everglades. Hunts are held regularly, but the number of snakes removed is not on pace with the rate at which the snakes are spreading. They compete with and prey on native species. The roaming sentinel, a male python named Argo, with a surgically implanted tracking device, needed just three days to lead researchers to the largest trove of pythons found yet in Collier County. It was a landmark discovery of the recently completed breeding season, just before Valentine’s Day. Argo had just found a 100-pound female python getting ready to lay eggs in a culvert. The female was captured, and Argo was let loose again to be tracked. Three days later and a

A mother who died after being set on fire by her boyfriend will testify in court from beyond the grave following a landmark ruling.

The video testimony of Judy Malinowski will be played by prosecutors during the murder trial of her ex-partner Michael Slager, an Ohio judge said on Friday.

Ms Malinowski died in June 2017, aged 33, two years after she was left with catastrophic burns after her boyfriend doused her in petrol and set her alight on a petrol station forecourt in Gahanna, near Columbus.

Slager, 42, was convicted of aggravated arson and felony assault in December 2016, but prosecutors began preparing a murder case against him after doctors said the mother-of-two would not survive her injuries.

As part of their work, they recorded Ms Malinowski’s sworn testimony from her hospital bedside in January 2017, compiling almost two hours of footage

They have now secured the right to play the video in court, a decision that will set a precedent for future criminal trials in Ohio.

Ruling the testimony should be heard, Judge Guy Reece said it was the first case he was aware of where a victim had given evidence at their accused killer’s trial.

“The state wanted to preserve her testimony due to her fragile medical condition,” he said.

“She was critically ill and was the only witness who could testify about the events that transpired on the day of her injury.”

The attack left Ms Malinowski with burns covering 80 per cent of her body. She also lost both her ears, two fingers and much of her hair.

She also struggled to talk as a result of injuries to her trachea and resorted to communicating using whispers and nods.

Bonnie Bowes, Ms Malinowski’s mother, said her daughter had always believed her testimony would have been used in court.

“To me, it was whether or not Judy’s voice was going to be heard,” she told Columbus news station 10 TV.

“Judy went through this traumatic experience and she went to her grave thinking that the judicial system would unseal her side of the story.

“So it was really important to me that that happens.”

Slager has always maintained he never intended to set Ms Malinowski on fire and did so by accident while lighting a cigarette.

His trial is set for July, when prosecutors will be seeking the death penalty.

NEW YORK -- Former first lady Barbara Bush is in failing health and will not seek additional medical care after a series of recent hospitalizations, a spokesman for the Bush family said Sunday. Bush, 92, will "instead focus on comfort care" for unspecified health complications, according to a statement. Bush is the wife of former President George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States who is now 93, and mother of 43rd President George W. Bush. She is only the second first lady in American history whose her son also ascend to the nation's highest office, the other being Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams and mother of John Quincy Adams. "It will not surprise those who know her that

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Barbara Bush, the wife of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, is in "failing health" and has decided to no longer seek medical treatment, the office of the ex-president said in a statement from Houston on Sunday.

The former first lady, who is also the mother of former President George W. Bush, "will instead focus on comfort care," the statement said. She is 92 years old.

The brief statement did not indicate the nature of Bush's illness but said that she had had a series of recent hospitalizations.

CNN reported that Bush was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure. A Bush family spokesman said she was being cared for at her home. He did not provide information on the nature of her illness.

"She is surrounded by a family she adores and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving," the statement added.

As first lady from 1989 until the start of 1993, Bush was a popular national figure known for her sometimes blunt talk and self-deprecating wit.

Her husband, the 41st U.S. president, is 93 years old. Her son, the 43 U.S. president, is 71.

Another son, Jeb, is a former governor of Florida who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2015 and early 2016, quitting after a series of lackluster performances highlighted by tough skirmishes with then-candidate Donald Trump.

With hair that had turned white prematurely, Bush was known by family members as the "Silver Fox."

Her work as first lady focused on promoting literacy and reading. At the time, she said she was more interested in running a household than in helping her husband run the country.

Bush holds a unique place in U.S. history.

She is the only woman to see her husband and son sworn in as U.S. president. Abigail Adams, first lady from 1797 to 1801, was a major influence on husband John Adams, the nation's second president, but died before her son, John Quincy Adams, was elected president in 1824.

Donald Trump, the US president, has called for former FBI director James Comey to be jailed, accusing him of revealing classified information and of lying to Congress.

In addition to suggesting the former intelligence chief be incarcerated, Mr Trump called him "slippery" and a "slimeball" and said he would go down as the worst FBI director in history, during a Twitter rant which spanned the course of two hours on Sunday morning.

He also challenged accusations made by the former FBI director in a tell-all book that is due for release this week.

Mr Trump wrote: "The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more?"

He added: "I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!"

And shortly after came: "Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!"

The two men have been involved in a ferocious war of words since the president fired Mr Comey last May amid the investigation into his 2016 campaign and Russian meddling in the election.

It was Mr Comey's firing that prompted the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Mr Comey later testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him for "loyalty" at a January dinner. And that alone in the Oval Office, Mr Trump had said to him that he "hoped" he could let the investigation into former national security director Michael Flynn "go".

His evidence opened up the president to accusations of obstruction of justice, which Mr Trump has repeatedly and strongly denied.

Mr Comey's memoir, "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership" is released on Tuesday, but has already become a bestseller thanks to huge pre-publication sales.

On Sunday, ABC was due to air a lengthy interview to kick off Mr Comey's book tour, which was expected to attract millions of viewers.

Extracts that emerged last week showed Mr Comey likened the president to an “unethical” mob boss who is "untethered" to the truth, casts his inner circle poorly and details an obsession with a dossier written by former British spy Christopher Steele who wrote of rumoured engagements with prostitutes.

Mr Comey writes: “What is happening now is not normal. It is not fake news. It is not okay,” describing “the forest fire that is the Trump presidency”.

Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s approval rating stands at its highest since his first 100 days in office at 40 per cent. The Washington Post-ABC News poll showed his popularity up four per cent from January.

Among white voters, he has 53 per cent support, up seven points since the beginning of the year and among white men without college degrees he is up six percent to 70 per cent.

Almost three-quarters of conservatives approve of the president in the latest poll, 74 per cent, up nine points from January.Former U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg reacts to President Trump's tweets about the Department of Justice and comments made by former FBI Director James Comey in his new book.

Despite finishing last week with gains, the Dow and the S&P 500 still remain in the red for the year with investors continuing to find themselves at the mercy of the volatile political news cycle.

“While volatility remains alive and well, the market managed to have a good showing [last] week,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group on Friday. “While it’s nice to see, it’s important to remember that conditions still have a ways to go before stabilizing.”

Stocks on Friday closed in the red and reacted negatively to an NBC News report which suggested President Donald Trump — who called former FBI director Jim Comey an “untruthful slime ball” on Friday — will likely fire Rod Rosenstein.

Rosenstein is the deputy Attorney General leading the Russia probe after AG Jeff Sessions recused himself. This has also led many in markets to speculate that Trump could also move to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. As of Sunday morning, both men remained in their roles.

The stock market is still a mess

This past week, the major U.S. indexes finished with gains of about 1%. But the Dow and the S&P 500 failed to recoup their year-to-date losses after having made a run at getting back into positive territory for the year earlier in the week. And the longer markets continue in this period of higher volatility while failing to make new highs, the more skeptical investors are likely to become about the health of the bull market.

In a note earlier in the week, Credit Suisse analysts said the outflows from passive funds investing in the U.S. stock market over the last two months are the highest since 2008. The volatility seen in early February and which has continued is clearly spooking investors.

Meanwhile, the final three days of this past trading week were the three lowest volume days of the year, signaling a decreased appetite for new money coming into the stock market, especially as many corporations are currently unable to make new discretionary repurchases of their own stock.

On Tuesday of this past week, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, cut her year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 2,890 from 3,000. “The bull is limping,” Calvasina said, “but still moving forward.” Wall Street strategists are clearly growing skeptical that the double-digit returns so many had called for in 2018 will materialized, but are not yet ready to call for outright declines in the market.By Kate Holton

LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, who built WPP into the world's biggest advertising agency through 33 years of dealmaking, quit on Saturday after an allegation of personal misconduct.

The departure of the CEO who built a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies with 200,000 staff in 112 countries leaves WPP without a boss at a pivotal time for the industry and when the group is under great strain.

WPP stunned the market last week when it said it had appointed lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sorrell. He denied the allegations but in a letter to WPP staff published late on Saturday he said the "current disruption" was "putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business".

He said he had decided that "in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside".

Chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman until a new chief executive is found, while Mark Read, a WPP digital executive, and Andrew Scott, chief operating officer, Europe, have been appointed as joint chief operating officers.

Read, who previously sat on WPP's main board, is well regarded in the industry while Scott was involved in its acquisition strategy and was not involved with clients.

The company will consider internal and external candidates for the top job in a process that could take several months.

"Obviously I am sad to leave WPP after 33 years," Sorrell said in a statement. "It has been a passion, focus and source of energy for so long. However, I believe it is in the best interests of the business if I step down now."

WPP said the investigation, which regarded financial impropriety, had concluded. It made no further comment but repeated a previous statement that the allegation did not involve amounts that were material to the company.

A source close to Sorrell said he had been unhappy with how the investigation was handled, leaving him uncertain whether he could work with the board again.

Analysts have speculated that the sprawling group, which was being restructured after a year of lower spending from some clients, could now sell off some assets if led by different management.





PASSION AND FOCUS

The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into one of Britain's biggest companies by three decades of relentless dealmaking. He is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in the country.

In his time the group expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers, market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury.

Present in 112 countries, WPP serves clients including Ford, Unilever, P&G and a string of major corporations around the world.

It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom, Publicis and IPG in the years that followed the financial crisis as the group pitched aggressively for new work. But it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in spending from consumer goods groups Unilever and P&G, and the loss of some big accounts.

The migration of advertising online and the encroachment into market research of consultancies such as Accenture have compounded the pressures. Its shares are down around 30 percent this year.

The company said Sorrell would be available to assist with the transition, and the man synonymous with the British marketing group told the staff they would come through this difficult time.

"As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that," Sorrell said. "Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now back to the future."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Saturday called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council as Moscow said it would consider supplying S-300 missile systems to Syria following U.S.-led strikes.

"Russia convenes an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss aggressive actions of the U.S. and its allies," President Vladimir Putin said in a statement published on the Kremlin website.

"The current escalation of the situation around Syria has a devastating impact on the whole system of international relations," he added.

U.S., British and French forces pounded Syria with more than 100 missiles early on Saturday in response to a poison gas attack that killed dozens of people last week, in the biggest intervention by Western powers against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Putin said the U.S. actions in Syria made the humanitarian catastrophe worse and caused pain for civilians.

"Russia in the most serious way condemns the attack on Syria where Russian military servicemen help the legitimate government to fight terrorism," Putin said.

MISSILES FOR SYRIA

Moscow may consider supplying S-300 surface to-air missile systems to Syria and "other countries", Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoi told a televised briefing on Saturday.

Russia had "refused" supplying those missiles to Syria a few years ago, he added, "taking into account the pressing request of some of our Western partners".

Following the U.S.-led strikes, however, "we consider it possible to return to examination of this issue not only in regard to Syria but to other countries as well," Rudskoi said.

Syria's air defence system, which mostly consists of systems made in the Soviet Union, has intercepted 71 of the missiles fired on Saturday by the U.S., British and French forces, he added.

"In the past year and a half Russia has fully restored Syria's air defence system and continues to further upgrade it," Rudskoi said.

The GLD ETF represents fractional, undivided beneficial ownership interests in a trust whose sole assets are gold bullion on and, from time to time, cash. So the GLD ETF is one step removed from actually holding gold in your own vault. The question is whether or not you should own the GLD ETF and, if so, under what parameters?

The Problem With Gold

The truth is that precious metals don’t really make for a very good long-term investment. Psychology plays a very big part in the price of gold at any particular moment, as well as demand for gold in various parts of industry.

Gold has traditionally been seen as a hedge against inflation. The inflation-adjusted price of gold was $2,200 per ounce in 1979 and it fell to just under $400/ounce in 2000. So, I suppose you could say it was a hedge against inflation.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, the sad truth is that the price of gold went nowhere from 1915 to 1975. One might even argue that it went nowhere all the way through 2005. I suppose it’s all well and good that, adjusting for inflation, gold held its value for almost an entire century. The problem is that nobody holds gold buillon for 90 years. As a long-term investment, then, the GLD ETF is not going to deliver growth.

That is the big difference between precious metals and stocks. Over time the stock market has a positive bias. Going back to the stock market’s earliest days, and tracking it to today, the markets have obviously gone significantly higher. That is because stock prices tend to follow earnings. Earnings tend to rise over time because economies tend to grow over time. Economies tend to grow over time because, as opposed to what misinformed ideological wonks want you to believe, wealth is in fact created from nothing. Stocks therefore have a positive expectation over time. A Gold ETF does not. And while were talking about that, gambling at the casino has a negative expectation over time. That’s why you want to invest in casino stocks rather than play casino games.

The Argument for Gold

So does GLD have any place in your portfolio?

I’m sure readers who know about my fondness for non-correlated investments, meaning investments that do not track with the overall market over time, would think that precious metals do have a place in a long-term diversified portfolio. In point of fact, my investment advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio, does not have and does not intend to have any kind of precious metal holdings. That’s because the point of non-correlated investments, and The Liberty Portfolio, is to reduce overall volatility in the portfolio. Gold and precious metals tend to have a great deal of volatility.

The way to play gold, in my opinion, is to trade it. But you cannot just trade willy-nilly. Technical analysis is your friend when it comes to trading gold, but because psychological sentiment is all over the place, you will frequently find that technical analysis is actually very little help.

The only real technical analysis that is going to help you is when gold is trading at extreme valuations on either end. If gold flies back up over $1,800/ounce, that would be a time to short. If gold falls below $1000, that’s fairly likely an opportunity to go long. In both cases, however, I would set stop losses of 7 to 10%.

Otherwise, I would avoid GLD altogether.

The post Why Gold Does Not Belong in Your Portfolio appeared first on InvestorPlace.It’s been a rough road for Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI). For many years, before the parent company consolidated all of its elements into a single entity, the master limited partnership was considered a very reliable dividend stock. Kinder Morgan LP was constantly referred to as the blue-chip of pipeline master limited partnership stocks.

Then the bottom fell out of the oil market. Prices plunged, and with them the earnings of virtually every energy-based company. As I’ve often warned investors, a stock can have a very reliable dividend, but no matter how high that dividend is, it will mean nothing if the stock loses 60% of its value.

The Troubles at Kinder Morgan Inc

KMI stock has had its ups and down since then. KMI stock generates operating income, as well as net income. The last two years, KMI stock has generated positive free cash flow, although that was not the case in 2015.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, just as things seemed to be on the upswing for KMI stock, a very bizarre thing happened up in Canada. The company has been working on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, a $6 billion infrastructure work that has received strong opposition from the current government in British Columbia, as well as protesters on the ground.

Last autumn, KMI stock spun off its Canadian subsidiary, into Kinder Morgan Canada Limited (OTCBB:KMLGF), raising $1.3 billion for the sole purpose of funding the pipeline expansion in Canada. Well, right before the IPO finished, Canada’s new Democratic Party allied with the Green party, with the goal of killing the expansion project.

Kinder Morgan has gone through the entire process, from regulatory to environmental and more, in order for the project to go through. However, late last week, KMI management has decided to pull the plug, as opposition to the pipeline reached peak shrillness.

Pipeline Problems

As usual, it is the misguided stance of environmental groups that get in the way of a necessary pipeline project. The Trans-Mountain expansion project would simply parallel the nearly 700-mile existing pipeline, built back in 1953, and is the only West Coast link for Western Canadian oil. The capacity for transport would nearly triple to 900,000 barrels per day. The nixing of the pipeline, in turn, disrupts oil shipping companies. The shippers made commitments of up to 20 years that would add 80% of the capacity.

Now, let’s not kid ourselves. The move by Kinder Morgan is political, to put pressure on the provincial government. This, in turn, shifts the focus over to the federal government. The Canadian federal government does not want to send a message that Canada is unfriendly to business, particularly energy interests. Canada’s natural resources minister offered to possibly invest in the KMI pipeline project “if it would bring certainty” to the project.

Prime Minister Trudeau is in a bit of a pickle, because he approved the expansion himself in 2016.

Bottom Line on KMI Stock

Either way, I think this will work out okay for Kinder Morgan stock owners. I think the project will start back up again. Either the federal government will invest alongside KMI stock management, effectively insulating the project from provincial politics, or the federal government may simply buy out the entire project and partner with the province of Ottawa, which has expressed interest in the project.

Your IRS tax refund will typically be available within 21 days if you file electronically.

Filing taxes electronically with direct deposit ensures the refund gets to your bank account quicker, the IRS says.

The IRS has resources to help you file your taxes and get your refund quickly.



Most people dread filing their taxes — but nearly everyone is hoping for a refund. Procrastinators have a couple of extra days to file their return this year, as Tax Day falls on April 17 instead of the standard April 15.

The Internal Revenue Service reports that about 83% of tax returns result in refunds. If you're one of the lucky ones who can expect to get money back this year, you may be wondering exactly when you will receive your refund.

The short answer is almost certainly within three weeks of when you file your taxes. But there are ways to get it sooner.

Filing online is the quickest way to get your tax refund. Using snail mail will get the job done but take more time.

For a quicker refund, the IRS suggests you e-file and request your refund via direct deposit, the chosen method for most taxpayers. The IRS says direct deposit — which the government also uses for Social Security and Veterans Affairs payments — is "simple, safe, and secure."

If you filed electronically, you should receive a refund within 21 days. The IRS updates its system daily, usually overnight.

The traditional paper-and-pencil option means, in most cases, your refund will arrive within six weeks of of filing. If it doesn't, an error or incompletion may be holding up the process.

Taxpayers can check the status of their tax refund using the IRS's return-tracking service within 24 hours of filing your tax return online — but to do so, you'll need three things:

Your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.

Your filing status.

The exact refund amount.

The IRS also says the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit cannot be issued until mid-February as a means to protect against identity theft and tax fraud. Those refunds will be ready as soon as February 27.

The new Republican tax law will not change the tax-filing process this year — it goes into effect for income earned in 2018, meaning you'll see the effects when you file your taxes next year.

DON'T MISS: Taxpayers will get an extra couple of days before filing their taxes next year — here's when tax day is in 2018Your accountant or tax software says you’re getting a $1,000 refund on your taxes. But when the check arrives, it’s only $250. What gives? That’s $750 short of your rightful $1,000.

When you go check online through the IRS’ Where’s My Refund tool, you see a notification. Your tax return has just been “offset.” Due to an outstanding debt that you forgot about or perhaps an overdue bill that has accrued interest and penalties, the IRS has decided to offset your tax return. This is called a tax return offset.

Click to read more about why you shouldn’t assume you’re getting a tax refund.

This type of scenario can happen to almost anyone who has overdue debts. If you owe a federal or state debt, you can see your federal payments taken to repay the debt and fees associated with it. You aren’t without options. There are ways to prepare yourself.

Who Can Offset Your Tax Return?

When it comes to offsetting your tax return, those making the request must go through the IRS. It is then up to the IRS if they want to grant the request. This basically means anyone can go after your tax return. Federal agencies have a higher chance of being successful at offsetting your tax return. Collection agencies for credit card companies have virtually no chance.

Here’s a list of the most common entities that are likely to offset your tax return:

– IRS

– Federal agencies (student loans, Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] loans, penalties or fines to these agencies)

– State taxes

– Owed child support

– Unemployment compensation

In the case of child support, Emily Beach said a tax offset generally “kicks in if you owe more than $150 in state-assigned tax support payments or more than $500 in child support payments to an individual, such as your child’s custodial parent.”

In the case of non-federal collection agencies trying to offset your tax return, there’s very little chance this will ever happen. The IRS website provides more detail on how the IRS collects taxes owed through tax returns: People who have slipped up on their student loan or child support payments had their refund status money taken because of the collection agencies requesting it from the IRS. The IRS as an entity does not collect on debts except for taxes owed to them.

The debt of your spouse can be a factor in your tax return being offset if you are married and filing jointly. Debts that can be collected are the same government debts mentioned above. If the debt is exclusively that of your spouse, you can file Form 8379 to claim a portion of the tax return for you as an individual. This is also called “Injured Spouse.”

There is another term called “Innocent Spouse,” which is relief from tax liabilities including interest and penalties. You can read about both on the IRS website.

There are cases when you might consider filing separately due to debt owed by one spouse and not the other.

This is especially true if you’re dealing with student loan debt. If you’re in default on your student loans and see your tax return garnished, you might consider filing separately. This also allows you to potentially get a lower repayment plan amount if you’re on Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

Learn more here about the implications of filing separately for student loans.

What Rights Do You Have?

To avoid being blindsided by a tax return offset, there are a few things you can do. First is to wait for a notice from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), which is part of the Department of the Treasury, and issues refunds and tracks offsets. The BFS will have the following in its notice:

– Original refund amount

– Your refund offset amount

– Agency receiving the payment

– Address and telephone number of the agency

If you don’t receive the above notice, you can call the BFS directly. Once you call them, listen to the message and do as instructed. You’ll enter your Social Security number, and it will check to see if there is a tax offset against you. If there is, write down any information provided so that you can call and get additional information. The database is updated consistently, so you can call and check as often as you’d like.

You can also check your credit report and see if there are any debts in default listed.

LONDON (AP) -- Martin Sorrell is stepping down as chief executive of WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, following allegations of personal misconduct.

Sorrell, who built WPP into a global brand during his 33 years at the helm, had been accused of misusing company assets. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Sorrell resigned Saturday night as WPP announced that an investigation into the matter had concluded, with the firm saying only that "the allegation did not involve amounts that are material."

"As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business," Sorrell said in a statement to WPP staff. "That is why I have decided that, in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside."

Chairman Roberto Quarta will lead the company until a new chief executive has been chosen.

Sorrell is a titan of British business who was named the world's second-best performing CEO in 2017 by the Harvard Business Review. He took a U.K. manufacturer of wire baskets and built it into a worldwide provider of advertising, public relations and marketing services through a series of takeovers.

The acquisitions included the J. Walter Thompson Group, the Young & Rubicam Group and the Ogilvy Group.

He was richly compensated for his efforts.

Sorrell was the highest-paid CEO among FTSE 100 companies in both 2015 and 2016, according to a study released last year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the High Pay Centre. He received 70.4 million pounds ($100.3 million) in salary, bonuses, incentive rewards, pension payments and other benefits in 2015, and 48.1 million pounds in 2016, the study found.

"If WPP does well, I do well," he told the Press Association in April 2016. "Most of my wealth, if not all of it, is and has been for the last 31 years tied up in the success of WPP. So if WPP does well, I do well, and others in the company do well. If we do badly, we suffer."Martin Sorrell's departure from WPP has been described as one of the most significant âexits of a FTSE 100 company chief executive for many years (AFP Photo/Justin TALLIS)

London (United Kingdom) (AFP) - Martin Sorrell's dramatic departure as chief executive of WPP, the world's biggest advertising agency he founded 33 years ago, sent shockwaves through the marketing industry on Sunday.

Sorrell, 73, stepped down suddenly, 10 days after the British ad giant launched an independent investigation into allegations of personal misconduct through the misuse of company assets.

WPP said the probe had concluded, adding that "the allegation did not involve amounts that are material".

He was easily the longest serving chief executive of a company on London's benchmark FTSE 100 share index, having held the position since 1985.

The departure of one of Britain's best-known businessmen leaves the advertising giant needing fresh leadership at a testing time for the marketing industry, with social media companies offering brands a direct connection with vast audiences.

Sorrell said in a statement late Saturday that he was sad to leave, with WPP having been his passion and focus for more than three decades.

"The current disruption is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business, our over 200,000 people and their 500,000 or so dependents, and the clients we serve in 112 countries," he said.

"That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside."

Sky News television's City editor Mark Kleinman said his resignation was one of the most significant âexits of a FTSE 100 company chief executive for many years.

"His departure will leave the company he built virtually from âscratch facing profound questions about its future direction," he said.

- Buffeted by competition -

Despite the misconduct investigation, some commentators said it was the fact that the company had lost a third of its value over the past 12 months -- in the face of competition from the likes of Google and Facebook -- that cost Sorrell his post.

Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said his legacy as an advertising industry titan was secure.

However, "in the end, it was the trends in world business that wrong-footed the sprawling empire he created.

"Shareholders were getting restless," he wrote, and Sorrell "had lost the unanimous backing of the board".

WPP said Sorrell would be treated as having retired, with chairman Roberto Quarta becoming executive chairman until a new chief executive is appointed.

"Sir Martin has been the driving force behind the expansion of WPP to create the global leader in marketing services," said Quarta.

"During this time, the company has been successful because it has valued and nurtured outstanding talent at every level."

Sorrell denied any wrongdoing after the allegations surfaced earlier this month, but said he understood the company had to investigate.

- Huge pay packet -

Born in London, Sorrell studied economics at the University of Cambridge and then gained a masters from Harvard University.

He joined the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising agency in 1975 before founding WPP.

He formed it from a shell company, Wire and Plastic Products, re-establishing what had been a wire baskets manufacturer as a marketing services group in 1986.

The firm has grown into one of the world's largest communications groups and now has some 3,000 offices.

He received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.

Sorrell made headlines in recent years regarding his sizeable pay at a time when traditional advertising groups struggle against fierce competition from the likes of Google and Facebook.

According to research from the High Pay Centre think-tank, Sorrell was Britain's best-paid boss in 2015, with a package of more than Â£70 million ($100 million, 80 million euros) that year.

However, he always fiercely defended his income, saying it was related to how well the company he started from nothing was doing.

"Yes he was relentless and richly rewarded -- but let's not forget Sir Martin Sorrell built a global advertising empire from nothing," said Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times newspaper.

The Sunday Times newspaper's Rich List 2017 said he was worth Â£495 million, with his assets up Â£100 million over the previous 12 months.Martin Sorrell spent the last three decades building an obscure maker of wire baskets into a global advertising powerhouse, earning millions and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II along the way. His downfall was far swifter.

Sorrell, 73, said late Saturday that he would resign from his position as chief executive office of WPP Plc with immediate effect. His departure followed allegations of personal misconduct and misuse of company assets and comes days before the board was set to publish the findings of their investigation. Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing.

The WPP chief was the de facto elder statesman of the ad industry and a figurehead of corporate Britain, appearing regularly in public to discuss issues from Brexit to Donald Trump's trade wars to the rise of Inc. and . He also courted controversy with his pugnacious manner and inflated pay package, particularly at a time when WPP's revenue stalled.

In a statement to WPP employees, Sorrell said the current disruption was putting "too much unnecessary pressure on the business" and that in the interest of the company and clients it was "best for me to step aside."

"As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that," Sorrell said in the statement late Saturday. "Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you."

The bittersweet taste of his departure was apparent in his farewell note, which laid out in great detail the long journey of WPP from humble beginnings to an empire of more than 400 agencies across 112 countries, counting 200,000 employees. He said he'd spent every day of the last 33 years thinking about the future of the company, which he built into the world's largest and most successful advertising firms.

Fall From Grace

Sorrell's fall from grace took less than a month after WPP announced April 3 that it was investigating the allegations. Chairman Roberto Quarta now becomes executive chairman until the appointment of a new CEO, WPP said in a statement late Saturday. Mark Read, who heads WPP agency Wunderman, and Andrew Scott, WPP's corporate development director, become joint chief operating officers.

The resignation preempts what could have been an inglorious departure. Sorrell was set to join the rest of the board early next week for scheduled meetings ahead of the company's quarterly results, making a quick resolution of the probe almost inevitable.

The investigation into Sorrell has now concluded, WPP said, reiterating that the amounts weren't material.

"It's favorable for WPP that the issue was resolved fast enough that it wouldn't have become a distraction, and the interim leadership choice looks like a positive move as well," said Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research LLC, by email. "However, there will be great interest in resolving the full-time CEO role as soon as possible."

Full-Time CEO

Sorrell's 1985 investment in Wire & Plastic Products and a string of acquisitions of advertising companies that followed in effect founded WPP, making him an executive seen by some as irreplaceable for his direct access to clients and active hand on a sprawling network of agencies.

For years, the board supported his outsize pay packages amid shareholder complaints because he delivered. He earned about 200 million pounds ($284 million) over the last five years, largely due to a lucrative performance-related bonus package.

But beyond the investigation that leaked this month, there were other signs Sorrell was losing his magic touch. WPP's financial guidance has repeatedly proved too optimistic, and its shares have lost a third of their value over the past year — far more than rivals facing the same market challenges of reduced ad spending and competition from web giants.

WPP on March 1 lowered its long-term profit outlook after reporting its worst annual performance since the global financial crisis, capping a string of disappointments that put Sorrell on the defensive.

Succession Planning

The probe served to intensify scrutiny on Sorrell and WPP's succession planning, long criticized by investors as being insufficient, prompting speculation that a CEO long seen as unstoppable might be forced to step aside.

Sorrell's abrupt departure contrasts with the fate of arch-rival and fellow advertising elder statesman Maurice Levy, the 76-year-old who led Publicis Groupe SA for 30 years before taking on the role of chairman of its supervisory board. New-York based Inc., another WPP competitor, recently consolidated the CEO and chairman role in John Wren, who has led the company for two decades.The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is reflected in a street vendor's mirror in New York, U.S., on Monday, March 5, 2018.

You can throw all the 2 percent days and all the Trump tweets you want at investors. They’re not quitting stocks. At least not yet.

During a placid week for equities, enthusiasm for the market picked up. Investors poured $5.6 billion of fresh cash into mutual funds at the start of April, the fourth-most in a decade, while exchange-traded funds stemmed the worst outflows since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, users of day-trading securities that pay two or three times the S&P 500 Index’s return remained convinced they can make money from all the jarring ups and downs.

Headlines surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade policy and Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony to Congress were little more than noise. Why not, when corporate America is kicking off what may be the best earnings season in seven years?

Sentiment is far from euphoric levels seen in late January after a two-month tumult wiped off $3 trillion of equity values. But there was little to indicate any permanent damage to the buy-the-dip mentality that has ruled markets for the last five years.

“We’re not looking for earnings to decline or the kind of falls that would lead to concerns that we’re entering a recession or a bear market,” said John Carey, a fund manager for Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “All the signs point to a strong economy,” he said. “The impulse to buy on dips is not quite so pronounced, but still alive.”

The S&P 500 rose 2 percent over past five days, with only one session experiencing moves of more than 1 percent. That’s in contrast with the previous two weeks, when the index swung that much in all but two days and rose or fell 2 percent or more three times. The Cboe Volatility Index dropped 19 percent over the week to the lowest level in a month.

Investors have warmed up to stocks, taking advantage of cheaper valuations as the earnings expansion remains on track and economic data has suggested worries over inflation was overblown. At 17 times forecast profit, the S&P 500 traded at the lowest multiple in two years.

ETFs focusing on U.S. equities attracted almost $9 billion of fresh money over the past week, reversing a quarter of the outflows seen over the last two months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“People are starting to settle down,” John Iborg, a portfolio manager at QS Investors, which manages $22 billion, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “They’re starting to get their senses about inflation expectations and how that might not necessarily be the biggest thing eating at equity risk right now.”

In the market’s most excitable corners, where traders use leveraged ETFs as a way to target short-term bets on up-and-down swings, conviction have been unshakable. Money has poured into securities that are long S&P 500 stocks and drained out of those that are short. Thanks to inflows, assets of leveraged long funds have kept growing this year in spite of falling stock prices. The market capitalization of bullish products has eclipsed that of inverse notes since November, with their ratio topping 2 in January for the first time ever.

Not only haven’t investors bailed, they’re headed back into stocks seen as more risky. Small-cap stocks have beaten their large-cap counterparts this month and companies that recently went public outperformed the S&P 500. Volatility has been sought with jumpy shares outpacing calm ones.

The risk-on behavior bodes well for equities, according to Jeff deGraaf, Renaissance Macro Research’s co-founder. “These factors firming in concert is more supportive of upside,” he said.

Read Investors Aren’t Quitting Stocks—Yet on bloomberg.comLet bank earnings be your guide, investors.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday and Friday. Here are five things the reports show about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tax cuts and how the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes are affecting consumers.

JPMorgan and Citigroup are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS.

1) Taxes Are Already Padding Profits at U.S. Corporations.

Deep cuts in U.S. corporate tax rates, thanks to President Donald Trump's fiscal-stimulus law inked in December, are already serving up a windfall to the big banks - even with less-than-stellar performance in core areas such as loan growth.

To see the impact, just compare the financial companies' pre-tax profit growth in the first quarter with after-tax results. JPMorgan's pre-tax profit climbed by 28% from a year earlier. But net income, after taxes, soared by 35%. At Wells Fargo, pre-tax profit actually declined last quarter by 5%. But thanks to the tax cuts, the bank was able to report a 5% increase in net income.

Aside from simply helping the companies' CEOs look better on paper, the tax bounty represents money that can be paid out to shareholders in the form of fat dividends or stock buybacks -- instead of the government.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told investors on a conference call Thursday that corporate executives are already starting to move money around due to the tax cuts -- a phenomenon that can be viewed in flows in and out of the company's various investment funds, which have $6 trillion-plus of assets under management.

"We saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases," Fink said. "And we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform."

TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer analyzes bank earnings below.

2) Tax Cuts Are Making It Easier for Borrowers to Repay Their Loans -- Another Bonus for Banks.

Bank executives expect Trump's tax cuts to leave borrowers with more cash to repay debts - leading to lower loan losses and, in turn, bigger profits for the banks. That's especially helpful now that the Federal Reserve is raising U.S. interest rates, which increases the cost of floating-rate loan payments while making it more expensive for borrowers to refinance fixed-rate debt when it comes due.

"Across the board, actually, all the way from small business through middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings, more free cash flow, and generally speaking that would improve the credit quality of the portfolio," JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake told investors on a conference call. "No doubt it helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment. There's a lot of plusses and minuses but yes, it's a tailwind for credit overall."

3) Consumers Are Responding to Higher U.S. Interest Rates by Taking Out Fewer Home Loans.

As interest rates rise, refinancing a mortgage becomes a less-attractive option for many existing homeowners, while new-home buyers face less affordable monthly payments on loans for purchases. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes - the key driver of mortgage rates - currently are around 2.8%. But bank executives are starting to worry that a move above 3% could hit mortgage-underwriting profits hard.

In the first quarter, Wells Fargo originated $43 billion of home loans, down from $53 billion in the fourth quarter.

"Businesses like mortgage will do better on the origination front if longer rates remain at about where they are today, versus begin to move above 3%," Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry told investors on a separate conference call. "There's some question about affordability in some markets, and so originations come down."

4) Banks Are Still Pocketing Higher Interest Rates -- Rather Than Passing Them on to Customers.

Rather than pass along higher interest rates to individual savers in the form of higher deposit rates, big banks are mostly pocketing the extra money they collect from rising loan rates. Corporations, on the other hand, are seeing big increases in their deposit rates because banks are so keen to keep them happy as lucrative customers.

The metric to watch is "deposit beta" - essentially the percentage of each Fed rate hike that gets passed along to customers. The higher the number, the better it is for savers; the lower the number, the better it is for bank profits.

John Gerspach, Citigroup's CFO, told investors: "As we continue to get rate increases and the rate increases increase also in frequency, you're going to start to see some pressure on those deposit betas. It's just inevitable, and it's going to happen. Hasn't happened yet."

He added: "I'd say corporate betas have moved up certainly more than consumer betas and that's been consistent at least for the last year. So, you have a mixed component in the beta. Not every beta is the same."

5) Banks Are Mostly Insulated From a Recent Surge in Money-Market Rates; That's Not the Case for Commercial Borrowers Whose Interest Payments Are Tethered to the Rates.

Money-market rates - as measured by the three-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor - have spiked in recent months as Trump's tax cuts force the U.S. government to borrow more money to plug the widening deficit. The trend has led to a bigger supply of Treasury bills coming to market, forcing the government to pay higher yields to attract additional buyers.

Being in the middle of the financial system as both a borrower and lender of funds, banks' exposure to Libor rates is partly hedged.

"Examples of assets that we price off Libor would be the commercial banking loans and, obviously, unhedged or hedged long-term debt on the liability side," JPMorgan's Lake said on the company's conference call Friday. "If you look sort of net across the assets and liabilities sides, they materially offset."

He speaks with Bloomberg's Julia Chatterley on "What'd You Miss?"As President Donald Trump threatens to launch missile strikes in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack, and continues his harsh tone against Russia, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen’s proxy war continue to mount.

These key geopolitical developments have placed tremendous upward pressure on global oil prices, but there is another take away that is often being glossed over in energy news – this tension also has a significant impact on global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices.

How we got here

Trump said on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7. He also chastised Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Yet, on Thursday, Trump back-peddled, stating on Twitter: “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!”

Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our “Thank you America?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2018





Also, on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia faced what the Associated Press (AP) called a flurry of attempted attacks by Yemeni rebels. Saudi Arabia’s defense forces said they intercepted missiles that targeted key infrastructure in Riyadh and another city, and drones targeting an airport and an Aramco oil facility in the country’s south.

Impact on LNG

Correspondingly, Asian LNG prices this week rose by 25 cents from last week to $7.25/MMBtu, despite falling demand due to the onset of spring in the northern hemisphere. Historically, prices drop in the warmer weather months as demand for the super cooled fuel recedes.

For example, this past winter as China ramped up gas demand as part Beijing’s mandate to replace dirtier burning coal needed for power generation with gas, LNG prices breached the $11/MMBtu mark, the highest in three years. However, almost on cue, gas prices have dropped nearly 40 percent since those January highs due to warmer temperatures.

Oil price linkage

In Asia, most natural gas is imported as LNG, while the price is indexed to crude oil on a long-term contractual basis, though there has been an increase in spot and short-term trading in recent years. Consequently, geopolitical pressure on oil prices also impacts LNG prices.

The Asia Pacific market accounts for around three-quarters of global LNG trade and one-third of global natural gas trade. Moreover, increased gas and LNG demand growth in Asia will largely be driven by China.

Since there is currently no globally integrated market for natural gas, pricing mechanisms vary by regional market. Internationally traded natural gas has also been largely indexed to crude oil prices such as North Sea Brent or Japan customs-cleared crude (JCC) because of the liquidity and transparency of crude oil prices and the substitutability of natural gas and petroleum products in certain markets.

Related: Are Oil Markets Tightening Too Fast?

The possibility of higher LNG prices due to its oil price indexation and geopolitical risk could prove a boon for LNG projects outside the U.S., especially those that still need to sign long-term supply agreements to reach the all-important final investment decision (FID) to move forward. U.S. projects, for their part, offer Henry Hub-linked LNG pricing.

More geopolitical pressure on prices

Reuters, citing traders, said the LNG price gain this week was due to rising oil prices, as Brent crude futures hit their highest level since late-2014.

“Oil is by far the world’s biggest energy market. It dictates the direction for most other commodities,” said one trader. “It is particularly important for gas and LNG as many supply contracts are priced off crude.”

Global oil prices held steady on Friday but remained close to recent highs. Global benchmark Brent crude settled at $72.58 a barrel, up 56 cents by the end of the session, while U.S. benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 32 cents to $67.39. Prices for both climbed in post-settlement trading.

Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP, said “it does look like there's further upside ahead. People are still nervous about what's going to happen in Syria ... nothing was solved overnight."

More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The market appears to be painting JPMorgan (JPM) with the same brush as Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) after their quarterly releases, but the fact is that JPMorgan’s report represented all around strength and offers useful read-throughs for what to expect from pure-play investment banks, trust banks and regional operators in the coming days.



It isn’t hard to appreciate the market’s negative reaction to the Wells and Citi reports, but the post-release weakness in JPMorgan shares is likely nothing more than a sell-the-news type of mindset. There is likely a comparability ground for the market’s lack of appreciation for these results as well. Two new accounting rules took effect this quarter, one dealing with revenue recognition on the asset management side and the other dealing with the valuation of ‘hard-to-price’ securities on the balance sheets. The earnings releases specify the impact of these rule changes, but they add to the ‘noise’ around these results.



Wells Fargo didn’t seem to benefit much from higher interest rates as rival JPMorgan did, likely indicating that the beleaguered bank had the wrong type of interest rate hedges in place. The bank is in the process of concluding a regulatory settlement that will require a restatement of today’s results in the coming days, but management wasn’t able to shed any more light on that issue beyond indicating that more details should be available in the 10Q. As such, it’s hard to read too much into Wells’ Q1 report as it will undergo a restatement in the coming days



We recently made a contrarian call on Wells by adding it to the Zacks Focus List, our core thesis being that worst was already priced in the stock and the market will slowly be coming around to appreciating this fact. The internals of the Wells report indicate that the estimate revisions trend for the current and coming quarters will likely be negative, in contrast to what can reasonably be expected for JPMorgan and Citi, which will keep the stock under pressure. This means that our Focus List call on Wells may have been premature, with the stock’s underperformance relative to its peers likely to persist a lot longer than we envisaged.



The chart below shows the year-to-date performance comparison Citi, JPMorgan, Wells and the S&P 500 index.

Wells’ net interest margin, the difference between what it pays depositors and what it charges borrowers, was flat from the preceding quarter and down from the year-earlier level. Growth in the bank’s loan portfolio and expenses also compare unfavorably with its peers. Wells’ loan portfolio was down from the year-earlier level while the same at Citi and JPMorgan were up +7% and 8%, respectively.



Citi’s results failed to impress as well, with the bank’s trading business, particularly the fixed income desk, failed to fully capitalize on the all-around volatility in Q1. Unlike JPMorgan’s +8% revenue growth in the fixed income, currencies and commodities or FICC business, Citi’s FICC revenue was down -7% in Q1.



Finance Sector Scorecard (as of Friday, April 13th)



We now have Q1 results from 5 of the 98 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind however that these 5 companies account for 23.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the index.



Total earnings for these 5 Finance companies are up +20.4% from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenue growth, with 100% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context.

Story Continues

As you can see in the chart above, the sector’s growth picture is materially tracking above what we have been seeing in recent years, reflecting the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and more ‘normal’ capital markets activity. The right-hand side chart shows that earnings surprises are very numerous, but keep in mind that we are talking about 5 earnings reports at this stage.



For the quarter as a whole, total Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This would follow +0.6% earnings growth in 2017 Q4 on +4% higher revenues.



The sector’s earnings growth momentum is expected to continue in the coming quarters as well, as the chart below shows.

Please note that the sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond isn’t a function of easy comparisons, but actual growth. You can see this in the dollar value of total sector earnings in the chart below.

The table below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings growth expectations at the medium-industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding four periods.

Please note that the Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Bank of America and others are part, accounts for roughly 45% of the sector’s total earnings (insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor, accounting for about 25% of the total).



Driving this improved earnings picture for the banks and other finance companies is the combination of lower taxes and higher interest rates.



Expectations for 2018 Q1 As a Whole



The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue this reporting cycle as well, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up +16.6% from the same period last year on +7.5% higher revenues. This would follow the +13.4% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years.



There were two aspects of the preceding earning season that really stood out and put that reporting cycle in a category of its own; we will be looking to what extent these two aspect s get repeated this earnings season. These two standout features of the 2017 Q4 earnings season were the very strong momentum on the revenue front and impressive turnaround on the estimate revisions front.



The revenue momentum likely reflected a combination of the synchronized global growth environment and a favorable foreign exchange backdrop. With both of those factors still very much in play in Q1 as well, we can reasonably expect to see the revenue momentum trend continue this earnings season as well.



The story about trends in 2018 Q1 estimate revisions is better told by the chart below.

What this chart shows is that earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1 moved up significantly since mid-December 2017. This represented a major trend shift relative to what we have been seeing over the last many years when estimates would actually be moving in the opposite direction. To be fair, the revisions trend had stabilized in the preceding quarters as well, with estimates for 2017 Q4 essentially remaining unchanged in the three months ahead of the start of that reporting cycle.



A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts, but that isn’t the only reason, as you can see in the revisions trend for revenues in the chart below.

We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond. Estimates for Q2 went up as well, as they did for the following quarters, when the same was happening to 2018 Q1 estimates. As of today, total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +17.7% from the same period the year before on +7.2% higher revenues.



The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters.

As you can imagine, expectations for full-year 2018 are for an impressive showing, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be +17.8% from the year-earlier level on +5.2% higher revenues. If achieved, this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.



The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.

Standout Sectors



As you can see, the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +59.4% from the year-earlier period on +16.1% higher revenues. But growth for the quarter would still be in double-digits even on an ex-Energy basis (last row in the table above).



What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn’t the Energy sector, but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 out of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance.



For the Technology sector, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +20.7% on +11.4% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s impressive +24.2% earnings growth on +11.1% higher revenue growth.



The Finance sector, which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +22.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.



Driving the Finance sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment. Finance sector’s earnings were only up +1.2% in full-year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that, but are on expected to be up an impressive +25.1% in full-year 2018.



The Technology sector, on the other hand, has already been on stronger ground, with full-year 2017 earnings for the sector up +15.8% and expected to be up +17.3% in 2018. The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts, with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends. On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space.



Please note that Technology and Finance aren’t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S&P 500 index; these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index’s total profitability, bringing in more than 40% of the index’s total earnings this year. The Energy sector’s outlook has improved, but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two. The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5% of the index’s total earnings this year.



Reporting Calendar

As you can see in the chart above, the reporting cycle is ramping up with more than 150 companies reporting results, including 56 S&P 500 members. While the bulk of this week’s reports are dominated by the Finance sector, we have a number of leading players from other sectors reporting results already. The major non-financial reports on deck to report results this week include Netflix (NFLX) on Monday, IBM (IBM) on Tuesday, and Schlumberger (SLB) and GE (GE) on Friday.

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?



Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.



With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.



It's not the one you think.

About 90% of Americans have seen a bump in take-home pay since the new tax law went into effect at the beginning of February.

Millennials are more inclined to put the extra cash toward savings, investing, and paying down debt, according to a Bank of America survey.

Gen X is more likely to use the additional income for day-to-day spending.

What would you do if you suddenly had more money in your pocket?

If you're a millennial, the answer may likely be "save it."

The tax bill signed by President Trump back in December resulted in a bump in take-home pay for about 90% of Americans beginning in February, according to the IRS.

With more money in their pockets, workers are mostly putting it toward savings or paying down debt, according to a Bank of America survey of about 1,200 employed Americans.

But there's a difference between the behaviors of Gen X and millennials that suggests "a greater sense of responsibility than often credited" to the latter.

A higher share of millennials, respondents between the ages of 22 and 37, reported saving (20%), investing (17%), or paying down debt (8%) with their tax reform windfall, while more Gen Xers than millennials said they were using the money for day-to-day spending (11% versus 8%).

Interestingly, about 20% of millennial and Gen X respondents said they didn't get a tax cut, but Bank of America assumes some people simply didn't notice the difference, or it was delayed.

Business Insider previously calculated how the change in tax brackets effects single, childless workers who are paid every other week (26 paychecks a year). The new tax law resulted in increases ranging from $7.78 per paycheck for a worker earning $20,000 a year, to $118.45 per paycheck for someone earning $269,600 a year.

The amounts were based on new guidelines released in January by the IRS, known as tax-withholding tables, that help employers calculate how much to take out of employees' paychecks in taxes.

In many ways, Gen X is worse off financially than millennials; their saving and spending habits, and lack of retirement planning are "concerning." Nonmortgage debt has increased for Gen Xers, from an average $20,000 in 2014 to $23,000 in 2017, according to a 2017 report from Allianz Life Insurance Company.

The same report revealed 41% of millennials contribute to savings each month, compared to 36% of Gen Xers. Incredibly, the two generations both have about $35,000 saved for retirement, despite at most a 15-year age difference.

DON'T MISS: Americans don't spend enough on their credit cards to get the travel rewards they expected — here's how to make sure you don't miss outApple’s past several days have been marked by two things: new iPhone and talk of HomePod sales disappointing.

The tech giant on Monday unveiled the new red iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The handset is part of a (PRODUCT)RED lineup of devices from Apple that makes donations to fight AIDS. But while Apple was trying to celebrate that release, a Bloomberg report surfaced, saying the company has been disappointed by HomePod smart speaker sales and has cut its forecasts. To pile on, a judge this week awarded a long-time Apple patent foe, VirnetX, a $502 million cash windfall.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter

Needless to say, it wasn’t the best of weeks for Apple. But read on to learn more about some of the tech giant’s biggest news from the past week:

This is Fortune’s latest weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news. Here’s last week’s roundup.

Apple this week released the new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The handsets come with a red color finish and have the same internal components as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models Apple released last year. Since they’re (PRODUCT)RED iPhones, Apple donates a portion of the proceeds to fight AIDS. In a statement this week, Apple said that it’s donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund, an organization that works to eradicate AIDS, through its (PRODUCT)RED sales. In addition to iPhones, Apple sells (PRODUCT)RED wireless headphones, iPod Touch, and watchbands for its Apple Watch. The HomePod smart speaker Apple released earlier this year is proving to be far less appealing to consumers than the company had hoped, according to a report this week from Bloomberg. The news outlet, which cited sources who claim to have knowledge of Apple’s sales, reported that Apple has reduced its sales forecast on HomePod. The report also said that HomePod sales are far behind those of its competitors, Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple, however, has not announced actual HomePod sales figures. A federal judge this week ordered Apple to pay $502 million in damages to security company VirnetX for allegedly violating four patents VirnetX owns. The battle between the companies, which has nearly spanned a decade, centers on whether Apple’s FaceTime, iMessage, and VPN On Demand services violate communications-related patents owned by VirnetX. This isn’t the end, however: a patent court recently ruled that the four patents are invalid and could help Apple overturn the damages ruling and ultimately win the case if the invalidity decision is upheld. A report out of Korea this week said the iPhone maker could face sanctions over its business dealings with carriers in that country. According to the report from the Korea Herald, Apple has required its Korean carrier partners to advertise the iPhone and perform repairs on broken handsets at their own cost—a possible violation of local laws. The Korean Federal Trade Commission is reportedly deciding whether to fine Apple for those alleged practices. Apple did not respond to a Fortune request for comment on the report this week. Apple said on Monday that its worldwide business is now 100% powered by clean energy, up from 96% of all of its facilities across 43 countries reporting full clean energy in 2017. Apple added that nine of its manufacturing partners have also agreed to power facilities that produce the company’s products on clean energy, bringing that total number to 23 partners.

One more thing…Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has joined the #DeleteFacebook movement to protest the world’s largest social network’s collection of user data and its apparent dissemination to third-parties. The news came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress over his company’s ongoing scandal.Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, Apple’s HomePod doesn’t seem to be resonating with consumers. Following up on a pair of reports claiming that HomePod sales have been lackluster, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on Friday issued a new research note (via MacRumors) echoing the notion that the HomePod, to be blunt, simply isn’t selling well.

While some of the earlier and more optimistic projections suggested that HomePod sales for 2018 might be as high as 10 million units, Kuo anticipates that Apple, by the time 2018 draws to a close, may see HomePod sales fall somewhere in the 2 million range. While it’s still far too early to call the HomePod a flop, Apple’s smart speaker certainly hasn’t gotten off to a strong start in the marketplace.

Part of the problem is that the HomePod is simply an expensive smart speaker. Priced at $349, it’s significantly pricier than competing devices from the likes of Google and Amazon. And though the HomePod delivers unparalleled sound quality, it’s perhaps possible that everyday users simply aren’t interested in paying a premium for the HomePod when they find the audio quality on a device like the Amazon Echo to be ‘good enough.’

Additionally, it’s no secret that Siri’s capabilities on the HomePod aren’t even close to matching what rival intelligent assistants can pull off. Not only that, the version of Siri that ships with the HomePod is stunted relative to the Siri experience on the iPhone.

Kuo’s note reads in part:

However, we note that for most users worldwide, Siri is not a must-have function, and Apple has not yet become a leading brand in the AI voice assistant market. We also note that HomePod has not added support for new languages in the device since launch, suggesting Apple is facing challenges in AI/voice assistant development spanning the globe; this will cap the shipments momentum of HomePod.

In light of poor sales, Kuo corroborates previous reports claiming that Apple is mulling over a more affordable HomePod device. While details remain hazy, previous reports have claimed that Apple later this year may release a HomePod somewhere in the $150 range, a price point that would instantly make the device far more competitive with rival products. It remains unclear, though, what a more affordable HomePod model would bring to the table in terms of features. Either way, if Apple is serious about competing in the smart speaker market, it’s starting to become apparent that the company will have to do something to shake things up lest it fall too far behind.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold and oil will extend their gains on Monday, albeit modestly, when markets open for the first time since Western powers launched a missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to suffer big losses unless the West strikes again or Russia retaliates.

"The news flow is actually better than what it looked like at one point during last week as the strike was surgical, followed by a pullback. Reports show a lot of care was taken not to hit Russian targets, which is a good sign and the market should take heart from that," said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier investment managers in London.

Gold has benefited in recent days as a safe-haven asset amid a U.S.-China trade dispute and the escalating conflict in Syria, which also pushed oil above $70 per barrel due to concerns about a spike in Middle Eastern tensions.

World stocks wobbled last week but still ended with the best weekly gain in over a month, as investors await potentially healthy U.S. company earnings.

Despite heightened geopolitical risks, the impact on so-called safe-haven assets has been short-lived and modest. While the yen rose initially on fears of a Syrian strike, it ended near seven-week lows to the dollar last week.

On Saturday, U.S., French and British missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria's chemical weapons program in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago, although the assault appeared unlikely to halt Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's progress in the seven-year-old civil war.

For map of Syrian strikes, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2EKgAMN

The bombing, denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression, was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his powerful ally Russia.

But the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said gold was poised to gain on Monday but the rally wouldn't be very steep: "The focus will be on the counter-reaction from Russia."

Gold, often used as a store of value in times of political and economic uncertainty, could rally towards $1,400 per ounce after two consecutive weeks of gains.

"If we do break above $1,365, that next week we would be very bullish," said Aslam.

Tokyo will be the first major market to open on Monday and the yen will likely strengthen to the dollar, but not beyond 106.50, said Itsuo Toshima, market analyst at Toshima & Associates adding that he didn't expect stocks traders to make sharp moves.

"The first attack was within expectations and was already priced in the market ... However, if there is a second round of strikes, that is not in line with expectations. So that should prompt a sharp risk-off move in markets," he added.

Frank Benzimra, head of global markets for Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking, said stocks would plunge only in case of new strikes by Western powers.

In case of such an escalation, oil would rally further, the yen would spike and Japan's domestic defensive stocks would outperform international stocks.

"For the stress on Asia equity markets to be sustainable, we would need to have oil prices spiking to such a level that fundamental concerns, i.e. higher inflation and risks on growth, return to the market," he said.

Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects said that despite Middle Eastern tensions and looming new U.S. sanctions on Iran, oil has outperformed most expectations this year and may have rallied too far too fast.

"We are likely to get a sell-off this week as the extent of the Syrian strikes have been muted and, in general, calmer nerves prevail in Washington," she said.

Oil traders had locked in long positions ahead of the weekend, in anticipation of potential strikes, sending both West Texas Intermediate <CLc1> and global benchmark Brent <LCOc1> crude futures to their highest since 2014.

Moscow (Russia) (AFP) - New Western air strikes in Syria would provoke "chaos" in international relations, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on Sunday.

Speaking to Rouhani by telephone the day after US-led strikes on suspected chemical weapons facilities, Putin said "if such actions, carried out in violation of the United Nations Charter, are repeated, that would inevitably provoke chaos in international relations," according to a statement from the Kremlin.

The two leaders "found that this illegal action seriously damaged the prospects of a political settlement in Syria," the statement said.

The United States, France and Britain on Saturday launched strikes against Bashar al-Assad's government a week after an alleged chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma, just east of the capital Damascus.

Putin denounced on Saturday "with the utmost firmness" the strikes which he described as "an act of aggression against a sovereign state which is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism".

"There is every reason to believe that after the U.S. strikes on Syria, the Americans will be eager to move to a strategic dialogue," Interfax news agency quoted Vladimir Ermakov, head of the foreign ministry's department for non-proliferation and arms control, as saying.

"You cannot say the Americans ... do not demonstrate a desire to lead a strategic dialogue," he said. "In the U.S. administration there are specific people who it is possible to talk with."

Despite finishing last week with gains, the Dow and the S&P 500 still remain in the red for the year with investors continuing to find themselves at the mercy of the volatile political news cycle.

“While volatility remains alive and well, the market managed to have a good showing [last] week,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group on Friday. “While it’s nice to see, it’s important to remember that conditions still have a ways to go before stabilizing.”

Stocks on Friday closed in the red and reacted negatively to an NBC News report which suggested President Donald Trump — who called former FBI director Jim Comey an “untruthful slime ball” on Friday — will likely fire Rod Rosenstein.

Rosenstein is the deputy Attorney General leading the Russia probe after AG Jeff Sessions recused himself. This has also led many in markets to speculate that Trump could also move to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. As of Sunday morning, both men remained in their roles.

And this political drama followed this week’s testimony from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who faced two days of questions on Capitol Hill this week. Judging by the action in Facebook shares, however, investors appear undeterred by any threats of regulatory action out of Washington, as the stock had its best day since in almost two years on Tuesday and gained 4.5% for the week.

The economic data calendar will be relatively tame, though Monday’s report on retail sales for the month of March will be closely watched.

The stock market is still a mess

This past week, the major U.S. indexes finished with gains of about 1%. But the Dow and the S&P 500 failed to recoup their year-to-date losses after having made a run at getting back into positive territory for the year earlier in the week. And the longer markets continue in this period of higher volatility while failing to make new highs, the more skeptical investors are likely to become about the health of the bull market.

In a note earlier in the week, Credit Suisse analysts said the outflows from passive funds investing in the U.S. stock market over the last two months are the highest since 2008. The volatility seen in early February and which has continued is clearly spooking investors.

Meanwhile, the final three days of this past trading week were the three lowest volume days of the year, signaling a decreased appetite for new money coming into the stock market, especially as many corporations are currently unable to make new discretionary repurchases of their own stock.

On Tuesday of this past week, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, cut her year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 2,890 from 3,000. “The bull is limping,” Calvasina said, “but still moving forward.” Wall Street strategists are clearly growing skeptical that the double-digit returns so many had called for in 2018 will materialized, but are not yet ready to call for outright declines in the market.By Kate Holton

LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, who built WPP into the world's biggest advertising agency through 33 years of dealmaking, quit on Saturday after an allegation of personal misconduct.

The departure of the CEO who built a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies with 200,000 staff in 112 countries leaves WPP without a boss at a pivotal time for the industry and when the group is under great strain.

WPP stunned the market last week when it said it had appointed lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sorrell. He denied the allegations but in a letter to WPP staff published late on Saturday he said the "current disruption" was "putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business".

He said he had decided that "in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside".

Chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman until a new chief executive is found, while Mark Read, a WPP digital executive, and Andrew Scott, chief operating officer, Europe, have been appointed as joint chief operating officers.

Read, who previously sat on WPP's main board, is well regarded in the industry while Scott was involved in its acquisition strategy and was not involved with clients.

The company will consider internal and external candidates for the top job in a process that could take several months.

"Obviously I am sad to leave WPP after 33 years," Sorrell said in a statement. "It has been a passion, focus and source of energy for so long. However, I believe it is in the best interests of the business if I step down now."

WPP said the investigation, which regarded financial impropriety, had concluded. It made no further comment but repeated a previous statement that the allegation did not involve amounts that were material to the company.

A source close to Sorrell said he had been unhappy with how the investigation was handled, leaving him uncertain whether he could work with the board again.

Analysts have speculated that the sprawling group, which was being restructured after a year of lower spending from some clients, could now sell off some assets if led by different management.





PASSION AND FOCUS

The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into one of Britain's biggest companies by three decades of relentless dealmaking. He is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in the country.

In his time the group expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers, market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury.

Present in 112 countries, WPP serves clients including Ford, Unilever, P&G and a string of major corporations around the world.

It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom, Publicis and IPG in the years that followed the financial crisis as the group pitched aggressively for new work. But it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in spending from consumer goods groups Unilever and P&G, and the loss of some big accounts.

The migration of advertising online and the encroachment into market research of consultancies such as Accenture have compounded the pressures. Its shares are down around 30 percent this year.

The company said Sorrell would be available to assist with the transition, and the man synonymous with the British marketing group told the staff they would come through this difficult time.

"As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that," Sorrell said. "Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now back to the future."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Saturday called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council as Moscow said it would consider supplying S-300 missile systems to Syria following U.S.-led strikes.

"Russia convenes an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss aggressive actions of the U.S. and its allies," President Vladimir Putin said in a statement published on the Kremlin website.

"The current escalation of the situation around Syria has a devastating impact on the whole system of international relations," he added.

U.S., British and French forces pounded Syria with more than 100 missiles early on Saturday in response to a poison gas attack that killed dozens of people last week, in the biggest intervention by Western powers against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Putin said the U.S. actions in Syria made the humanitarian catastrophe worse and caused pain for civilians.

"Russia in the most serious way condemns the attack on Syria where Russian military servicemen help the legitimate government to fight terrorism," Putin said.

MISSILES FOR SYRIA

Moscow may consider supplying S-300 surface to-air missile systems to Syria and "other countries", Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoi told a televised briefing on Saturday.

Russia had "refused" supplying those missiles to Syria a few years ago, he added, "taking into account the pressing request of some of our Western partners".

Following the U.S.-led strikes, however, "we consider it possible to return to examination of this issue not only in regard to Syria but to other countries as well," Rudskoi said.

Syria's air defence system, which mostly consists of systems made in the Soviet Union, has intercepted 71 of the missiles fired on Saturday by the U.S., British and French forces, he added.

"In the past year and a half Russia has fully restored Syria's air defence system and continues to further upgrade it," Rudskoi said.

The GLD ETF represents fractional, undivided beneficial ownership interests in a trust whose sole assets are gold bullion on and, from time to time, cash. So the GLD ETF is one step removed from actually holding gold in your own vault. The question is whether or not you should own the GLD ETF and, if so, under what parameters?

The Problem With Gold

The truth is that precious metals don’t really make for a very good long-term investment. Psychology plays a very big part in the price of gold at any particular moment, as well as demand for gold in various parts of industry.

Gold has traditionally been seen as a hedge against inflation. The inflation-adjusted price of gold was $2,200 per ounce in 1979 and it fell to just under $400/ounce in 2000. So, I suppose you could say it was a hedge against inflation.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, the sad truth is that the price of gold went nowhere from 1915 to 1975. One might even argue that it went nowhere all the way through 2005. I suppose it’s all well and good that, adjusting for inflation, gold held its value for almost an entire century. The problem is that nobody holds gold buillon for 90 years. As a long-term investment, then, the GLD ETF is not going to deliver growth.

That is the big difference between precious metals and stocks. Over time the stock market has a positive bias. Going back to the stock market’s earliest days, and tracking it to today, the markets have obviously gone significantly higher. That is because stock prices tend to follow earnings. Earnings tend to rise over time because economies tend to grow over time. Economies tend to grow over time because, as opposed to what misinformed ideological wonks want you to believe, wealth is in fact created from nothing. Stocks therefore have a positive expectation over time. A Gold ETF does not. And while were talking about that, gambling at the casino has a negative expectation over time. That’s why you want to invest in casino stocks rather than play casino games.

The Argument for Gold

So does GLD have any place in your portfolio?

I’m sure readers who know about my fondness for non-correlated investments, meaning investments that do not track with the overall market over time, would think that precious metals do have a place in a long-term diversified portfolio. In point of fact, my investment advisory newsletter, The Liberty Portfolio, does not have and does not intend to have any kind of precious metal holdings. That’s because the point of non-correlated investments, and The Liberty Portfolio, is to reduce overall volatility in the portfolio. Gold and precious metals tend to have a great deal of volatility.

The way to play gold, in my opinion, is to trade it. But you cannot just trade willy-nilly. Technical analysis is your friend when it comes to trading gold, but because psychological sentiment is all over the place, you will frequently find that technical analysis is actually very little help.

The only real technical analysis that is going to help you is when gold is trading at extreme valuations on either end. If gold flies back up over $1,800/ounce, that would be a time to short. If gold falls below $1000, that’s fairly likely an opportunity to go long. In both cases, however, I would set stop losses of 7 to 10%.

Otherwise, I would avoid GLD altogether.

The post Why Gold Does Not Belong in Your Portfolio appeared first on InvestorPlace.It’s been a rough road for Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI). For many years, before the parent company consolidated all of its elements into a single entity, the master limited partnership was considered a very reliable dividend stock. Kinder Morgan LP was constantly referred to as the blue-chip of pipeline master limited partnership stocks.

Then the bottom fell out of the oil market. Prices plunged, and with them the earnings of virtually every energy-based company. As I’ve often warned investors, a stock can have a very reliable dividend, but no matter how high that dividend is, it will mean nothing if the stock loses 60% of its value.

The Troubles at Kinder Morgan Inc

KMI stock has had its ups and down since then. KMI stock generates operating income, as well as net income. The last two years, KMI stock has generated positive free cash flow, although that was not the case in 2015.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

However, just as things seemed to be on the upswing for KMI stock, a very bizarre thing happened up in Canada. The company has been working on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, a $6 billion infrastructure work that has received strong opposition from the current government in British Columbia, as well as protesters on the ground.

Last autumn, KMI stock spun off its Canadian subsidiary, into Kinder Morgan Canada Limited (OTCBB:KMLGF), raising $1.3 billion for the sole purpose of funding the pipeline expansion in Canada. Well, right before the IPO finished, Canada’s new Democratic Party allied with the Green party, with the goal of killing the expansion project.

Kinder Morgan has gone through the entire process, from regulatory to environmental and more, in order for the project to go through. However, late last week, KMI management has decided to pull the plug, as opposition to the pipeline reached peak shrillness.

Pipeline Problems

As usual, it is the misguided stance of environmental groups that get in the way of a necessary pipeline project. The Trans-Mountain expansion project would simply parallel the nearly 700-mile existing pipeline, built back in 1953, and is the only West Coast link for Western Canadian oil. The capacity for transport would nearly triple to 900,000 barrels per day. The nixing of the pipeline, in turn, disrupts oil shipping companies. The shippers made commitments of up to 20 years that would add 80% of the capacity.

Now, let’s not kid ourselves. The move by Kinder Morgan is political, to put pressure on the provincial government. This, in turn, shifts the focus over to the federal government. The Canadian federal government does not want to send a message that Canada is unfriendly to business, particularly energy interests. Canada’s natural resources minister offered to possibly invest in the KMI pipeline project “if it would bring certainty” to the project.

Prime Minister Trudeau is in a bit of a pickle, because he approved the expansion himself in 2016.

Bottom Line on KMI Stock

Either way, I think this will work out okay for Kinder Morgan stock owners. I think the project will start back up again. Either the federal government will invest alongside KMI stock management, effectively insulating the project from provincial politics, or the federal government may simply buy out the entire project and partner with the province of Ottawa, which has expressed interest in the project.

Your IRS tax refund will typically be available within 21 days if you file electronically.

Filing taxes electronically with direct deposit ensures the refund gets to your bank account quicker, the IRS says.

The IRS has resources to help you file your taxes and get your refund quickly.



Most people dread filing their taxes — but nearly everyone is hoping for a refund. Procrastinators have a couple of extra days to file their return this year, as Tax Day falls on April 17 instead of the standard April 15.

The Internal Revenue Service reports that about 83% of tax returns result in refunds. If you're one of the lucky ones who can expect to get money back this year, you may be wondering exactly when you will receive your refund.

The short answer is almost certainly within three weeks of when you file your taxes. But there are ways to get it sooner.

Filing online is the quickest way to get your tax refund. Using snail mail will get the job done but take more time.

For a quicker refund, the IRS suggests you e-file and request your refund via direct deposit, the chosen method for most taxpayers. The IRS says direct deposit — which the government also uses for Social Security and Veterans Affairs payments — is "simple, safe, and secure."

If you filed electronically, you should receive a refund within 21 days. The IRS updates its system daily, usually overnight.

The traditional paper-and-pencil option means, in most cases, your refund will arrive within six weeks of of filing. If it doesn't, an error or incompletion may be holding up the process.

Taxpayers can check the status of their tax refund using the IRS's return-tracking service within 24 hours of filing your tax return online — but to do so, you'll need three things:

Your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.

Your filing status.

The exact refund amount.

The IRS also says the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit cannot be issued until mid-February as a means to protect against identity theft and tax fraud. Those refunds will be ready as soon as February 27.

The new Republican tax law will not change the tax-filing process this year — it goes into effect for income earned in 2018, meaning you'll see the effects when you file your taxes next year.

DON'T MISS: Taxpayers will get an extra couple of days before filing their taxes next year — here's when tax day is in 2018Your accountant or tax software says you’re getting a $1,000 refund on your taxes. But when the check arrives, it’s only $250. What gives? That’s $750 short of your rightful $1,000.

When you go check online through the IRS’ Where’s My Refund tool, you see a notification. Your tax return has just been “offset.” Due to an outstanding debt that you forgot about or perhaps an overdue bill that has accrued interest and penalties, the IRS has decided to offset your tax return. This is called a tax return offset.

Click to read more about why you shouldn’t assume you’re getting a tax refund.

This type of scenario can happen to almost anyone who has overdue debts. If you owe a federal or state debt, you can see your federal payments taken to repay the debt and fees associated with it. You aren’t without options. There are ways to prepare yourself.

Who Can Offset Your Tax Return?

When it comes to offsetting your tax return, those making the request must go through the IRS. It is then up to the IRS if they want to grant the request. This basically means anyone can go after your tax return. Federal agencies have a higher chance of being successful at offsetting your tax return. Collection agencies for credit card companies have virtually no chance.

Here’s a list of the most common entities that are likely to offset your tax return:

– IRS

– Federal agencies (student loans, Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] loans, penalties or fines to these agencies)

– State taxes

– Owed child support

– Unemployment compensation

In the case of child support, Emily Beach said a tax offset generally “kicks in if you owe more than $150 in state-assigned tax support payments or more than $500 in child support payments to an individual, such as your child’s custodial parent.”

In the case of non-federal collection agencies trying to offset your tax return, there’s very little chance this will ever happen. The IRS website provides more detail on how the IRS collects taxes owed through tax returns: People who have slipped up on their student loan or child support payments had their refund status money taken because of the collection agencies requesting it from the IRS. The IRS as an entity does not collect on debts except for taxes owed to them.

Spousal Debt

The debt of your spouse can be a factor in your tax return being offset if you are married and filing jointly. Debts that can be collected are the same government debts mentioned above. If the debt is exclusively that of your spouse, you can file Form 8379 to claim a portion of the tax return for you as an individual. This is also called “Injured Spouse.”

There is another term called “Innocent Spouse,” which is relief from tax liabilities including interest and penalties. You can read about both on the IRS website.

There are cases when you might consider filing separately due to debt owed by one spouse and not the other.

This is especially true if you’re dealing with student loan debt. If you’re in default on your student loans and see your tax return garnished, you might consider filing separately. This also allows you to potentially get a lower repayment plan amount if you’re on Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

Learn more here about the implications of filing separately for student loans.

What Rights Do You Have?

To avoid being blindsided by a tax return offset, there are a few things you can do. First is to wait for a notice from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS), which is part of the Department of the Treasury, and issues refunds and tracks offsets. The BFS will have the following in its notice:

– Original refund amount

– Your refund offset amount

– Agency receiving the payment

– Address and telephone number of the agency

If you don’t receive the above notice, you can call the BFS directly. Once you call them, listen to the message and do as instructed. You’ll enter your Social Security number, and it will check to see if there is a tax offset against you. If there is, write down any information provided so that you can call and get additional information. The database is updated consistently, so you can call and check as often as you’d like.

You can also check your credit report and see if there are any debts in default listed.

Story ContinuesFILE - In this Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017 file photo, Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, visits the New York Stock Exchange in New York.

LONDON (AP) -- Martin Sorrell is stepping down as chief executive of WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, following allegations of personal misconduct.

Sorrell, who built WPP into a global brand during his 33 years at the helm, had been accused of misusing company assets. He has denied any wrongdoing.

Sorrell resigned Saturday night as WPP announced that an investigation into the matter had concluded, with the firm saying only that "the allegation did not involve amounts that are material."

"As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business," Sorrell said in a statement to WPP staff. "That is why I have decided that, in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside."

Chairman Roberto Quarta will lead the company until a new chief executive has been chosen.

Sorrell is a titan of British business who was named the world's second-best performing CEO in 2017 by the Harvard Business Review. He took a U.K. manufacturer of wire baskets and built it into a worldwide provider of advertising, public relations and marketing services through a series of takeovers.

The acquisitions included the J. Walter Thompson Group, the Young & Rubicam Group and the Ogilvy Group.

He was richly compensated for his efforts.

Sorrell was the highest-paid CEO among FTSE 100 companies in both 2015 and 2016, according to a study released last year by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the High Pay Centre. He received 70.4 million pounds ($100.3 million) in salary, bonuses, incentive rewards, pension payments and other benefits in 2015, and 48.1 million pounds in 2016, the study found.

"If WPP does well, I do well," he told the Press Association in April 2016. "Most of my wealth, if not all of it, is and has been for the last 31 years tied up in the success of WPP. So if WPP does well, I do well, and others in the company do well. If we do badly, we suffer."By Kate Holton

LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell's sudden exit from WPP marks a shocking end to the career of a chief executive who through sheer force of personality made it the world's biggest advertising firm.

WPP said in early April it had appointed lawyers to investigate a whistleblower's allegation of personal misconduct against Sorrell, who over 33 years turned a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies present in 112 countries.

The 73-year-old said on Saturday he was standing down, departing at a crucial time for WPP which has seen its share price fall 30 percent this year due to lower client spending, contract losses and a growing threat from Google and Facebook.

"I shall miss all of you greatly," he wrote in an email to staff. "As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that."

WPP did not give any details of the allegation and Sorrell denied the charges, initially saying that he understood the need to investigate. However, when the matter made it into the Wall Street Journal he told friends he thought it was being used as a weapon to force him out, one source said.

A former rival chief executive and a current CEO told Reuters last week that the fact Sorrell was under investigation showed how the dynamic within WPP had changed.

"To me it's not actually about whether he did anything wrong but it's the fact that three years ago the board would not even have gone down this path," the former CEO said. "Martin was all powerful and WPP without Martin was not worth thinking about."

MAKING A NAME

The son of an electronics retailer who was educated at the University of Cambridge, Sorrell made his name as the finance director of the start-up British ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi.

He took center stage in 1985, buying a stake in a small manufacturing firm Wire and Plastic Products Plc to use it as a public vehicle to buy communications groups around the world.

Within a few years he had sealed a string of takeovers, snapping up such storied creative agencies as J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy before moving into the cash cow of media planning and buying by creating Group M. Market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury followed.

Known for a ferocious work ethic and microscopic attention to detail, Sorrell built up the group by pitching aggressively for work, often leading the charge himself and going above the heads of marketing officers to deal directly with their bosses.

The role meant Sorrell became an authority not just on advertising but on the global economy and an ever present voice on the media and at events such as Davos.

Respected by his peers, he was however shown little affection by them in the ego-driven ad business and was sometimes dismissed as a "beancounter" because of his financial rather than advertising background.

David Ogilvy famously referred to Sorrell as an "odious little jerk" when the WPP CEO sought to buy his company. The two ad men later made up and Sorrell signed off WPP's annual report that year as "OLJ".

"He is so brutally competitive," the former CEO said. "He is such a competitor and he can get so angry when he loses."

Many executives recount stories of the CEO taking contract losses personally, including one who told Reuters how Sorrell had shared an hour's car journey in complete silence after his rival mentioned an account he had recently won from WPP.

Sorrell sparred repeatedly with the long-time boss of French rival Publicis, Maurice Levy, and enjoyed pointing out to journalists the failings of his rivals.

His combative style earned respect from the senior staff who worked for him however. One New York-based executive told Reuters how, on a night out, senior executives would all email Sorrell at exactly the same time to see who he would respond to first.

"He has an astounding grasp of detail if you consider the scale of the enterprise," said another executive who knew Sorrell professionally for many decades. "It's practically a stage show."

The success also brought great wealth for the father of four, with the perma-tanned executive earning around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone due to a performance-linked bonus scheme that angered many shareholders.

LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, who built WPP into the world's biggest advertising agency through 33 years of dealmaking, quit on Saturday after an allegation of personal misconduct.

The departure of the CEO who built a two-man outfit into one of Britain's biggest companies with 200,000 staff in 112 countries leaves WPP without a boss at a pivotal time for the industry and when the group is under great strain.

WPP stunned the market last week when it said it had appointed lawyers to investigate alleged misconduct by Sorrell. He denied the allegations but in a letter to WPP staff published late on Saturday he said the "current disruption" was "putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business".

He said he had decided that "in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside".

Chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman until a new chief executive is found, while Mark Read, a WPP digital executive, and Andrew Scott, chief operating officer, Europe, have been appointed as joint chief operating officers.

Read, who previously sat on WPP's main board, is well regarded in the industry while Scott was involved in its acquisition strategy and was not involved with clients.

The company will consider internal and external candidates for the top job in a process that could take several months.

"Obviously I am sad to leave WPP after 33 years," Sorrell said in a statement. "It has been a passion, focus and source of energy for so long. However, I believe it is in the best interests of the business if I step down now."

WPP said the investigation, which regarded financial impropriety, had concluded. It made no further comment but repeated a previous statement that the allegation did not involve amounts that were material to the company.

A source close to Sorrell said he had been unhappy with how the investigation was handled, leaving him uncertain whether he could work with the board again.

Analysts have speculated that the sprawling group, which was being restructured after a year of lower spending from some clients, could now sell off some assets if led by different management.





PASSION AND FOCUS

The longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into one of Britain's biggest companies by three decades of relentless dealmaking. He is one of the most high profile, and best paid, executives in the country.

In his time the group expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers, market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury.

Present in 112 countries, WPP serves clients including Ford, Unilever, P&G and a string of major corporations around the world.

It largely outperformed its peers Omnicom, Publicis and IPG in the years that followed the financial crisis as the group pitched aggressively for new work. But it has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in spending from consumer goods groups Unilever and P&G, and the loss of some big accounts.

The migration of advertising online and the encroachment into market research of consultancies such as Accenture have compounded the pressures. Its shares are down around 30 percent this year.

The company said Sorrell would be available to assist with the transition, and the man synonymous with the British marketing group told the staff they would come through this difficult time.

"As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that," Sorrell said. "Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now back to the future."

You can throw all the 2 percent days and all the Trump tweets you want at investors. They’re not quitting stocks. At least not yet.

During a placid week for equities, enthusiasm for the market picked up. Investors poured $5.6 billion of fresh cash into mutual funds at the start of April, the fourth-most in a decade, while exchange-traded funds stemmed the worst outflows since the financial crisis. Meanwhile, users of day-trading securities that pay two or three times the S&P 500 Index’s return remained convinced they can make money from all the jarring ups and downs.

Headlines surrounding President Donald Trump’s trade policy and Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony to Congress were little more than noise. Why not, when corporate America is kicking off what may be the best earnings season in seven years?

Sentiment is far from euphoric levels seen in late January after a two-month tumult wiped off $3 trillion of equity values. But there was little to indicate any permanent damage to the buy-the-dip mentality that has ruled markets for the last five years.

“We’re not looking for earnings to decline or the kind of falls that would lead to concerns that we’re entering a recession or a bear market,” said John Carey, a fund manager for Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “All the signs point to a strong economy,” he said. “The impulse to buy on dips is not quite so pronounced, but still alive.”

The S&P 500 rose 2 percent over past five days, with only one session experiencing moves of more than 1 percent. That’s in contrast with the previous two weeks, when the index swung that much in all but two days and rose or fell 2 percent or more three times. The Cboe Volatility Index dropped 19 percent over the week to the lowest level in a month.

Investors have warmed up to stocks, taking advantage of cheaper valuations as the earnings expansion remains on track and economic data has suggested worries over inflation was overblown. At 17 times forecast profit, the S&P 500 traded at the lowest multiple in two years.

ETFs focusing on U.S. equities attracted almost $9 billion of fresh money over the past week, reversing a quarter of the outflows seen over the last two months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

“People are starting to settle down,” John Iborg, a portfolio manager at QS Investors, which manages $22 billion, said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “They’re starting to get their senses about inflation expectations and how that might not necessarily be the biggest thing eating at equity risk right now.”

In the market’s most excitable corners, where traders use leveraged ETFs as a way to target short-term bets on up-and-down swings, conviction have been unshakable. Money has poured into securities that are long S&P 500 stocks and drained out of those that are short. Thanks to inflows, assets of leveraged long funds have kept growing this year in spite of falling stock prices. The market capitalization of bullish products has eclipsed that of inverse notes since November, with their ratio topping 2 in January for the first time ever.

Not only haven’t investors bailed, they’re headed back into stocks seen as more risky. Small-cap stocks have beaten their large-cap counterparts this month and companies that recently went public outperformed the S&P 500. Volatility has been sought with jumpy shares outpacing calm ones.

The risk-on behavior bodes well for equities, according to Jeff deGraaf, Renaissance Macro Research’s co-founder. “These factors firming in concert is more supportive of upside,” he said.

Read Investors Aren’t Quitting Stocks—Yet on bloomberg.comLet bank earnings be your guide, investors.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday and Friday. Here are five things the reports show about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tax cuts and how the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes are affecting consumers.

JPMorgan and Citigroup are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS.

1) Taxes Are Already Padding Profits at U.S. Corporations.

Deep cuts in U.S. corporate tax rates, thanks to President Donald Trump's fiscal-stimulus law inked in December, are already serving up a windfall to the big banks - even with less-than-stellar performance in core areas such as loan growth.

To see the impact, just compare the financial companies' pre-tax profit growth in the first quarter with after-tax results. JPMorgan's pre-tax profit climbed by 28% from a year earlier. But net income, after taxes, soared by 35%. At Wells Fargo, pre-tax profit actually declined last quarter by 5%. But thanks to the tax cuts, the bank was able to report a 5% increase in net income.

Aside from simply helping the companies' CEOs look better on paper, the tax bounty represents money that can be paid out to shareholders in the form of fat dividends or stock buybacks -- instead of the government.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told investors on a conference call Thursday that corporate executives are already starting to move money around due to the tax cuts -- a phenomenon that can be viewed in flows in and out of the company's various investment funds, which have $6 trillion-plus of assets under management.

"We saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and sought liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases," Fink said. "And we're very well positioned for additional organic growth opportunities related to the prospects of a rising rate environment and as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform."

TheStreet's founder Jim Cramer analyzes bank earnings below.

2) Tax Cuts Are Making It Easier for Borrowers to Repay Their Loans -- Another Bonus for Banks.

Bank executives expect Trump's tax cuts to leave borrowers with more cash to repay debts - leading to lower loan losses and, in turn, bigger profits for the banks. That's especially helpful now that the Federal Reserve is raising U.S. interest rates, which increases the cost of floating-rate loan payments while making it more expensive for borrowers to refinance fixed-rate debt when it comes due.

"Across the board, actually, all the way from small business through middle market, we're expecting sort of higher earnings, more free cash flow, and generally speaking that would improve the credit quality of the portfolio," JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake told investors on a conference call. "No doubt it helps, but it helps in a rising rate environment. There's a lot of plusses and minuses but yes, it's a tailwind for credit overall."

3) Consumers Are Responding to Higher U.S. Interest Rates by Taking Out Fewer Home Loans.

As interest rates rise, refinancing a mortgage becomes a less-attractive option for many existing homeowners, while new-home buyers face less affordable monthly payments on loans for purchases. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes - the key driver of mortgage rates - currently are around 2.8%. But bank executives are starting to worry that a move above 3% could hit mortgage-underwriting profits hard.

In the first quarter, Wells Fargo originated $43 billion of home loans, down from $53 billion in the fourth quarter.

"Businesses like mortgage will do better on the origination front if longer rates remain at about where they are today, versus begin to move above 3%," Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry told investors on a separate conference call. "There's some question about affordability in some markets, and so originations come down."

4) Banks Are Still Pocketing Higher Interest Rates -- Rather Than Passing Them on to Customers.

Rather than pass along higher interest rates to individual savers in the form of higher deposit rates, big banks are mostly pocketing the extra money they collect from rising loan rates. Corporations, on the other hand, are seeing big increases in their deposit rates because banks are so keen to keep them happy as lucrative customers.

The metric to watch is "deposit beta" - essentially the percentage of each Fed rate hike that gets passed along to customers. The higher the number, the better it is for savers; the lower the number, the better it is for bank profits.

John Gerspach, Citigroup's CFO, told investors: "As we continue to get rate increases and the rate increases increase also in frequency, you're going to start to see some pressure on those deposit betas. It's just inevitable, and it's going to happen. Hasn't happened yet."

He added: "I'd say corporate betas have moved up certainly more than consumer betas and that's been consistent at least for the last year. So, you have a mixed component in the beta. Not every beta is the same."

5) Banks Are Mostly Insulated From a Recent Surge in Money-Market Rates; That's Not the Case for Commercial Borrowers Whose Interest Payments Are Tethered to the Rates.

Money-market rates - as measured by the three-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor - have spiked in recent months as Trump's tax cuts force the U.S. government to borrow more money to plug the widening deficit. The trend has led to a bigger supply of Treasury bills coming to market, forcing the government to pay higher yields to attract additional buyers.

Being in the middle of the financial system as both a borrower and lender of funds, banks' exposure to Libor rates is partly hedged.

"Examples of assets that we price off Libor would be the commercial banking loans and, obviously, unhedged or hedged long-term debt on the liability side," JPMorgan's Lake said on the company's conference call Friday. "If you look sort of net across the assets and liabilities sides, they materially offset."

Click here to see his holdings for FREE.Apr.13 -- Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry discusses the bank's first-quarter results, the lending business, and Fed constraints on deposits from other banks. He speaks with Bloomberg's Julia Chatterley on "What'd You Miss?"As President Donald Trump threatens to launch missile strikes in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack, and continues his harsh tone against Russia, tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen’s proxy war continue to mount.

These key geopolitical developments have placed tremendous upward pressure on global oil prices, but there is another take away that is often being glossed over in energy news – this tension also has a significant impact on global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices.

How we got here

Trump said on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7. He also chastised Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Yet, on Thursday, Trump back-peddled, stating on Twitter: “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!”

Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our “Thank you America?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2018





Also, on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia faced what the Associated Press (AP) called a flurry of attempted attacks by Yemeni rebels. Saudi Arabia’s defense forces said they intercepted missiles that targeted key infrastructure in Riyadh and another city, and drones targeting an airport and an Aramco oil facility in the country’s south.

Impact on LNG

Correspondingly, Asian LNG prices this week rose by 25 cents from last week to $7.25/MMBtu, despite falling demand due to the onset of spring in the northern hemisphere. Historically, prices drop in the warmer weather months as demand for the super cooled fuel recedes.

Related: Saudi Arabia’s $80 Oil Target Could Backfire

For example, this past winter as China ramped up gas demand as part Beijing’s mandate to replace dirtier burning coal needed for power generation with gas, LNG prices breached the $11/MMBtu mark, the highest in three years. However, almost on cue, gas prices have dropped nearly 40 percent since those January highs due to warmer temperatures.

Oil price linkage

In Asia, most natural gas is imported as LNG, while the price is indexed to crude oil on a long-term contractual basis, though there has been an increase in spot and short-term trading in recent years. Consequently, geopolitical pressure on oil prices also impacts LNG prices.

The Asia Pacific market accounts for around three-quarters of global LNG trade and one-third of global natural gas trade. Moreover, increased gas and LNG demand growth in Asia will largely be driven by China.

Since there is currently no globally integrated market for natural gas, pricing mechanisms vary by regional market. Internationally traded natural gas has also been largely indexed to crude oil prices such as North Sea Brent or Japan customs-cleared crude (JCC) because of the liquidity and transparency of crude oil prices and the substitutability of natural gas and petroleum products in certain markets.

Related: Are Oil Markets Tightening Too Fast?

The possibility of higher LNG prices due to its oil price indexation and geopolitical risk could prove a boon for LNG projects outside the U.S., especially those that still need to sign long-term supply agreements to reach the all-important final investment decision (FID) to move forward. U.S. projects, for their part, offer Henry Hub-linked LNG pricing.

More geopolitical pressure on prices

Reuters, citing traders, said the LNG price gain this week was due to rising oil prices, as Brent crude futures hit their highest level since late-2014.

“Oil is by far the world’s biggest energy market. It dictates the direction for most other commodities,” said one trader. “It is particularly important for gas and LNG as many supply contracts are priced off crude.”

Global oil prices held steady on Friday but remained close to recent highs. Global benchmark Brent crude settled at $72.58 a barrel, up 56 cents by the end of the session, while U.S. benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 32 cents to $67.39. Prices for both climbed in post-settlement trading.

Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP, said “it does look like there's further upside ahead. People are still nervous about what's going to happen in Syria ... nothing was solved overnight."

More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:The market appears to be painting JPMorgan (JPM) with the same brush as Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citigroup (C) after their quarterly releases, but the fact is that JPMorgan’s report represented all around strength and offers useful read-throughs for what to expect from pure-play investment banks, trust banks and regional operators in the coming days.



It isn’t hard to appreciate the market’s negative reaction to the Wells and Citi reports, but the post-release weakness in JPMorgan shares is likely nothing more than a sell-the-news type of mindset. There is likely a comparability ground for the market’s lack of appreciation for these results as well. Two new accounting rules took effect this quarter, one dealing with revenue recognition on the asset management side and the other dealing with the valuation of ‘hard-to-price’ securities on the balance sheets. The earnings releases specify the impact of these rule changes, but they add to the ‘noise’ around these results.



Wells Fargo didn’t seem to benefit much from higher interest rates as rival JPMorgan did, likely indicating that the beleaguered bank had the wrong type of interest rate hedges in place. The bank is in the process of concluding a regulatory settlement that will require a restatement of today’s results in the coming days, but management wasn’t able to shed any more light on that issue beyond indicating that more details should be available in the 10Q. As such, it’s hard to read too much into Wells’ Q1 report as it will undergo a restatement in the coming days



We recently made a contrarian call on Wells by adding it to the Zacks Focus List, our core thesis being that worst was already priced in the stock and the market will slowly be coming around to appreciating this fact. The internals of the Wells report indicate that the estimate revisions trend for the current and coming quarters will likely be negative, in contrast to what can reasonably be expected for JPMorgan and Citi, which will keep the stock under pressure. This means that our Focus List call on Wells may have been premature, with the stock’s underperformance relative to its peers likely to persist a lot longer than we envisaged.



The chart below shows the year-to-date performance comparison Citi, JPMorgan, Wells and the S&P 500 index.

Wells’ net interest margin, the difference between what it pays depositors and what it charges borrowers, was flat from the preceding quarter and down from the year-earlier level. Growth in the bank’s loan portfolio and expenses also compare unfavorably with its peers. Wells’ loan portfolio was down from the year-earlier level while the same at Citi and JPMorgan were up +7% and 8%, respectively.



Citi’s results failed to impress as well, with the bank’s trading business, particularly the fixed income desk, failed to fully capitalize on the all-around volatility in Q1. Unlike JPMorgan’s +8% revenue growth in the fixed income, currencies and commodities or FICC business, Citi’s FICC revenue was down -7% in Q1.



Finance Sector Scorecard (as of Friday, April 13th)



We now have Q1 results from 5 of the 98 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 index. Keep in mind however that these 5 companies account for 23.7% of the sector’s total market capitalization in the index.



Total earnings for these 5 Finance companies are up +20.4% from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenue growth, with 100% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates. The comparison charts below put the results thus far in a historical context.

Story Continues

As you can see in the chart above, the sector’s growth picture is materially tracking above what we have been seeing in recent years, reflecting the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and more ‘normal’ capital markets activity. The right-hand side chart shows that earnings surprises are very numerous, but keep in mind that we are talking about 5 earnings reports at this stage.



For the quarter as a whole, total Finance sector earnings are expected to be up +22.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This would follow +0.6% earnings growth in 2017 Q4 on +4% higher revenues.



The sector’s earnings growth momentum is expected to continue in the coming quarters as well, as the chart below shows.

Please note that the sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond isn’t a function of easy comparisons, but actual growth. You can see this in the dollar value of total sector earnings in the chart below.

The table below shows the sector’s Q1 earnings growth expectations at the medium-industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding four periods.

Please note that the Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Bank of America and others are part, accounts for roughly 45% of the sector’s total earnings (insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor, accounting for about 25% of the total).



Driving this improved earnings picture for the banks and other finance companies is the combination of lower taxes and higher interest rates.



Expectations for 2018 Q1 As a Whole



The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue this reporting cycle as well, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up +16.6% from the same period last year on +7.5% higher revenues. This would follow the +13.4% earnings growth on +8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than 6 years.



There were two aspects of the preceding earning season that really stood out and put that reporting cycle in a category of its own; we will be looking to what extent these two aspect s get repeated this earnings season. These two standout features of the 2017 Q4 earnings season were the very strong momentum on the revenue front and impressive turnaround on the estimate revisions front.



The revenue momentum likely reflected a combination of the synchronized global growth environment and a favorable foreign exchange backdrop. With both of those factors still very much in play in Q1 as well, we can reasonably expect to see the revenue momentum trend continue this earnings season as well.



The story about trends in 2018 Q1 estimate revisions is better told by the chart below.

What this chart shows is that earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1 moved up significantly since mid-December 2017. This represented a major trend shift relative to what we have been seeing over the last many years when estimates would actually be moving in the opposite direction. To be fair, the revisions trend had stabilized in the preceding quarters as well, with estimates for 2017 Q4 essentially remaining unchanged in the three months ahead of the start of that reporting cycle.



A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts, but that isn’t the only reason, as you can see in the revisions trend for revenues in the chart below.

We will be keeping a close eye on how estimates for 2018 Q2 evolve as companies report Q1 results and share their outlook for Q2 and beyond. Estimates for Q2 went up as well, as they did for the following quarters, when the same was happening to 2018 Q1 estimates. As of today, total Q2 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +17.7% from the same period the year before on +7.2% higher revenues.



The chart below shows 2018 Q1 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to accelerate in Q2 and continue in the following quarters.

As you can imagine, expectations for full-year 2018 are for an impressive showing, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be +17.8% from the year-earlier level on +5.2% higher revenues. If achieved, this will be the highest annual growth pace for the index since 2010.



The table below shows the summary picture for 2018 Q1, contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding period.

Standout Sectors



As you can see, the Energy sector remains a big growth contributor in Q1, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +59.4% from the year-earlier period on +16.1% higher revenues. But growth for the quarter would still be in double-digits even on an ex-Energy basis (last row in the table above).



What is driving the strong Q1 growth isn’t the Energy sector, but rather the breadth of growth across all sectors, with double-digit earnings growth for 11 out of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Technology and Finance.



For the Technology sector, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +20.7% on +11.4% higher revenues, which would follow the sector’s impressive +24.2% earnings growth on +11.1% higher revenue growth.



The Finance sector, which sat out the preceding quarter with an essentially flat showing, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +22.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues.



Driving the Finance sector’s strong growth in Q1 and beyond is the combined effect of tax cuts, higher interest rates and an improved domestic growth environment. Finance sector’s earnings were only up +1.2% in full-year 2017 and in low single digits in the three years prior to that, but are on expected to be up an impressive +25.1% in full-year 2018.



The Technology sector, on the other hand, has already been on stronger ground, with full-year 2017 earnings for the sector up +15.8% and expected to be up +17.3% in 2018. The enterprise spending environment was expected to improve this year even before the tax cuts, with the tax windfall expected to give a much needed boost to those trends. On top of these we have the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data that are expected to remain growth areas in the space.



Please note that Technology and Finance aren’t just any two sectors out of the 16 in the S&P 500 index; these two sectors combined are the twin pillars of index’s total profitability, bringing in more than 40% of the index’s total earnings this year. The Energy sector’s outlook has improved, but the sector simply lacks the heft of these two. The Energy sector is expected to bring in about 5% of the index’s total earnings this year.



Reporting Calendar

As you can see in the chart above, the reporting cycle is ramping up with more than 150 companies reporting results, including 56 S&P 500 members. While the bulk of this week’s reports are dominated by the Finance sector, we have a number of leading players from other sectors reporting results already. The major non-financial reports on deck to report results this week include Netflix (NFLX) on Monday, IBM (IBM) on Tuesday, and Schlumberger (SLB) and GE (GE) on Friday.

About 90% of Americans have seen a bump in take-home pay since the new tax law went into effect at the beginning of February.

Millennials are more inclined to put the extra cash toward savings, investing, and paying down debt, according to a Bank of America survey.

Gen X is more likely to use the additional income for day-to-day spending.

What would you do if you suddenly had more money in your pocket?

If you're a millennial, the answer may likely be "save it."

The tax bill signed by President Trump back in December resulted in a bump in take-home pay for about 90% of Americans beginning in February, according to the IRS.

With more money in their pockets, workers are mostly putting it toward savings or paying down debt, according to a Bank of America survey of about 1,200 employed Americans.

But there's a difference between the behaviors of Gen X and millennials that suggests "a greater sense of responsibility than often credited" to the latter.

A higher share of millennials, respondents between the ages of 22 and 37, reported saving (20%), investing (17%), or paying down debt (8%) with their tax reform windfall, while more Gen Xers than millennials said they were using the money for day-to-day spending (11% versus 8%).

Interestingly, about 20% of millennial and Gen X respondents said they didn't get a tax cut, but Bank of America assumes some people simply didn't notice the difference, or it was delayed.

Business Insider previously calculated how the change in tax brackets effects single, childless workers who are paid every other week (26 paychecks a year). The new tax law resulted in increases ranging from $7.78 per paycheck for a worker earning $20,000 a year, to $118.45 per paycheck for someone earning $269,600 a year.

The amounts were based on new guidelines released in January by the IRS, known as tax-withholding tables, that help employers calculate how much to take out of employees' paychecks in taxes.

In many ways, Gen X is worse off financially than millennials; their saving and spending habits, and lack of retirement planning are "concerning." Nonmortgage debt has increased for Gen Xers, from an average $20,000 in 2014 to $23,000 in 2017, according to a 2017 report from Allianz Life Insurance Company.

The same report revealed 41% of millennials contribute to savings each month, compared to 36% of Gen Xers. Incredibly, the two generations both have about $35,000 saved for retirement, despite at most a 15-year age difference.

DON'T MISS: Americans don't spend enough on their credit cards to get the travel rewards they expected — here's how to make sure you don't miss outApple’s past several days have been marked by two things: new iPhone and talk of HomePod sales disappointing.

The tech giant on Monday unveiled the new red iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The handset is part of a (PRODUCT)RED lineup of devices from Apple that makes donations to fight AIDS. But while Apple was trying to celebrate that release, a Bloomberg report surfaced, saying the company has been disappointed by HomePod smart speaker sales and has cut its forecasts. To pile on, a judge this week awarded a long-time Apple patent foe, VirnetX, a $502 million cash windfall.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter

Needless to say, it wasn’t the best of weeks for Apple. But read on to learn more about some of the tech giant’s biggest news from the past week:

This is Fortune’s latest weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news. Here’s last week’s roundup.

Apple this week released the new (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The handsets come with a red color finish and have the same internal components as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models Apple released last year. Since they’re (PRODUCT)RED iPhones, Apple donates a portion of the proceeds to fight AIDS. In a statement this week, Apple said that it’s donated more than $160 million to the Global Fund, an organization that works to eradicate AIDS, through its (PRODUCT)RED sales. In addition to iPhones, Apple sells (PRODUCT)RED wireless headphones, iPod Touch, and watchbands for its Apple Watch. The HomePod smart speaker Apple released earlier this year is proving to be far less appealing to consumers than the company had hoped, according to a report this week from Bloomberg. The news outlet, which cited sources who claim to have knowledge of Apple’s sales, reported that Apple has reduced its sales forecast on HomePod. The report also said that HomePod sales are far behind those of its competitors, Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple, however, has not announced actual HomePod sales figures. A federal judge this week ordered Apple to pay $502 million in damages to security company VirnetX for allegedly violating four patents VirnetX owns. The battle between the companies, which has nearly spanned a decade, centers on whether Apple’s FaceTime, iMessage, and VPN On Demand services violate communications-related patents owned by VirnetX. This isn’t the end, however: a patent court recently ruled that the four patents are invalid and could help Apple overturn the damages ruling and ultimately win the case if the invalidity decision is upheld. A report out of Korea this week said the iPhone maker could face sanctions over its business dealings with carriers in that country. According to the report from the Korea Herald, Apple has required its Korean carrier partners to advertise the iPhone and perform repairs on broken handsets at their own cost—a possible violation of local laws. The Korean Federal Trade Commission is reportedly deciding whether to fine Apple for those alleged practices. Apple did not respond to a Fortune request for comment on the report this week. Apple said on Monday that its worldwide business is now 100% powered by clean energy, up from 96% of all of its facilities across 43 countries reporting full clean energy in 2017. Apple added that nine of its manufacturing partners have also agreed to power facilities that produce the company’s products on clean energy, bringing that total number to 23 partners.

One more thing…Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has joined the #DeleteFacebook movement to protest the world’s largest social network’s collection of user data and its apparent dissemination to third-parties. The news came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress over his company’s ongoing scandal.Despite overwhelmingly positive reviews, Apple’s HomePod doesn’t seem to be resonating with consumers. Following up on a pair of reports claiming that HomePod sales have been lackluster, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on Friday issued a new research note (via MacRumors) echoing the notion that the HomePod, to be blunt, simply isn’t selling well.

While some of the earlier and more optimistic projections suggested that HomePod sales for 2018 might be as high as 10 million units, Kuo anticipates that Apple, by the time 2018 draws to a close, may see HomePod sales fall somewhere in the 2 million range. While it’s still far too early to call the HomePod a flop, Apple’s smart speaker certainly hasn’t gotten off to a strong start in the marketplace.

Part of the problem is that the HomePod is simply an expensive smart speaker. Priced at $349, it’s significantly pricier than competing devices from the likes of Google and Amazon. And though the HomePod delivers unparalleled sound quality, it’s perhaps possible that everyday users simply aren’t interested in paying a premium for the HomePod when they find the audio quality on a device like the Amazon Echo to be ‘good enough.’

Additionally, it’s no secret that Siri’s capabilities on the HomePod aren’t even close to matching what rival intelligent assistants can pull off. Not only that, the version of Siri that ships with the HomePod is stunted relative to the Siri experience on the iPhone.

Kuo’s note reads in part:

However, we note that for most users worldwide, Siri is not a must-have function, and Apple has not yet become a leading brand in the AI voice assistant market. We also note that HomePod has not added support for new languages in the device since launch, suggesting Apple is facing challenges in AI/voice assistant development spanning the globe; this will cap the shipments momentum of HomePod.

In light of poor sales, Kuo corroborates previous reports claiming that Apple is mulling over a more affordable HomePod device. While details remain hazy, previous reports have claimed that Apple later this year may release a HomePod somewhere in the $150 range, a price point that would instantly make the device far more competitive with rival products. It remains unclear, though, what a more affordable HomePod model would bring to the table in terms of features. Either way, if Apple is serious about competing in the smart speaker market, it’s starting to become apparent that the company will have to do something to shake things up lest it fall too far behind.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold and oil will extend their gains on Monday, albeit modestly, when markets open for the first time since Western powers launched a missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to suffer big losses unless the West strikes again or Russia retaliates.

"The news flow is actually better than what it looked like at one point during last week as the strike was surgical, followed by a pullback. Reports show a lot of care was taken not to hit Russian targets, which is a good sign and the market should take heart from that," said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier investment managers in London.

Gold has benefited in recent days as a safe-haven asset amid a U.S.-China trade dispute and the escalating conflict in Syria, which also pushed oil above $70 per barrel due to concerns about a spike in Middle Eastern tensions.

World stocks wobbled last week but still ended with the best weekly gain in over a month, as investors await potentially healthy U.S. company earnings.

Despite heightened geopolitical risks, the impact on so-called safe-haven assets has been short-lived and modest. While the yen rose initially on fears of a Syrian strike, it ended near seven-week lows to the dollar last week.

On Saturday, U.S., French and British missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria's chemical weapons program in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago, although the assault appeared unlikely to halt Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's progress in the seven-year-old civil war.

The bombing, denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression, was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his powerful ally Russia.

But the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said gold was poised to gain on Monday but the rally wouldn't be very steep: "The focus will be on the counter-reaction from Russia."

Gold, often used as a store of value in times of political and economic uncertainty, could rally towards $1,400 per ounce after two consecutive weeks of gains.

"If we do break above $1,365, that next week we would be very bullish," said Aslam.

Tokyo will be the first major market to open on Monday and the yen will likely strengthen to the dollar, but not beyond 106.50, said Itsuo Toshima, market analyst at Toshima & Associates adding that he didn't expect stocks traders to make sharp moves.

"The first attack was within expectations and was already priced in the market ... However, if there is a second round of strikes, that is not in line with expectations. So that should prompt a sharp risk-off move in markets," he added.

Frank Benzimra, head of global markets for Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking, said stocks would plunge only in case of new strikes by Western powers.

In case of such an escalation, oil would rally further, the yen would spike and Japan's domestic defensive stocks would outperform international stocks.

"For the stress on Asia equity markets to be sustainable, we would need to have oil prices spiking to such a level that fundamental concerns, i.e. higher inflation and risks on growth, return to the market," he said.

Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects said that despite Middle Eastern tensions and looming new U.S. sanctions on Iran, oil has outperformed most expectations this year and may have rallied too far too fast.

"We are likely to get a sell-off this week as the extent of the Syrian strikes have been muted and, in general, calmer nerves prevail in Washington," she said.

Oil traders had locked in long positions ahead of the weekend, in anticipation of potential strikes, sending both West Texas Intermediate <CLc1> and global benchmark Brent <LCOc1> crude futures to their highest since 2014.

Moscow (Russia) (AFP) - New Western air strikes in Syria would provoke "chaos" in international relations, Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on Sunday.

Speaking to Rouhani by telephone the day after US-led strikes on suspected chemical weapons facilities, Putin said "if such actions, carried out in violation of the United Nations Charter, are repeated, that would inevitably provoke chaos in international relations," according to a statement from the Kremlin.

The two leaders "found that this illegal action seriously damaged the prospects of a political settlement in Syria," the statement said.

The United States, France and Britain on Saturday launched strikes against Bashar al-Assad's government a week after an alleged chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma, just east of the capital Damascus.

Putin denounced on Saturday "with the utmost firmness" the strikes which he described as "an act of aggression against a sovereign state which is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism".

For more news videos visit Yahoo View.MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States will want to maintain a dialogue with Russia about strategic stability following Western missile strikes on Syria, Russian news agencies cited a Russian Foreign Ministry official as saying on Sunday.

"There is every reason to believe that after the U.S. strikes on Syria, the Americans will be eager to move to a strategic dialogue," Interfax news agency quoted Vladimir Ermakov, head of the foreign ministry's department for non-proliferation and arms control, as saying.

"You cannot say the Americans ... do not demonstrate a desire to lead a strategic dialogue," he said. "In the U.S. administration there are specific people who it is possible to talk with."

Al-Bab (Syria) (AFP) - Hundreds of miles from their homes in Syria's wrecked Eastern Ghouta, displaced Syrians say Western air strikes Saturday in response to an alleged chemical attack there were too little, too late.

The United States, Britain and France targeted military and research sites in Syria after the purported toxic attack on Eastern Ghouta's last rebel holdout of Douma a week earlier.

Medics and rescuers said the alleged chemical attack killed more than 40 people in Douma, weeks into a brutal regime air and ground assault to retake the wider region on the outskirts of Damascus from rebels.

"We're so happy to see that someone felt for us," said Nadia Sidawi, 46, one of thousands of displaced Douma residents now living in northern Syria after they were evacuated from the town.

But "the strikes are not enough," said the mother-of-eight, sitting on a mattress outside a white tent in a camp for the displaced more than 400 kilometres (250 miles) from her home in Douma.

President Bashar al-Assad "killed us -- our children, our women. He destroyed our homes," said the housewife, whose hair was wrapped in a black scarf.

More than 1,700 civilians were killed in a Russia-backed regime assault on Eastern Ghouta since mid-February.

Since then, Assad's forces have retaken almost the entire rebel bastion through the military operation and Moscow-brokered evacuation deals.

An agreement for the Jaish al-Islam rebels who once controlled Douma has seen thousands of people -- rebels and civilians -- bussed up to a rebel-held area of the northern province of Aleppo.

- 'Nobody stopped them' -

Jaish al-Islam fighter Saleh Ibrahim, 26, said he was not optimistic that Saturday's air strikes would have any long-term impact on Syria's seven-year war.

"If Western countries had really wanted to get rid of Assad, they would have done it seven years ago," he said, at the camp for the displaced near the city of Al-Bab.

Syria's conflict started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests and has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers.

Nada, a 40-year-old nurse from Douma who did not give her second name, said the US-led air strikes were more than warranted but came far too late.

Before the regime launched heavy air strikes on Eastern Ghouta on February 18, people in the former opposition bastion had endured five years of regime siege and food shortages.

"Nobody stopped them from besieging us. Children died of malnutrition," the nurse said.

"Everybody held meetings and negotiations and nothing came of anything," said the mother-of-six, who said she has lost touch with some of her children since being evacuated from Ghouta.

Numerous rounds of UN-backed talks have failed to stem Syria's conflict, which has killed more than 350,000 people and displaced more than half the country's population.

Backed by Russia, regime forces have taken back large parts of Syria in the past few years. Fully retaking Eastern Ghouta would be a major achievement for Assad.

Abu Adnan al-Doumani, 42, said he was also disappointed in Western powers.

"The United States, France and the United Kingdom always said they were friends of the Syrian people," said the unemployed father-of-six, who wore a long black beard.

"But they have proven to be out worst enemies as Assad is in fact their protege," he said.

"They let him do what he wants, kill who he wants."

Unfortunately for the Blazers, it was Anthony Davis who paid them a visit on Saturday night. And now they don’t have home-court anymore.

[NBA Playoffs Bracket Challenge: $1M for the perfect bracket]

The five-time All-Star spent the last two months of the season carrying the Pelicans to their first playoff berth in three years, and he continued his dominant play to kick off the postseason, scoring a game-high 35 points to lead New Orleans to a 97-95 win on Saturday, and a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven opening-round series against the higher-seeded Blazers.

Davis made 14 of his 26 field goal attempts, and pulled down 14 rebounds, blocked four shots and snagged two steals in 41 minutes of floor time, dominating the Blazers’ frontcourt of Jusuf Nurkic, Al-Farouq Aminu and Evan Turner with a devastating array of offensive firepower — in transition and in the half-court, facing up and rolling to the rim off a screen, attacking early and redeeming possessions late in the clock — on his way to the first playoff win of his career, and New Orleans’ first postseason victory since 2011, when they were still called the Hornets.

As impressive as Davis and the Pelicans were for the bulk of the contest, leading by as many as 19 points in the third quarter after totally shutting down the Blazers’ offense to the tune of only 36 points on 15-for-47 shooting in the first half, Portland gave themselves a chance late by roaring back in the final five minutes. After Evan Turner rebounded his own missed triple, Lillard made the extra pass for a right corner 3-pointer by McCollum that capped a 17-5 run to draw the Blazers within one at 93-92 with 59.8 seconds to go in regulation.

After a scramble drill on both ends of the floor — Turner swiping the ball away from driving Pelicans guard Ian Clark on the ensuing possession to get the Blazers out in transition, only for New Orleans stopper Jrue Holiday to totally blanket McCollum in the open floor and steal the ball right back — both teams’ top guns had a chance to deliver a big blow. Both came up short, though.

Davis missed a potential dagger 3-pointer with 28 seconds to go, and on the next trip, Lillard drove around Holiday into the paint but pulled up a beat early — perhaps trying to back into Holiday and draw a foul to get himself to the free throw line on a night where he was struggling with his shot, perhaps not wanting to go all the way to the rim to try a shot for fear of testing Davis, who’d already packed him on one drive earlier in the quarter — and short-armed a floater that kept the Pelicans’ lead at 93-92 with 12 seconds to go.

After a pair of AD freebies and a Blazers timeout, Portland still had a chance to tie if Stotts could draw up a play that would pop one of his shooters free for a clean look beyond the arc. But the Pelicans were ready for Portland’s actions on two consecutive inbounds plays, taking away the long-range options that could’ve tied the game, forcing the Blazers to just go for a quick two, and then stifling those, as well.

First, Holiday broke from the perimeter into the paint to deflect a pass away from little-used Blazers center Meyers Leonard. Then, after the ball was ruled out off of Holiday’s hand and the Blazers got another crack at a game-tying play, Holiday again recovered into the paint to snuff a layup by Pat Connaughton that effectively ended Portland’s hopes of completing the comeback:

The final-minute heroics — the open-court stop on McCollum, the deflection on Leonard, the block on Connaughton — served as a tremendous reintroduction to Holiday for those who might not have been paying much attention to the oft-injured former Philadelphia 76ers All-Star.

“It’s funny, because we always put a clip on [the video edit that the Pelicans’ coaches show their players] that says ‘game-winning plays,’ and today, it actually was Jrue blocking [Connaughton’s] shot in the Portland game,” Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry said after the game. “Same guy, almost the exact same area and he came up with another block.”

“It’s the playoffs,” Holiday said after the game. “A lot of excitement and a lot of energy especially in the building. Obviously, that was a really big stop, and at that moment, it felt good to get a stop. It felt good to know that all the hard work we put in this game, we got the win, so we did a really good job at that.”

Holiday has worked to earn the nine-figure contract he received this summer by turning in arguably the best season of his career and, since the unfortunate season-ending injury to All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins, working as the Pelicans’ clear second-best player — a quality lead guard with the shooting, skill and size to play off the ball, who also happens to be an All-Defensive Team-caliber disruptor capable of guarding the other team’s best player at every perimeter position on any given night.

“I just think, like I’ve said, with Kawhi Leonard not dressed and playing, I don’t know if there’s a better two-way player in the game,” Gentry said of Holiday.

He merited that praise on Saturday, proving equal to the task of both dampening Lillard — 18 points on just 6-for-23 shooting in 42 minutes — and supporting Davis, finishing with 21 points on 10-for-20 shooting to go with seven rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal in 39 minutes in the home-court-wresting win.

The Pelicans’ two stars had help. Nikola Mirotic, the floor-stretching power forward imported from the Chicago Bulls at the start of February as New Orleans looked to bounce back from Boogie’s Achilles tear, chipped in 16 points with 11 rebounds, four blocks, three assists and two steals. Veteran point guard Rajon Rondo further bolstered his postseason bona fides, keeping the Pelicans running on time and on target by dishing out 17 assists, grabbing eight rebounds, and turning the ball over only twice in 39 minutes of work.

Swingman E’Twaun Moore did yeoman’s work in harassing McCollum (19 points on 18 shots in 38 minutes) all over the court. Former Warriors reserve Ian Clark pitched in 10 points off the bench, including a big 3-pointer with 2:29 to go to help stem the Blazers’ run.

There were silver linings for Portland. Despite opening the playoffs with one of their most abysmal halves of the season, despite shooting just 37.8 percent from the field as a team, and despite watching their two leading scorers combine to shoot just 13-for-41 from the field, the Blazers had chances to win it in the final minutes. Stotts got good minutes from the reserve frontcourt of Ed Davis (six points, 13 rebounds) and rookie Zach Collins (eight points, three assists, two rebounds, two steals), and the Blazers did get the offensive cranked up after halftime, scoring 59 points with Lillard (15 points, 3-for-5 from deep) and McCollum (19 points, 4-for-7) finding the range on their jumpers late.

But those silver linings come wrapped around a dark cloud: the Blazers just gave away the advantage they’d fought so hard to secure, and now they’ve got to come back on Tuesday with better answers for guarding Davis, for unleashing their playmakers in a pick-and-roll defended by elite stoppers Davis and Holiday, and for slowing a Pelicans team that’s not going to be satisfied with its first taste of postseason success.

“It means a lot to get that monkey off your back, to get that first win,” said Davis, who made the first playoff appearance of his career back in 2015, but was swept out of the first round by the eventual champion Golden State Warriors. “But now, that’s over with. We want to come in Tuesday and get another one.”

Philadelphia’s newly acquired cornerback, Daryl Worley, was arrested after being discovered passed out in a car blocking a highway near the team’s practice facility at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, according to multiple reports.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo say Worley became combative with police, who then fired a taser at the 23-year-old before taking him into custody. A gun was also reportedly found at the scene.

#Eagles CB Daryl Worley was arrested at 6 am this morning when he became combative with police and Philadelphia police administrated a taser on him, sources tell @MikeGarafolo and me. A gun was recovered on the scene. — Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) April 15, 2018





Worley is a Philadelphia native who was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in 2016 out of West Virginia. After a rookie season that saw the him pile up 152 tackles, two sacks, three interceptions and 19 pass deflections, the Eagles made Worley one of their first acquisitions this offseason by trading wide receiver Torrey Smith for him.

The Eagles are set to begin their offseason workout programs on Monday, April 16.

Neither the league nor the Eagles have released any information, however Philadelphia officials told Rapoport they are looking into the incident.

On Friday, PGA Tour pro Kelly Kraft caught a bizarre bad break that caused him to miss the cut at the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, South Carolina’s Harbour Town golf course.

Kelly hit what he said felt like a clean tee shot on the par 3 14th hole that hit a bird mid-flight before dropping into the water in front of the hole.

Kraft appealed for a re-do, invoking the cancel-and-replay rule that allows a golfer another shot without penalty if his shot hits a man-made object such as a power line. Since a bird isn’t a man-made object, officials didn’t award him another shot, forcing him to take a drop from the water and a penalty, because golf.

Kraft double-bogeyed the hole and missed the cut and a payday by one stroke.

“It cost me the cut, most likely,” Kraft told PGATour.com. “There was a helping wind, and I hit a 7-iron, caught it perfect. It was probably 30 yards off the tee box and this giant, black bird swooped in front of it and hit it and the ball fell 20 yards short in the water. It would’ve been in the middle of the green. It might have been close. I got screwed.”

The bird appeared to be OK, flying away after the collision according to PGATour.com.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) took notice and on Saturday did not appear sympathetic to Kraft’s cause in a statement made to USA Today.

“PETA is glad the bird is OK and sorry Kelly Kraft didn’t advance, but that’s not the bird’s fault,” PETA representative Lisa Lange told USA Today in a statement. “Of course, he would have advanced if he’d played better on other holes — so practice, practice, practice.”

PETA golf burn. Ouch.

Lange also reminded golf patrons and tournament to be kind to animals.

“To tournament holders: If animals are ever injured, they must be taken to a veterinarian right away.”

Don't judge a book by looking at the cover.

Whether you learned that lesson from your parents, from a teacher or from Bo Diddley, the message is universally accepted as a good one.

But in practice, sadly, it's not quite as well-adopted.

It's the message that Joe Maddon delivered Friday morning, a day after controversy arose because someone failed to remember that lesson.

That someone was Pittsburgh Pirates skipper Clint Hurdle, who criticized Javy Baez and questioned his "respect for the game" after Baez emphatically tossed a bat in frustration during Wednesday night's game. It wasn't exactly an unexpected moment from a player who seems to do everything at full go and has won tons of fans for his style of play. But it didn't appeal to Hurdle, whose team lost that game by a 13-5 score.

Baez defended himself after Thursday's game, defended his work ethic, defended his style of play. The following morning, Maddon said he was thrilled with how his player handled things and took the opportunity provided by Hurdle's judgments to offer an important life lesson to anyone paying attention - including Hurdle.

"I was surprised by it. I did not see it coming at all. Clint and I have had a great relationship, I've known him for many, many years. I don't really understand why he did what he did," Maddon said a day after controversy arose when Hurdle attacked Baez for not respecting the game in response to the Cubs second baseman tossing a bat during Wednesday's game.

"I've had commentary, and I don't deny that I have, but to try to disseminate exactly what I think about a guy on another team based on superficial reasons, I'll never go there. I don't know the guy enough. I'm not in the clubhouse with him. I don't have these conversations. I don't know what kind of a teammate he is. I don't know any of that stuff. I would really be hesitant.

Story Continues

"(It's) just like people making decisions about (Cubs relief pitcher Pedro) Strop just because of the way he wears his hat, or (Minnesota Twins closer and former Cub) Fernando Rodney. I think most of the time when you hear critical commentary, it's really, pretty much, self evaluation. It's about what you believe, it's about your judgmental component. It reveals you more than it reveals the person you're talking about. I've always believed that.

"So whenever you want to be hypercritical of somebody, just understand you're pretty much revealing yourself and what your beliefs are more than you are being critical or evaluating somebody, because you have not spent one second in that person's skin."

Who knows if Hurdle saw what Baez said after Wednesday's game, when he owned up to the "ugliness" of his bat toss on the pop up and talked about how a teammate approached him about his reaction and used it as a teaching moment.

But Maddon is among the many who watch this team on a daily basis who hope none of this changes how Baez plays the game. Baez is hands down one of the game's most exciting players at the plate, in the field and as a base runner. To tamp down his enthusiasm wouldn't just be bad for fans - it could cost the Cubs games. Baez is a flashy player, and all that flash turns into spectacular plays, must-see tags, huge home runs and game-winning trips around the bases.

"If you went to Puerto Rico, he fits in pretty well. You wouldn't really be all that concerned about how he plays the game or the methods. This is how we view things here," Maddon said. "For me, he plays with a joy. I also believe that guys that are really good at this game and in some regards do a lot of it easily, you almost want to accuse them of being flamboyant.

"I don't want him to be robotic. How about the play he made at shortstop yesterday? Is that flamboyant or is that outstanding? … Whether people describe it as flamboyant, I would have to believe that if you're paying a good dollar to come watch the Cubs play, you're looking for that flamboyant play that he's able to make that nobody else can.

"I love the way Javy plays baseball. I love the way Contreras plays baseball. I love the emotion and the passion. … I would much prefer that than the lethargic approach any day of the week."

As for how Hurdle's comments will reverberate with Baez himself, Maddon thinks they will have an effect, one that will be evident the next time the Cubs and Pirates get together.

"I just know it's going to motivate Javy, I really believe that," Maddon said. "Javy's motivated anyway, but I'll be eager to watch him perform in Pittsburgh from now on."Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant said he would have taken a pay cut if it was offered, but it wasn’t. That just solidified his feeling that some coaches and some former teammates had it in for him.

“I’m not here to bash anybody, but they know, man,” Bryant told Jane Slater of NFL Network. “They know. They know. The way this whole situation got handled, I felt like I asked some of them to be a man about some of the situations a long time ago, and they couldn’t. I’m not talking about no players, because all the players we A1. That’s one thing that we did. We learned from one another. . . . I’m trying my best to sugarcoat it, but I can’t.”

Bryant clarified he was talking about “some of the coaches” and later did talk about some players.

The Cowboys have turned over their coaching staff, and receivers coach Derek Dooley is one of those who left in the offseason. Head coach Jason Garrett and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan remain.

“Hey, I’m a direct guy. I only know one way to be. I wake up, sleep, breathe football,” Bryant said. “If somebody don’t like me, I would love to know that. I think you’re supposed to go about it that way, learn how to respect and work with somebody even if you don’t like that person. I did it. . . . I’m not here to bash anybody, but I’ve got to keep it real. I always kept it real. Jerry Jones, he loved me to death, and I loved him, too. I honestly did. I honestly believe in my heart this was a hard decision for him. When it’s five to six guys at a table against one guy, you’ve got to do it. Like Jerry told me in our meeting, he didn’t ask me to take a pay cut. He didn’t want that. That further lets me believe what I thought a long time ago.

“I don’t know. I don’t want to say it’s emotional. I’m not trying to call anybody out, but at the same time, this situation was very unfair to me. It was an unfair situation because if they did want to get rid of me, they could have told me that. They could have told me that, and I would have respected it. Just like I told Jerry in the meeting, I respect his decision.”

Story Continues

Bryant, who had a $12.5 million base salary and a $16.5 million cap number for 2018, was told Friday the Cowboys no longer wanted him. He blames some teammates for working against him, though he would not name names.

“I’ll say this right here: I believe that Garrett’s guys [worked against him]. I would say that,” Bryant said. “I believe that. I truly believe that. I won’t put no names out, but they know, and I want them to know on this air I know. I’ll shoot them a text message and let them know. Little do they know is they can wear that ‘C’ [for captain] all they want to, but in that locker room, they know who they run and they talk to. They know who they communicate with. Everybody know where the real love is at, and I’m not throwing anybody under the bus, but that’s the difference between me and them.”

The Cowboys’ captains in 2017 were Jason Witten, Dak Prescott, Dan Bailey, Tyrone Crawford, Sean Lee and Orlando Scandrick. Scandrick also was released this offseason. He signed with Washington.

Bryant is hoping to sign with an NFC East team, too, so he can play against the Cowboys twice a year.

“It’s a new chapter for me,” Bryant said. “It’s a new chapter and I’m ready to play ball, and I think I got an extra boost to want to do good, to want to get my body right, to want to perform at the highest level. I got something to prove to those coaches. I think they done came up with too much talk about me already. I’m ready to just prove them wrong.”Late last month, when Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett was pressed on the seemingly dangling, uncertain nature of Dez Bryant’s roster spot, he pushed back with optimism.

Speaking at the NFL owners’ meetings in Orlando, Garrett gushed about what a great player Bryant had been for the franchise. He waxed about Bryant’s competitive nature and desire, and insisted that the Dallas brain trust couldn’t wait to get the wideout “back in the fold” and working again.

“We love Dez,” Garrett said.

Be wary of optimistic lip-service in the NFL. Hopeful, half-committed words are often used as momentary odor eliminators, masking the fragrance of an inevitable reality. In the NFL it’s always better to draw conclusions from money and hardened actions. Signing Allen Hurns was a tangible action. The overweight salary cap commitment to the wide receiver position in Dallas was real. But the love professed for Bryant in March was a half-truth screaming for the pink-slipped qualifier that finally arrived Friday.

“We love Dez… when we look at his film from 2014.”

“We love Dez…but don’t think he’s worth $12.5 million.”

“We love Dez…but not as much as we love Dak Prescott.”

If Cowboys fans take anything away from Bryant’s release, those three truths are ironclad. Dallas looks at film and doesn’t see the same player who was an All Pro in 2014. It can’t reconcile his salary with the player it sees on the field. And above all else, it values Prescott, the quarterback, far more – and doesn’t believe the current skills of the two players suit one another. Wash off the cheap, lying perfume Dallas is spraying all over this situation and you’ll come to that trio of conclusions.

The Cowboys might be right, too. This move is going to be viewed through one prism next season: whether Prescott rebounds with a set of wideouts who apparently fit his growth curve better than Bryant. If Prescott succeeds, the sting of this week’s move will look justified. If Prescott fails, then the pain and frustration of this week will get worse. Why? The Cowboys’ brain trust will have to answer for sacrificing two beloved team icons – Tony Romo and Bryant – on a franchise quarterback gamble that fell flat.

Story Continues

For that reason alone, this move puts more pressure on Prescott. The fan base was already seemingly divided over his up-and-down performance last season, causing the euphoria of 2016 to fade and be replaced by justifiable questions. The second-guessing wondered if Romo was pushed aside too early. Or if running back Ezekiel Elliott’s availability ultimately determines how good Prescott is as an NFL quarterback.

Add Bryant into the mix, as he was sacrificed in part because of his fit with Prescott. The reasons have been leaking out of the Cowboys consistently since the start of last season.

Bryant wasn’t getting the separation that made him great. His routes weren’t precise enough. He wasn’t catching balls that weren’t perfectly placed. His effort wasn’t always where it needed to be. His game still contained an emotional component that wasn’t ideal for Prescott’s development. And then finally, he was making too much money to have three straight seasons of subpar production, regardless of the reasons for those performances.

For a guy Cowboys brass loves, it’s safe to say it didn’t always like everything about Bryant. And if Dallas denies that now, then it’s going to have to explain why it released him in a move that puts Prescott’s development in the hands of a wide receiving corps that appears to lack a dominant No. 1. Drafting a talent like Maryland’s D.J. Moore or Alabama’s Calvin Ridley could help in that respect, but it’s a stretch to guarantee either of those players can come in and be a dominant factor out of the gate.

Barring a trade or one of the current veteran wideouts suddenly becoming a Pro Bowl player, Dallas is signing up for nothing less than a transition year in the passing offense. One in which Prescott must take a huge stride forward and do most of his damage through an aggregation of solid-but-not-stellar options. It’s indeed possible if Elliott can keep himself on the field for a full season and the offensive line stays healthy and solidifies along the right side.

None of this is going to make sense without Prescott getting appreciably better. Only that will soothe the pain of this move and make the front office and coaching staff look like it knows what it’s doing. The Cowboys better hope they’re right about Prescott making the strides necessary to cover this moment because he didn’t exactly put the Romo “what-ifs” to bed last season. And another year of uneven performances will only accentuate how much Dallas has gambled on Prescott without the breakthrough it expects.

This latest development could be the right move. Or it could be a regrettable mistake. Regardless, Tony Romo and Dez Bryant are gone, while Dak Prescott remains. If you need to know who the Cowboys love right now, start with that reality first.

The man they call “Pasta” is eating the Toronto Maple Leafs for lunch.

David Pastrnak has been an absolute killer through the first two games of the Bruins-Leafs opening round showdown, netting four goals — including a Game 2 hat trick — and adding five helpers for nine points through the first two games of the series.

With his six-point effort on Saturday, Pastrnak ties an NHL record for points through the first two games of a playoff series, matching Phil Esposito who did it with the Bruins in the 1969 playoffs (also against the Maple Leafs).

Pastrnak has simply been toying with Toronto, so it’s only fitting that he completed his hatty on Saturday with this foolish between-the-legs backhander late in the third frame.

My sweet precious angel child David Pastrnak is having fun out there pic.twitter.com/gxd3crI6O4 — Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) April 15, 2018





The Bruins winger has been in on a whopping 75 percent of Boston’s 12 goals through the first two contests, averaging more than four points-per-game while leading the postseason in scoring so far. Pastrnak is now the youngest player ever to record six points in an NHL playoff game.

The Maple Leafs have had no answer for the Bruins top line as a whole, with Pastrnak, Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron combining for 20 points over the first two contests of the series — including 14 in Game 2 alone. The line, which was on the ice for all seven Boston goals on Saturday, is absolutely torching the Maple leafs defense corps from top-to-bottom, with a different pairing getting particularly victimized in each contest.

Game 1 saw the duo of Morgan Rielly and Ron Hainsey take the brunt of the torture from the Bruins top line, wtih Rielly specially having a tough night, putting forth one of the worst top-to-bottom performances of his NHL career. Game 2 featured the atrocious work of Jake Gardiner and Nikita Zaitzev, who were on the ice for the first four Bruins goals of the game on Saturday.

Heading back to home ice for Games 3 and 4 in Toronto, coach Mike Babcock will have a little more say in dictating the matchups. If the staff can’t make the right adjustments to stop the freight train that is the Pastrnak-Marchand-Bergeron unit, it really won’t matter.

Buffalo Bills guard Richie Incognito announced his retirement on Tuesday — which the team then made official on Thursday by placing him on the reserve/retired list — officially closing the book on his controversy-filled football career.

He told multiple reporters that his 12-year career in the NFL was over, and even tweeted at the NFL Players’ Association and its spokesman, George Atallah, saying “I’m done” with a tongue-out emoji.

It turns out, though, that may have been a hoax.

“That was a short lived retirement,” Incognito tweeted at Buffalo’s PR account on Friday night. “See you Monday for the offseason program.”

@BuffaloBillsPR That was a short lived retirement. See you Monday for off season program #madeyalook — Richie Incognito (@68INCOGNITO) April 14, 2018





The 34-year-old initially said he was retiring due to health issues.

“I’m done, I’m done, that’s it,” Incognito told Buffalo News Bills reporter Vic Carucci. “It’s been a long career. My liver and kidneys are shutting down. Nothing I can’t restore with some balance, but the stress is killing me.

“I went to a doctor’s appointment the other day and they said, ‘Listen, the stress is killing you, what are you doing?’ And I said, ‘Listen, I’m just doing what I love and that’s playing football.’ So that’s why I’m done …

“I just want to be in the Hall of Fame. I think I’m there.”

At this point, who knows if Incognito really will come out of his “retirement” or not for a 13th season in the NFL.

I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.
