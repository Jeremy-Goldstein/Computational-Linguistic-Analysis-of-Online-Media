It is also part of the Executive Pathways series and is required for the Executive Master of Science in Leadership program.In an era when citizens feel increasingly disillusioned with politics and government, the need for public managers to deliver public value has never been greater.

Understand what is distinctly public about their work.

Separate public value from commercial value.

Adapt their practices to rapidly changing expectations, aspirations, and social conditions.

Help Create a Good and Just Society

Recovering the Public in Public Value: Strategic Management in Government is a two-day program in Washington, DC that provides the tools public managers like you need to diagnose your environment, think strategically about the value you can generate, and act with the public to use government assets—all in pursuit of creating a good and just society.Given name

Why Choose CCL’s Maximizing Your Leadership Potential?Digitization is revolutionizing marketing strategy. From tablets and big data to new customer monitoring tools and the global emergence of social networking, recent technology has revolutionized the modes of communication through which businesses and brands engage with consumers. This course is designed to help executives understand the new rules of marketing in the digital age, covering a range of topics that include search marketing, social network marketing and analytics, predictive modeling, mobile advertising and commerce, CRM strategy, and digital advertising.

New digital technologies have fundamentally reshaped marketing theory and practice the last decade alone. Technology has changed the modes of communication through which firms engage with consumers. Moore's law has made the storage and analysis of consumer data scalable, creating opportunities for fine-grained behavioral analytics. New monitoring tools have fostered precise and personalized customer relationship management practices. The rise of mobile phones and tablets has enabled location based messaging and reciprocal communication. The ubiquity of video content has promulgated rich, native advertising programs. The global emergence of social networking has enabled networked based predictive modeling and new forms of targeting and referral strategies based on the preferences of consumers' peers. And finally, new social media have brought all of this onto the public stage, with word-of-mouth conversations driving brand awareness and brand loyalty, and user-generated content on review and ratings sites making or breaking demand for products or services.

This two-day course provides a detailed, applied perspective on the theory and practice of digital marketing and social media analytics in the 21st century. We will cover concepts such as the difference between earned and paid media, predictive modeling for ad targeting and customer relationship management, measuring and managing product virality, viral product design, native advertising, and engaging the multichannel experience. Throughout the course we will specifically stress the theory and practice of randomized experimentation, AB testing and the importance of causal inference for marketing strategy.

What makes some companies successful while others underperform? The question is simple but the answer is not - there is no single "rule for riches" that works for all companies in all situations. Instead, building and managing a successful organization requires careful consideration of how to create real, unique value for customers and the ability to capture some of that value to be profitable. This program provides the foundation for managers to think strategically about creating and capturing value within their organization. Through a series of discussions and exercises, participants will understand what value capture and creation means. They will also critically examine their current company strategies to identify where value is already being created, captured and lost. Participants will then use this knowledge to analyze their organization’s potential and begin building successful strategies.

The objective of this programme is to understand the structure of supply chains, and what causes some to succeed and others to fail in delivering value to the customer. The course will introduce analytical tools to design and evaluate supply chain based on the competitive nature of the industry and product characteristics.

The cost of managing the supply chain is substantial and sometimes as high as 40% of the total value-added in certain industries. A marginal reduction in the cost of operating the supply chain could lead to a more competitive pricing of products resulting in higher market share.
