FOUR years ago, Cho Hyun-ah, an executive at Korean Air made headlines around the world when she threw a fit because she was served macadamia nuts in their packaging rather than on a serving dish in first class on the airline. She reportedly insulted the cabin crew, threw documents at them, and forced them to kneel and beg forgiveness. At the time, she was a company vice president, and she made the plane return to its gate in order to remove the offending flight attendant. After spending several months in prison for breaking aviation-safety laws, Cho Hyun-Ah was able to return to her father’s conglomerate, this time managing hotels rather than Korean Air. But a new scandal may have finally accomplished what “nut rage” could not.

This month, police opened an investigation into Hyun-ah’s younger sister, Hyun-min, a marketing executive at Korean Air. It was alleged that she had thrown water at an advertising executive’s face during a business meeting. She apologised for her behaviour and claimed that she had thrown water on the floor, not in the other executive’s face. Cho Yang-ho, their father and chair of Korean Air, apologised on April 22nd for the behaviour of two of his daughters and announced that they would leave their management positions at the company.

In the end, Mr Cho may have had little choice but to remove his daughters from the company. Investigators raided the family’s homes and offices this month. And the company has grown so unpopular that some Koreans have called on their country’s government to stop the airline from using “Korean” in its name. “As chairman of Korean Air, as well as a father, I feel terrible about the immature actions of my daughters,” Mr Cho said in a statement. “Everything is my fault and my wrongdoing. I apologise to the people.”

The row comes at a bad time for Mr Cho’s family conglomerate, the Hainjin Group, which is recovering from several years of bad news. Korean Air had made several years of losses before and after the first “nut rage” incident. In 2016 the group’s container line, Hainjin Shipping, declared bankruptcy. The next year Korean Air managed to stablise its finances by issuing a rights issue worth $390m and by returning to the black. “Water rage” could set the company’s recovery back. But with the competitive threat from state-subsidised Chinese airlines and low-cost carriers from elsewhere in Asia rising every month, the two incidents could turn out to be the least of its big problems ahead.A WOMAN sits at a table, a pen and a sheet of paper in front of her. Out of shot, a man’s voice begins to dictate instructions, which she notes down somewhat sulkily. “Replace ‘my tits’ with ‘my breasts’” he begins. “Remove ‘they could fondle and play with them.’” The injunctions become increasingly bizarre and hilarious. Demands to tone down or remove sexual language are soon joined by embargos on religions, political parties and historical events.

“Do not spread your legs” (2011), Rabih Mroue’s short video, provides a tragicomic window onto Lebanon’s struggles with censorship. Each of the changes requested by the unseen man in the film was taken from a real list of alterations and cuts demanded by censors after Mr Mroue submitted a play script for approval. In accordance with a legislative decree issued in 1977, all theatrical scripts must be submitted to the Bureau of Censorship for review, and they must receive official clearance before they can be staged in public. A law from 1947 requires that television programmes and films also pass the censors’ muster. Flouting the decree can result in a fine, bans and temporary or permanent closure for the institutions involved.

Officially, the bureau is entrusted with banning any work deemed to disrespect religion, disturb the public order, incite sectarianism, offend public sensitivities or insult the dignity of the head of state. They add their own bugbears to that list. Sexually graphic scenes, deemed “immoral”, often end up on the cutting-room floor, as do references to local political parties, explorations of the Lebanese civil war, or anything with a connection to Israel (a more logical boycott given that the two countries have officially been at war since 1948, with periodic outbreaks of fighting since then). As with most censorship, enforcement is inconsistent and unpredictable.

Public awareness of the state’s cultural interference improved in 2012 when March, a local NGO, launched the Virtual Museum of Censorship. By scouring old newspapers and using crowd-sourcing, March was able to create an online database that lists complete or partial bans on books, films, music or TV shows. It is the first public record of censorship, dating back to the 1940s, and it provides valuable insight into the shifting concerns and priorities of the Lebanese state. The data indicate that spikes in censorship usually coincide with political upheaval (see chart), and that censorship has been climbing steadily (though Gino Raidy, vice-president of March, admits that the data-gathering approach means that older examples may have been missed).

From 1950, when censorship starts to be practised regularly, until 1968, most bans relate to material linked to Israel or Judaism, reflecting tense Lebanese-Israeli relations in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Sometimes the boycott extended to artists with no Israeli or Zionist affiliations. “The Milkman” (1950), a slapstick comedy, was banned in Lebanon due to the Jewish origins of Jerry Lewis, the film’s American star.

From 1968 to 1975, amid rising tensions in the run-up to the civil war, the government interfered with works on political and religious grounds. In 1968, Issam Mahfouz’s play “The Dictator”, about a mentally disturbed tyrant who believes himself humanity’s saviour, unsurprisingly fell afoul of censors. Sadeq Jalal Al Azm was arrested in 1970, accused of inciting sectarianism with his book “The Critique of Religious Thought”.

Unsurprisingly, censors clamped down further during the 15 years of conflict. Mr Raidy speculates that censorship would have been more prevalent during this period had there been a stable government to enforce it. Amid the chaos of the war, which saw leaders assassinated and rival governments claiming legitimacy, artists were more likely to be kidnapped than subjected to a state ban, a situation likely to have exacerbated self-censorship. Actors Antoine Kerbage and Elias Elias were both kidnapped during this period, according to March’s data.

While the Taif Agreement and the official end of the civil war in 1990 brought an uneasy peace, censors waged a new battle on culture. Mr Raidy attributes the enormous increase to the state’s emphasis on promoting sectarian unity by preventing discussion of the war. Randa Shahal Al Sabbagh’s film “A Civilised People” (1999), for example, was censored for its depiction of a loving relationship between a Muslim militiaman and a Christian maid during the conflict. “Maybe you could talk about these things during the war, but when the war stopped, you can’t talk about the Palestinian question, you can’t talk about Sunni-Shia relations,” Mr Raidy says.

During the late 1990s, censors sought to stamp out rock and metal music. Dozens of bands, including Black Sabbath and Nirvana, were banned after the Catholic church deemed their music Satanic. The haphazard way these bans were implemented make it hard to pinpoint exact dates, but for several years metal fans were at risk of arrest simply for wearing a band’s T-shirt.

Another significant spike in 2000 marks the year that Israeli forces withdrew from south Lebanon after an occupation lasting 18 years. Yet this period saw censors ban material deemed religiously and politically sensitive and works deemed “immoral” even more than works linked to Israel, which suggests that at times of heightened political tensions censors crack down across the board.

The assassination of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister, and the withdrawal of occupying Syrian troops in 2005 marked the beginning of another steep climb in censorship. The period until 2012 was marked by a series of car bombings and assassinations—and an increase in the frequency of religiously and politically motivated censorship. Increasingly, bans were issued for reasons that appear arbitrary, if not absurd. Lady Gaga’s album “Born This Way” was banned in 2011 on the basis that it is “offensive to Christianity”, due to a track entitled “Judas”. That year the children’s film “Puss in Boots” was banned until the name was changed to “Cat in Boots”.

Sadly, circumstances are not improving. Lebanon’s turbulent history remains particularly taboo, as do Israeli relations (“Wonder Woman” was banned in May 2017, thanks to Gal Gadot, its Israeli star). While censors are increasingly permissive of films with sexual content, growing support for gay and transgender rights has rattled religious authorities and led to a punitive increase in the number of cultural productions banned for portraying non-conforming relationships in a positive light.

Since the onset of the war in Syria and the election of a president in 2016 after a two-year vacuum, Mr Raidy says that censorship has become more prevalent. Not only is it more frequent, but March’s data reveals that the causes of censorship are more diverse than ever before. In the run-up to elections, scheduled for May after a delay of five years, the crackdown is only likely to intensify.ORAL arguments at the Supreme Court often make for excellent theatre: an hour of well-prepared lawyers clashing over an issue fundamental to American democracy, lashed by questions from merciless justices sitting a few feet away. That is what visitors to the Supreme Court are likely to see on April 25th, when the court convenes to hear Trump v Hawaii, the final case of the nine-month term. The justices will consider an uncommonly fraught matter of presidential power: whether the third version of Donald Trump’s restrictions on travel from primarily Muslim countries is consistent with the law and the constitution.

The challengers argue that Mr Trump’s latest travel ban is a direct descendant of his campaign-trail calls for a "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering America "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on”. Singling out members of one religion for especially burdensome treatment based on a hunch that they may be terrorists violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland held, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California said the policy exceeds the president’s authority under a congressional statute: the Immigration and Naturalisation Act.

A willing suspension of disbelief is key to properly experiencing any piece of theatre, and—if Mr Trump is to prevail—the same could go for this week's hearing. Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, will ask the justices to forget everything they think about Mr Trump’s motive for issuing three successive executive orders barring travellers from countries that are overwhelmingly Muslim. The third version is certainly the most refined—it adds Venezuela and North Korea, countries that have few or no Muslims, to the banned list. But to think that Mr Trump no longer intends the travel ban as a partial realisation of his long-promised Muslim ban is to take an exceedingly charitable view of his motives and to ignore his tweets disparaging Muslims.

Courts have no business reviewing a president’s immigration decisions regarding people not “physically present in the United States”, Mr Francisco argues in his final brief to the justices. The ban’s challengers “offer no valid reason to impugn” the executive branch’s “country-specific findings” or to veer away from the so-called “presumption of regularity” and “good faith” of cabinet officials who helped Mr Trump craft the policy.

But an amicus brief written by Robert Loeb and signed by ten former executive branch officials looks to the origins of the “presumption of regularity”, contending that it has never stopped a court from examining “evidence showing that government officials have acted with an improper purpose”. Instead, the idea merely served as a pragmatic cover for presumed facts that were not entirely certain: “if a copy of a document with a corporate seal was filed, a court would presume it was an official corporate seal issued by an authorised party unless someone submitted evidence to the contrary”. But in Trump v Hawaii, Mr Loeb writes, the president’s defenders “seek to inflate this modest presumption into a high barrier thwarting meaningful judicial review”. That refashioning of an old principle “should be squarely rejected”, he writes.

If the justices accept Mr Trump’s assertion that they should simply presume his exercise of presidential power to be lawful and responsible, the former government officials warn, the courts will grant chief executives a dangerously wide berth. The justices may “begin from the premise that government agents have acted properly”, but they do not and should not hesitate from peering “behind the presumption to the actual facts”. Otherwise, a “Jim Crow law designed specifically to disenfranchise black voters” would go unprobed as long as it didn’t mention African Americans by name. Overweening deference to executive power, in short, is not the way of the constitution.

It is telling that the briefs supporting Mr Trump’s immigration decisions expend more energy imploring the justices to look away rather than to carefully examine the justifications and motives behind the travel restrictions. Yes, Mr Trump may have retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda videos from a British hate group in November 2017, but “the President’s retweets do not address the meaning” of the travel ban “at all”. Nor, apparently, does his tweet from June 5th that his “Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version” that became the second version. And there is no reason to consider an August 17th tweet trumpeting a long-discredited story about General John Pershing, in which Mr Trump suggested that stamping out “Radical Islamic Terror” would be a cinch if America would only kill Muslim terrorists with bullets that had been dipped in pig’s blood.

In an attempt to counter the unfortunate record their client has produced, Mr Trump’s lawyers include a footnote pointing to several nice things the president has said about Muslims. In a May 2017 speech in Saudi Arabia, for example, he “praised Islam as ‘one of the world’s great faiths’ and emphasised that the fight against terrorism ‘is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilisations’ ”. And, the brief observes, he repeated this sentiment in a Ramadan message later that month.

White House statements and speeches to foreign governments, of course, are scripted, edited and filtered; Mr Trump’s tweets emphatically are not. But even the Ramadan greeting referred to “barbaric terrorist attacks” in Britain and Egypt and the “perverted ideology” that fuelled them. While Mr Trump noted that these terrorist incidents were “directly contrary to the spirit of Ramadan”, the subtext was not difficult to discern. Mr Trump has conveyed the message that Muslims are dangerous and his travel restrictions are a tool to keep millions of them far from America. His lawyers know that, the justices know that. The question is whether a majority of the justices will bury their heads in the sand and give their blessing to a policy with little—other than religious bigotry—to recommend it. They will rule by the end of June.A ROYAL birth is always heralded with great fanfare, and the arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge’s third baby on April 23rd was no exception. Throngs of reporters waited for updates outside the Lindo Wing, a luxurious private maternity ward in London that has often been used by the royals and which boasts a comprehensive wine list for celebrating parents.

Yet the price of delivering the new prince, who is fifth in line to the British throne, was probably slightly less than that of an average American baby. In 2015, the Lindo Wing charged £5,670 ($8,900) for 24 hours in a deluxe room and a non-Caesarean delivery. A survey in the same year by the International Federation of Health Plans found that the average fee for such a delivery in the United States was $10,808. That rises to roughly $30,000 after accounting for care given before and after a pregnancy, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers cover most of the cost, but parents are still left with an average bill of about $3,000. In many European countries, free maternity care is available.DONALD TRUMP sits down on April 23rd for dinner with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, at the 18th-century mansion at Mount Vernon once owned by George Washington. It is hard to imagine two Western leaders with more contrasting world views. The host, a brash former reality-television host, was elected on a promise to shut borders and spurn multilateralism. The guest, an erudite philosophy graduate, won power by rejecting nationalism and praising Europe and the liberal world order. Yet, against the odds, Mr Macron is the European leader who has done the most to strike up an improbably warm relationship with Mr Trump. Some call him the “Trump whisperer”. But what can Mr Macron really hope to gain from this charm offensive?

Mr Macron does not seek to align himself unconditionally with the American president, although France took part in, and indeed pushed for, recent air strikes with America and Britain against Syrian chemical-weapons stocks. Nor is he after some sort of affectionate relationship, although he seems genuinely to have found a way to relate to Mr Trump, another one-time political outsider. Rather, the French president’s ambition is, at best, to encourage the American leader to use his influence in a more benign way and, at least, to keep him from inflicting real damage. This is why the most pressing matter during the three-day state visit will be to persuade Mr Trump not to walk away from the Iran nuclear agreement on May 12th, as he has threatened to do. Mr Macron will also seek to convince Mr Trump to remain engaged in Syria, both militarily and diplomatically. Other prickly matters under discussion will include trans-Atlantic trade and tariffs, Russia and climate change.

The French seem unusually happy to let Mr Macron make a go of this relationship. They tolerated the way he treated Mr Trump to a grand visit to France last year, complete with a Bastille Day military parade, of the sort that would have been unthinkable for, say, Britain’s Theresa May. But at some point there will be domestic pressure on the French leader to show something in return for all this flattery. Mr Macron has on occasion exaggerated his influence over Mr Trump. But he also knows full well that their differences are great and, at times, insurmountable. The French leader has notably got nowhere in persuading Mr Trump to return to the Paris climate agreement. “Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail,” Mr Macron said earlier this year. In reality, the best the French president may be able to hope for is to tame Mr Trump’s wilder instincts, and keep him at least listening to those inside the Western liberal-democratic club.

A year after his surprise election, and with a robust majority in parliament, Mr Macron still has political capital to spend. His domestic economic policies may not be popular at home, where unions are leading strikes and students holding sit-ins. But a majority of the French like the way he has changed the country’s image abroad. Mr Macron’s talk of grandeur and prestige goes down well, and the prospect of France acting as America’s preferred European interlocutor makes up for reservations the French have about Mr Trump. For now, Mr Macron may look like the smartest European handler of the tricky American president. In the longer run, though, if he cannot secure tangible return for his efforts, he will run the risk of looking naive, or foolish, or both.RECALL how Apple’s reputation took a knock after the firm admitted it had surreptitiously hobbled the performance of peope’s iPhones when their batteries started deteriorating with age. Toyota now faces similar opprobrium for throttling back the batteries of some of its older Prius hybrid cars, to prevent them frying their electronics. The software tweak—performed during a voluntary recall of Priuses sold in America between 2010 and 2014—forces the vehicle to rely more on its petrol engine and less on its electric motor/generators. That causes fuel economy to fall and exhaust emissions to rise. Prius owners, who bought their hybrid vehicles precisely because they were lean and clean, have not been best pleased.



More galling still, reports continue to come in of overheating problems that leave Prius owners in limp-home mode or stranded in traffic unable to move. Online forums (see priuschat.com) have been abuzz with tales of woe from afflicted drivers. Apparently, owners of vehicles that are out of warranty have faced repair estimates of $3,500 or more. Toyota has since extended the warranty of the cars affected, and promised to reimburse those who have been left out-of-pocket.



Even so, the carmaker is now facing litigation over its recall remedy. A lawsuit brought by one of California’s largest Toyota dealers alleges that more than 100 of its customers with Priuses that had already received the software update have returned with the same overheating problem. Toyota disputes the allegations and has sought to have the suit dismissed. A judge has since ruled that the case can go forward, and has set a date for the trial early next year.



The source of the trouble is a box of tricks under the bonnet known as an inverter. This takes the 206-volt direct current (DC) from the Prius’s nickel metal-hydride battery and converts it into the three-phase 500-volt alternating current (AC) needed to drive the car’s two electric motor/generators. (One of these is used to propel the car when operating under battery power, and to assist in recharging the battery when braking; the other’s main job is to keep the battery charged, while supplying supplementary power to the drive assembly, as well as serving as an electric starter for the petrol engine.) Both motor/generators produce mechanical torque when driven by AC electricity—or, when spun backwards by an external source (ie, the hybrid’s petrol engine or the wheels during braking), generate AC electricity.



Managing this merry-go-round is the job of the inverter and its associated electronic-control units. Inside the inverter is a hefty circuit board with a bank of heavy-duty switching components called insulated-gate bipolar transistors. These flip the direction of the DC supply from the battery thousands of times a second, to produce the three-phase AC needed for powering the vehicle’s electric motors. Switching such a heavy current rapidly generates a serious amount of heat. To cope, the inverter has its own glycol-based cooling system.



This all works fine in normal conditions. Occasionally, however, a glitch in the inverter’s software lets matters get out of hand. Microscopic voids then build up in the solder beneath the transistors, causing parts to short-circuit or simply to overheat. Either way, the temperature inside the inverter can rise rapidly. If that temperature becomes excessive, the transistors get fried and the vehicle shuts down completely. More often, the overheating merely causes the current to the inverter to be reduced, the instrument panel to light up like a Christmas tree, and the vehicle to go into limp-home mode while things cool down.



The quick fix adopted by Toyota has been to reset the inverter’s software in order to reduce the likelihood of the transistors being stressed unduly. That has meant lowering the current from the battery and forcing the petrol engine to work harder to compensate—hence the higher fuel consumption and increased exhaust emissions.



The experience has baffled many owners. Online queries have focused on why so complex a contraption as an inverter/converter is needed anyway. Some have even wondered why the Prius uses AC electric motor/generators when perfectly good DC motors and alternators have been around for ages? The presumption is that using a DC motor would allow the vehicle to be powered directly from the battery, obviating the need for an inverter.



Well, not exactly. Electric motors, whether AC or DC, work by causing a magnetic field in the rotating part (rotor) to interact with a magnetic field in the stationary part (stator) of the machine. Magnetic fields can be produced by permanent magnets or by electric currents passing through bundles of wires wrapped around an iron core. Whatever the mechanism, all electric motors, whether their input current is AC or DC, require an alternating current in their stator windings to make their rotors spin.

In a conventional DC motor this AC current is generated by carbon brushes that rub against a split copper ring on the motor’s spindle. As it rotates, this arrangement, called a commutator, chops (ie, rapidly connects and disconnects) the direct current to create a crude form of alternating current. Unfortunately, this causes numerous problems. Friction and electrical arcing at the commutator means the brushes must be replaced regularly. Arcing at the commutator also limits the voltage that can be used, and thus the power produced. And because of the heavy current coursing through a DC motor’s inner windings, the rotor can get extremely hot and become difficult to cool. Conventional DC motors, moreover, require gear boxes because, while huge at start up, the torque they produce falls off rapidly with rotational speed. Finally, DC motors are not particularly good at being run backwards, in order to generate electricity for recharging purposes. At best, they are good for golf carts and fork-lift trucks.

Hence the “brushless” DC motors, with their transistorised switching in place of mechanical brushes and a commutator. These have no brush-related friction or arcing, and control of the current means torque can be controlled without the need for multiple gears. Like other hybrid vehicles, this is what the Prius uses, though it calls them synchronous AC permanent magnet motors. For all intents and purposes, brushless DC motors and synchronous AC motors are essentially the same. Both use permanent magnets embedded in their rotors and both need inverters.

That, though, raises an interesting question. Why not go the whole hog and use the output of the transistors to drive what is known as an AC induction motor? That is what Tesla does. An AC induction motor does not need permanent magnets, and can thus do without the expensive rare-earth metals that are an essential ingredient of modern, high-performance magnets. The answer is that while induction motors are ideal for electric vehicles built for speed (like Teslas), they are not all that efficient when used for pottering around town or cruising lazily down the highway. As cars and lorries tend to spend 90% of their time using little more than 10% of their maximum power, brushless DC motors are a better bet for typical hybrid vehicles like the Prius.DONALD TRUMP was characteristically emphatic: “This is very good news for North Korea and the World—big progress! Look forward to our Summit.” The tweet came on April 20th, shortly after North Korean state media reported that their country would close down the Punggye-ri blast site and stop testing missiles. South Korea also welcomed the move, which comes on the eve of a summit planned for April 27th between Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, with another one scheduled to take place by early June, for Mr Kim and Mr Trump.

Spring is definitely in the air. On April 19th Mr Moon said that the North Korean leader was no longer insisting on the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean peninsula as a precondition for giving up his nuclear weapons. Unlike in previous years, Mr Kim has not issued any condemnations of the military drills that America and South Korea have been performing since the beginning of the month. Nor has he commented on the appointment of John Bolton as Mr Trump’s national security adviser: the North used to denounce him as “human scum” and a “bloodsucker”. By the standards of the North’s vituperative propaganda machine, this is as emollient as it gets.

Nonetheless, there was nothing in Mr Kim’s statement, as reported by the North Korean media, to suggest that the decision was a step towards relinquishing nuclear weapons. On the contrary, Mr Kim said that his country had “verified the completion of nuclear weapons” and that he would halt the tests because they were no longer necessary. Many analysts have been predicting such a moratorium ever since the North announced late last year that it had successfully completed construction of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach America.

Mr Kim’s comments are therefore best read as an attempt to reiterate North Korea’s status as a nuclear state (although analysts are still not quite sure that his scientists have perfected all the components of a long-range nuclear missile). The moratorium might spare Mr Trump and Mr Moon further embarrassment, but it does not necessarily improve the security of America and South Korea. It is telling that Japan, which was already well within range of Mr Kim’s existing weapons stockpile before last year’s round of tests, and has long worried about being left out in the cold during the current round of North Korean diplomacy, reacted more cautiously. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the announcement, but said it was important that it lead to “complete, verifiable denuclearisation”—to which there is still no clear commitment.

Mr Trump has said that he might pull out of the summit if he did not feel it were worth America’s time. But his and Mr Moon’s enthusiastic reaction to Mr Kim’s overtures are ramping up expectations for the meetings. South Korea may be happy with relatively modest results, such as regular talks, a resumption of family reunions and cultural exchanges, and perhaps even a revival of humanitarian aid that does not fall foul of the international sanctions regime against the North. But America’s avowed and only aim is to get Mr Kim to give up his nukes. If Mr Trump goes into his pow-wow expecting a quick win, only to find that the North Korean leader’s friendliness does not stretch that far, the mood may sour alarmingly.THERE was once no brighter star in Europe. Since shaking off communism in 1989 Poland has rivalled the bounciest Asian tigers in GDP growth. It has become a vital NATO ally. But it is also on the front line of what France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, calls a “European civil war” over the rule of law.

The optimism that attended the EU’s great eastward expansion in 2004 has given way, in some places, to angry, nationalist “illiberal democracy”. In Hungary, having nobbled the courts, media and public prosecutor, Viktor Orban is squeezing civil society and using state (and EU) funds to nurture oligarchs. Romania’s leaders endlessly seek to weaken anti-graft laws that might otherwise ensnare them.

But the gravest challenge is in Poland. Since taking office in 2015 the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has stacked the courts, skewed public media and stuffed the bureaucracy with supporters (see article). Its judicial reforms flagrantly violate EU treaties. That matters not only for Polish democracy: EU countries have to trust each other’s courts to uphold the law that underpins the single market. So last year the European Commission invoked Article 7, an untested instrument that obliges governments to assess whether one of them is systematically undermining the rule of law.

In theory Article 7 can strip an offending country of its EU voting rights. In practice the unanimous vote that it requires is impossible to secure, partly because illiberal governments protect each other. So the commission is eyeing the EU budget, much of which is spent on transfers from rich countries to poorer ones. The last seven-year budget granted Poland nearly one-fifth of the EU’s cohesion funds. That looks like leverage.

Negotiations over the next budget begin in May. It can be harnessed in two ways. One, other member states can take a tough line with Poland in the haggling ahead. Parliaments in countries like Germany and the Netherlands already find it galling to send so much of their taxpayers’ cash to governments that flout the rules. A second idea is to establish a way to suspend payments to governments that violate the rule of law.

The EU faces a dilemma. Go soft on PiS’s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and Europe’s next would-be autocrat will be emboldened. But pushing too hard risks bolstering PiS’s claim that meddling outsiders are undermining Polish democracy. As the giant of eastern Europe, Poland matters. The EU’s growing east-west cleavages over migration and money cannot be healed if it is sent out into the cold.

A flicker of hope

Perhaps prodded into action by the coming budgetary talks, PiS has lately tweaked some of its judicial reforms. The changes, on matters like judges’ retirement ages, are the first signs of compromise since 2015. But they are largely cosmetic. The EU should (quietly) insist on much more before it considers lifting Article 7. Poland’s rulers must take steps to revive the rule of law, starting with the restoration of improperly fired judges on the constitutional tribunal. If PiS does not budge, the commission should be creative with the budget. Poland receives three times as much from EU funds as it pays in, and those subsidies go disproportionately to PiS’s rural supporters. They need to understand that they cannot enjoy the benefits of a club at the same time as they trample on its rules.

This week Mr Macron repeated his call for a “hard core” of EU countries to pursue integration if others ignore their commitments. Poland’s government says it does not want to be left behind in Europe’s slow lane. But if it continues to undermine independent institutions and violate the rule of law, that is what will happen.IN CASE anyone should think American white evangelicals are actually in favour of extra-marital affairs with porn stars, Robert Jeffress, a well-known pastor from Texas, offered a helpful explainer last month. “Evangelicals still believe in the commandment, Thou shall not have sex with a porn star”, he told Fox News. “However, whether this president violated that commandment or not is totally irrelevant to our support of him.”

It was useful to have this cleared this up. Since Stephanie Clifford, a porn star who is also known as Stormy Daniels, alleged that she had had a sexual tryst with Donald Trump only months after his third wife gave birth, the president appears to have become even more popular among white evangelicals than he was before. A survey by Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), published this week, suggests support among white evangelicals for Mr Trump is, at 75%, at the highest level ever recorded.

That is much higher than the president’s 42% approval rating among the general population. It is also represents a fairly steady recent increase in white evangelicals’ support for Mr Trump. Less than half backed him during the Republican primaries, in 2016. But since Mr Trump became president their support has not dropped below 65%. Robert Jones, chief executive of PRRI, said that fits a familiar established pattern: evangelicals tend to cluster behind whoever emerges as the Republican candidate in a given race—and cluster even more forcefully when that candidate wins office.

But it seems remarkable that white evangelicals could be so unfazed by Mr Trump’s latest scandals. Last month, Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against the president in an effort to be free of a hush agreement she had signed with his attorney. Also last month, a former Playboy model called Karen McDougal gave a television interview in which she described an alleged 10-month-long affair with Mr Trump in 2006 (which was also the year of his alleged tryst with Ms Clifford). Ms McDougal claimed that the president had offered her money after their first sexual encounter and that she ended the affair because she became consumed with guilt about his adultery. The White House has denied that Mr Trump had the alleged affairs.

Perverse though it seems, it is no coincidence that the president’s popularity with white evangelicals has increased amid these scandals. White evangelicals are a fading force in American politics and society and Mr Trump has cast himself as their defender. So when he comes under attack, they consider themselves to be under attack too.

A PRRI survey conducted last year found the proportion of Americans who are white evangelicals had fallen to 17%, from 23% in 2006. The intervening years featured another development, the introduction of gay marriage, which for many conservative Christians is both emblematic of their decline and exceptionally aggravating. Mr Trump has signalled his sympathy for such cultural fears by vowing to exclude transgender people from the armed forces. He has also aligned himself firmly with the pro-life movement, including by addressing an annual anti-abortion march in Washington and appointing conservative judges. The aggressive manner in which he has claimed to be leading a counter-cultural pushback seems to go down with white evangelicals especially well. “Trump is like the boy who punches the bully in the playground”, says Mr Jones. “They like that”.

A longstanding idea that white evangelicals are most concerned about the moral character of their leader has, in the process, gone out the window. In a recent interview with Politico Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, an influential Christian campaign group, said Mr Trump’s relationship with evangelicals was transactional. He suggested evangelicals had got much out of the deal, with Mr Trump delivering more on policy, “than any other president in my lifetime.”

This is a big reason why Mr Trump’s approval ratings have stayed remarkably steady, despite the many scandals buffeting his administration. Evangelicals are one of the biggest segments of his coalition and they are going nowhere. The PRRI survey also found that 69% of white evangelical Protestants who identify with or lean towards the Republican Party would prefer Donald Trump over any other candidate to be the party’s presidential nominee in 2020.BILLIONS of dollars and long-standing interstate e-commerce rules are at stake in a case that came before the justices on April 17th. The case revisits an old Supreme Court rule that retailers shipping goods to states where they have no physical presence cannot be forced to collect sales tax from their customers. This standard is outdated, South Dakota's attorney-general told the justices, and deprives states of “massive sales tax revenues that we need for education, healthcare and infrastructure”.

The conflict in South Dakota v Wayfair Inc arose in 2016 when the Midwestern state noticed that more of its residents were shopping online. In defiance of a quarter-century-old Supreme Court precedent, South Dakota tried to shore up its declining revenues by imposing sales-tax collection on far-flung stores doing more than $100,000 of business, or conducting more than 200 transactions, in the state.

When the conflict hit the lower courts, South Dakota’s law was struck down as a violation of the constitution’s Commerce Clause in line with Quill v North Dakota, a 1992 ruling. But the state pinned its hopes on Justice Anthony Kennedy’s comment in 2015 that Quill was “doubtful” and ripe for reconsideration. “[D]ramatic technological and social changes” in America’s economy, he wrote, along with “startling” state budget shortfalls, cast the Quill-mandated sales-tax regime in a less appealing light.

It would take five justices to overrule Quill and permit states to force out-of-state retailers to step up and collect tax. Going into the hearing, conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Kennedy all seemed inclined to do that. The oral argument added a surprise fourth justice to that list: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court's fiercest liberal. In her questioning of George Isaacson, the lawyer for several online stores including Wayfair, a homewares company, she repeatedly called Quill “obsolete”. Requiring an “out-of-state seller to collect tax on goods shipped in-state” is “equalising sellers”, she said.

In response, Mr Isaacson said the Commerce Clause seeks to ensure a “single national marketplace that is free and accessible to all participants”. When the court first weighed in on the question in 1967, America had 2300 different sales-tax jurisdictions. That number rose to 6000 by the time Quill was decided and stands at over 12,000 today. So any store selling wares over the web would face the onerous task of calculating various items’ precise tax rates for countless addresses across the country. Smaller retailers may not be up to the task.

Exactly how burdensome and expensive the accounting might be is a matter of dispute. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to one brief claiming the cost would be as high as $250,000; the lawyer for South Dakota said it would be closer to “$12 a month for 30 transactions”. Online software companies filed a friend-of-the-court brief touting services like TaxCloud and WooCommerce that might do the job for free—but when Wayfair and the other retailers tested these websites, they quickly found them “rife with errors”.

These and other conflicting claims seemed to befuddle Justice Stephen Breyer, who may hold the key vote. “When I read your briefs, I thought absolutely right”, he told the lawyer for South Dakota. “And then I read through the other briefs, and I thought, absolutely right. And you cannot both be absolutely right.”

The justices also pointed to disparate predictions of how much states stand to gain if the court abandons Quill. South Dakota says it would reap another $50m in tax revenues through its 2016 law and that other states would see increases totaling $34bn, whereas the companies cite Government Accountability Office estimates closer to $8-13bn. Whatever the figure, a lot of tax dollars, and a big consumer perk, are on the line when the Supreme Court hands down its decision in May or June.IN THE days when the Silk Road linked China to Europe, merchants would crisscross Eurasia, stopping at the caravanserais that had sprouted up across Central Asia and the southern Caucasus. But as trade came to rely more on shipping, land routes fell out of favour and many Eurasian hubs floundered. A stream of projects launched in 2013 by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, may change that. The so-called “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI) aims to improve trading and transport links between China and the world, mostly through infrastructure investments. It promises to revive the fortunes of ex-Soviet states. But what do these countries stand to gain from a flow of what will be predominantly Chinese goods?

The scale of the initiative is enormous. So far China is estimated to have underwritten over $900bn of loans—some on concessionary terms, many on commercial terms—in 71 countries, ranging from Poland to Pakistan. Many projects are under way. Kazakhstan has opened a massive dry port on its eastern border with China. Its seaports on the Caspian sea are also being expanded, and east-west rail and road connections are being upgraded. On the other side of the Caspian, Azerbaijan and Georgia hope to capture some of the flow of Chinese goods to Europe via the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway, which opened last year, and Georgia has secured $50m in Chinese investment in a proposed deep-sea port on the Black Sea. Other countries are jockeying to attract Chinese attention for BRI projects. Last November the Georgian government held its second biennial Tbilisi Belt and Road Forum, in which delegations from Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia presented historical trade route maps as part of their efforts to earn a place on this 21st-century Silk Road, with all the accompanying Chinese investment.

Underlying such machinations lies the assumption that the BRI will deliver a host of lucrative spillover effects to the transit countries. Many have underdeveloped or poorly maintained infrastructure. The economic benefits of a new motorway, railway or port for the hospitality, industrial or retail sectors seem clear enough. Such developments should make trading between neighbours easier—something that Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have already been taking advantage of. And governments like to take credit for shiny new infrastructure projects without having to raise revenue to pay for them or subject themselves to conditions set by Western investors or multilateral organisations.

But worries persist. China supplies the workers to carry out the projects, limiting the scope for local involvement. Transit countries are likely to keep trade tariffs to a minimum to stop China using different, cheaper routes for its goods, but this limits opportunities to raise revenue. Furthermore, BRI countries claim that their nascent manufacturing sectors can be integrated into the Chinese value chain so that, for example, machine parts made in China could be assembled in Kazakhstan. But manufacturing sectors across the former Soviet Union are uncompetitive and businesses complain of shortages of skilled labour. Most worryingly, perhaps, countries along the route are already heavily indebted. If the returns on BRI investment prove underwhelming, they could struggle to repay China’s loans and to pay for maintenance, and bilateral relations could sour. This modern Silk Road might end up being less renowned for the spread of prosperity than its forebear.ORAL arguments at the Supreme Court often make for excellent theatre: an hour of well-prepared lawyers clashing over an issue fundamental to American democracy, lashed by questions from merciless justices sitting a few feet away. That is what visitors to the Supreme Court are likely to see on April 25th, when the court convenes to hear Trump v Hawaii, the final case of the nine-month term. The justices will consider an uncommonly fraught matter of presidential power: whether the third version of Donald Trump’s restrictions on travel from primarily Muslim countries is consistent with the law and the constitution.

The challengers argue that Mr Trump’s latest travel ban is a direct descendant of his campaign-trail calls for a "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering America "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on”. Singling out members of one religion for especially burdensome treatment based on a hunch that they may be terrorists violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland held, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California said the policy exceeds the president’s authority under a congressional statute: the Immigration and Naturalisation Act.

A willing suspension of disbelief is key to properly experiencing any piece of theatre, and—if Mr Trump is to prevail—the same could go for this week's hearing. Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, will ask the justices to forget everything they think about Mr Trump’s motive for issuing three successive executive orders barring travellers from countries that are overwhelmingly Muslim. The third version is certainly the most refined—it adds Venezuela and North Korea, countries that have few or no Muslims, to the banned list. But to think that Mr Trump no longer intends the travel ban as a partial realisation of his long-promised Muslim ban is to take an exceedingly charitable view of his motives and to ignore his tweets disparaging Muslims.

Courts have no business reviewing a president’s immigration decisions regarding people not “physically present in the United States”, Mr Francisco argues in his final brief to the justices. The ban’s challengers “offer no valid reason to impugn” the executive branch’s “country-specific findings” or to veer away from the so-called “presumption of regularity” and “good faith” of cabinet officials who helped Mr Trump craft the policy.

But an amicus brief written by Robert Loeb and signed by ten former executive branch officials looks to the origins of the “presumption of regularity”, contending that it has never stopped a court from examining “evidence showing that government officials have acted with an improper purpose”. Instead, the idea merely served as a pragmatic cover for presumed facts that were not entirely certain: “if a copy of a document with a corporate seal was filed, a court would presume it was an official corporate seal issued by an authorised party unless someone submitted evidence to the contrary”. But in Trump v Hawaii, Mr Loeb writes, the president’s defenders “seek to inflate this modest presumption into a high barrier thwarting meaningful judicial review”. That refashioning of an old principle “should be squarely rejected”, he writes.

If the justices accept Mr Trump’s assertion that they should simply presume his exercise of presidential power to be lawful and responsible, the former government officials warn, the courts will grant chief executives a dangerously wide berth. The justices may “begin from the premise that government agents have acted properly”, but they do not and should not hesitate from peering “behind the presumption to the actual facts”. Otherwise, a “Jim Crow law designed specifically to disenfranchise black voters” would go unprobed as long as it didn’t mention African Americans by name. Overweening deference to executive power, in short, is not the way of the constitution.

It is telling that the briefs supporting Mr Trump’s immigration decisions expend more energy imploring the justices to look away rather than to carefully examine the justifications and motives behind the travel restrictions. Yes, Mr Trump may have retweeted anti-Muslim propaganda videos from a British hate group in November 2017, but “the President’s retweets do not address the meaning” of the travel ban “at all”. Nor, apparently, does his tweet from June 5th that his “Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version” that became the second version. And there is no reason to consider an August 17th tweet trumpeting a long-discredited story about General John Pershing, in which Mr Trump suggested that stamping out “Radical Islamic Terror” would be a cinch if America would only kill Muslim terrorists with bullets that had been dipped in pig’s blood.

In an attempt to counter the unfortunate record their client has produced, Mr Trump’s lawyers include a footnote pointing to several nice things the president has said about Muslims. In a May 2017 speech in Saudi Arabia, for example, he “praised Islam as ‘one of the world’s great faiths’ and emphasised that the fight against terrorism ‘is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilisations’ ”. And, the brief observes, he repeated this sentiment in a Ramadan message later that month.

White House statements and speeches to foreign governments, of course, are scripted, edited and filtered; Mr Trump’s tweets emphatically are not. But even the Ramadan greeting referred to “barbaric terrorist attacks” in Britain and Egypt and the “perverted ideology” that fuelled them. While Mr Trump noted that these terrorist incidents were “directly contrary to the spirit of Ramadan”, the subtext was not difficult to discern. Mr Trump has conveyed the message that Muslims are dangerous and his travel restrictions are a tool to keep millions of them far from America. His lawyers know that, the justices know that. The question is whether a majority of the justices will bury their heads in the sand and give their blessing to a policy with little—other than religious bigotry—to recommend it. They will rule by the end of June.DONALD TRUMP sits down on April 23rd for dinner with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, at the 18th-century mansion at Mount Vernon once owned by George Washington. It is hard to imagine two Western leaders with more contrasting world views. The host, a brash former reality-television host, was elected on a promise to shut borders and spurn multilateralism. The guest, an erudite philosophy graduate, won power by rejecting nationalism and praising Europe and the liberal world order. Yet, against the odds, Mr Macron is the European leader who has done the most to strike up an improbably warm relationship with Mr Trump. Some call him the “Trump whisperer”. But what can Mr Macron really hope to gain from this charm offensive?

Mr Macron does not seek to align himself unconditionally with the American president, although France took part in, and indeed pushed for, recent air strikes with America and Britain against Syrian chemical-weapons stocks. Nor is he after some sort of affectionate relationship, although he seems genuinely to have found a way to relate to Mr Trump, another one-time political outsider. Rather, the French president’s ambition is, at best, to encourage the American leader to use his influence in a more benign way and, at least, to keep him from inflicting real damage. This is why the most pressing matter during the three-day state visit will be to persuade Mr Trump not to walk away from the Iran nuclear agreement on May 12th, as he has threatened to do. Mr Macron will also seek to convince Mr Trump to remain engaged in Syria, both militarily and diplomatically. Other prickly matters under discussion will include trans-Atlantic trade and tariffs, Russia and climate change.

The French seem unusually happy to let Mr Macron make a go of this relationship. They tolerated the way he treated Mr Trump to a grand visit to France last year, complete with a Bastille Day military parade, of the sort that would have been unthinkable for, say, Britain’s Theresa May. But at some point there will be domestic pressure on the French leader to show something in return for all this flattery. Mr Macron has on occasion exaggerated his influence over Mr Trump. But he also knows full well that their differences are great and, at times, insurmountable. The French leader has notably got nowhere in persuading Mr Trump to return to the Paris climate agreement. “Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail,” Mr Macron said earlier this year. In reality, the best the French president may be able to hope for is to tame Mr Trump’s wilder instincts, and keep him at least listening to those inside the Western liberal-democratic club.

A year after his surprise election, and with a robust majority in parliament, Mr Macron still has political capital to spend. His domestic economic policies may not be popular at home, where unions are leading strikes and students holding sit-ins. But a majority of the French like the way he has changed the country’s image abroad. Mr Macron’s talk of grandeur and prestige goes down well, and the prospect of France acting as America’s preferred European interlocutor makes up for reservations the French have about Mr Trump. For now, Mr Macron may look like the smartest European handler of the tricky American president. In the longer run, though, if he cannot secure tangible return for his efforts, he will run the risk of looking naive, or foolish, or both.IF THE cruise missiles that slammed into Syria on April 14th rattled President Bashar al-Assad, he did his best not to show it. Hours after America, Britain and France struck three facilities connected to Mr Assad’s chemical-weapons programme, his office posted a video of him strolling confidently into work. Russian politicians who met him later in the day said he was in a good mood.

Mr Assad may have feared a bigger response from the West. Donald Trump, America’s president, had vowed to make his regime pay a “big price” for gassing to death more than 40 people in the town of Douma on April 7th. But the missiles destroyed only a handful of buildings and probably failed to wipe out all of Mr Assad’s poisonous arsenal. Nor did they dent his ability to rout, with conventional weapons, what is left of the rebellion in Syria’s seven-year civil war.

Aided by Iran and Russia, Mr Assad is winning the war. His soldiers recently captured Eastern Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus of which Douma is part, after a brutal weeks-long offensive. Hours after the chemical attack, the only rebels still standing in the area agreed to the terms of a Russian-brokered surrender. Some handed over their weapons and will join the regime’s security forces; others were bused north to Idlib province.

Now the regime’s forces are massing on the edge of Yarmouk, another suburb of Damascus that is occupied by Islamic State (IS). Some of the jihadists have already fled. The rest will either surrender, cut a deal or fight a battle they will lose, say analysts. A similar fate awaits rebel groups that control a small adjacent area. Russia wants them to reconcile with the regime and join the fight against IS.

Rebels in other parts of the Syrian interior are also on the ropes. Cut off from international support, those still in control of towns near Homs have tried to strike a deal with Russia that would allow them to stay in the area. But Mr Assad, who has vowed to retake the entire country, is unlikely to tolerate their presence on the main highway that runs north from Damascus. “I can see every remaining rebel pocket in the centre of the country falling in the next few months,” says Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank in London.

What happens in the last big rebel strongholds, on the country’s borders, is harder to predict. In the south, where a fragile ceasefire holds, Mr Assad would need Russian and Iranian help to defeat the rebels quickly. But relying too heavily on Iran and its proxies risks provoking Israel, which has already struck Iranian bases in Syria. Jordan, which has backed the rebels, would probably tolerate the regime’s return to its border if it didn’t lead to a new wave of refugees. The war has hurt Jordan’s economy; it just wants it over.

In the north, where a separate ceasefire is in effect, the situation is even more complicated. Rebels control much of Idlib, home to 2m people. The most powerful groups are led by jihadists. Al-Qaeda has 300 or so fighters in the area, but they are lightly armed and widely reviled. Vicious infighting among the rebels has delighted the regime.

Idlib poses a dilemma for Mr Assad and his allies. The province is guarded by Turkish soldiers, who are monitoring the ceasefire. If, as expected, the regime attacks, its forces would need to confront or skirt Turkey’s bases. Some think the Turks would cede some territory to prevent a full-scale assault on Idlib. Much depends on whether Russia, which is working with Turkey to negotiate an end to the war, would support an offensive deep into the province’s densely populated areas.

Mr Trump, for his part, has said he wants to withdraw American troops from Syria, where they are fighting IS alongside Kurdish-led forces in the north-east. There is talk of replacing the Americans with an Arab force, which the regime has promised to fight. The war may become still more complicated.FOUR years ago, Cho Hyun-ah, an executive at Korean Air made headlines around the world when she threw a fit because she was served macadamia nuts in their packaging rather than on a serving dish in first class on the airline. She reportedly insulted the cabin crew, threw documents at them, and forced them to kneel and beg forgiveness. At the time, she was a company vice president, and she made the plane return to its gate in order to remove the offending flight attendant. After spending several months in prison for breaking aviation-safety laws, Cho Hyun-Ah was able to return to her father’s conglomerate, this time managing hotels rather than Korean Air. But a new scandal may have finally accomplished what “nut rage” could not.

This month, police opened an investigation into Hyun-ah’s younger sister, Hyun-min, a marketing executive at Korean Air. It was alleged that she had thrown water at an advertising executive’s face during a business meeting. She apologised for her behaviour and claimed that she had thrown water on the floor, not in the other executive’s face. Cho Yang-ho, their father and chair of Korean Air, apologised on April 22nd for the behaviour of two of his daughters and announced that they would leave their management positions at the company.

In the end, Mr Cho may have had little choice but to remove his daughters from the company. Investigators raided the family’s homes and offices this month. And the company has grown so unpopular that some Koreans have called on their country’s government to stop the airline from using “Korean” in its name. “As chairman of Korean Air, as well as a father, I feel terrible about the immature actions of my daughters,” Mr Cho said in a statement. “Everything is my fault and my wrongdoing. I apologise to the people.”

The row comes at a bad time for Mr Cho’s family conglomerate, the Hainjin Group, which is recovering from several years of bad news. Korean Air had made several years of losses before and after the first “nut rage” incident. In 2016 the group’s container line, Hainjin Shipping, declared bankruptcy. The next year Korean Air managed to stablise its finances by issuing a rights issue worth $390m and by returning to the black. “Water rage” could set the company’s recovery back. But with the competitive threat from state-subsidised Chinese airlines and low-cost carriers from elsewhere in Asia rising every month, the two incidents could turn out to be the least of its big problems ahead.A WOMAN sits at a table, a pen and a sheet of paper in front of her. Out of shot, a man’s voice begins to dictate instructions, which she notes down somewhat sulkily. “Replace ‘my tits’ with ‘my breasts’” he begins. “Remove ‘they could fondle and play with them.’” The injunctions become increasingly bizarre and hilarious. Demands to tone down or remove sexual language are soon joined by embargos on religions, political parties and historical events.

“Do not spread your legs” (2011), Rabih Mroue’s short video, provides a tragicomic window onto Lebanon’s struggles with censorship. Each of the changes requested by the unseen man in the film was taken from a real list of alterations and cuts demanded by censors after Mr Mroue submitted a play script for approval. In accordance with a legislative decree issued in 1977, all theatrical scripts must be submitted to the Bureau of Censorship for review, and they must receive official clearance before they can be staged in public. A law from 1947 requires that television programmes and films also pass the censors’ muster. Flouting the decree can result in a fine, bans and temporary or permanent closure for the institutions involved.

Officially, the bureau is entrusted with banning any work deemed to disrespect religion, disturb the public order, incite sectarianism, offend public sensitivities or insult the dignity of the head of state. They add their own bugbears to that list. Sexually graphic scenes, deemed “immoral”, often end up on the cutting-room floor, as do references to local political parties, explorations of the Lebanese civil war, or anything with a connection to Israel (a more logical boycott given that the two countries have officially been at war since 1948, with periodic outbreaks of fighting since then). As with most censorship, enforcement is inconsistent and unpredictable.

Public awareness of the state’s cultural interference improved in 2012 when March, a local NGO, launched the Virtual Museum of Censorship. By scouring old newspapers and using crowd-sourcing, March was able to create an online database that lists complete or partial bans on books, films, music or TV shows. It is the first public record of censorship, dating back to the 1940s, and it provides valuable insight into the shifting concerns and priorities of the Lebanese state. The data indicate that spikes in censorship usually coincide with political upheaval (see chart), and that censorship has been climbing steadily (though Gino Raidy, vice-president of March, admits that the data-gathering approach means that older examples may have been missed).

From 1950, when censorship starts to be practised regularly, until 1968, most bans relate to material linked to Israel or Judaism, reflecting tense Lebanese-Israeli relations in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Sometimes the boycott extended to artists with no Israeli or Zionist affiliations. “The Milkman” (1950), a slapstick comedy, was banned in Lebanon due to the Jewish origins of Jerry Lewis, the film’s American star.

From 1968 to 1975, amid rising tensions in the run-up to the civil war, the government interfered with works on political and religious grounds. In 1968, Issam Mahfouz’s play “The Dictator”, about a mentally disturbed tyrant who believes himself humanity’s saviour, unsurprisingly fell afoul of censors. Sadeq Jalal Al Azm was arrested in 1970, accused of inciting sectarianism with his book “The Critique of Religious Thought”.

Unsurprisingly, censors clamped down further during the 15 years of conflict. Mr Raidy speculates that censorship would have been more prevalent during this period had there been a stable government to enforce it. Amid the chaos of the war, which saw leaders assassinated and rival governments claiming legitimacy, artists were more likely to be kidnapped than subjected to a state ban, a situation likely to have exacerbated self-censorship. Actors Antoine Kerbage and Elias Elias were both kidnapped during this period, according to March’s data.

While the Taif Agreement and the official end of the civil war in 1990 brought an uneasy peace, censors waged a new battle on culture. Mr Raidy attributes the enormous increase to the state’s emphasis on promoting sectarian unity by preventing discussion of the war. Randa Shahal Al Sabbagh’s film “A Civilised People” (1999), for example, was censored for its depiction of a loving relationship between a Muslim militiaman and a Christian maid during the conflict. “Maybe you could talk about these things during the war, but when the war stopped, you can’t talk about the Palestinian question, you can’t talk about Sunni-Shia relations,” Mr Raidy says.

During the late 1990s, censors sought to stamp out rock and metal music. Dozens of bands, including Black Sabbath and Nirvana, were banned after the Catholic church deemed their music Satanic. The haphazard way these bans were implemented make it hard to pinpoint exact dates, but for several years metal fans were at risk of arrest simply for wearing a band’s T-shirt.

Another significant spike in 2000 marks the year that Israeli forces withdrew from south Lebanon after an occupation lasting 18 years. Yet this period saw censors ban material deemed religiously and politically sensitive and works deemed “immoral” even more than works linked to Israel, which suggests that at times of heightened political tensions censors crack down across the board.

The assassination of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister, and the withdrawal of occupying Syrian troops in 2005 marked the beginning of another steep climb in censorship. The period until 2012 was marked by a series of car bombings and assassinations—and an increase in the frequency of religiously and politically motivated censorship. Increasingly, bans were issued for reasons that appear arbitrary, if not absurd. Lady Gaga’s album “Born This Way” was banned in 2011 on the basis that it is “offensive to Christianity”, due to a track entitled “Judas”. That year the children’s film “Puss in Boots” was banned until the name was changed to “Cat in Boots”.

Sadly, circumstances are not improving. Lebanon’s turbulent history remains particularly taboo, as do Israeli relations (“Wonder Woman” was banned in May 2017, thanks to Gal Gadot, its Israeli star). While censors are increasingly permissive of films with sexual content, growing support for gay and transgender rights has rattled religious authorities and led to a punitive increase in the number of cultural productions banned for portraying non-conforming relationships in a positive light.

Since the onset of the war in Syria and the election of a president in 2016 after a two-year vacuum, Mr Raidy says that censorship has become more prevalent. Not only is it more frequent, but March’s data reveals that the causes of censorship are more diverse than ever before. In the run-up to elections, scheduled for May after a delay of five years, the crackdown is only likely to intensify.A ROYAL birth is always heralded with great fanfare, and the arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge’s third baby on April 23rd was no exception. Throngs of reporters waited for updates outside the Lindo Wing, a luxurious private maternity ward in London that has often been used by the royals and which boasts a comprehensive wine list for celebrating parents.

Yet the price of delivering the new prince, who is fifth in line to the British throne, was probably slightly less than that of an average American baby. In 2015, the Lindo Wing charged £5,670 ($8,900) for 24 hours in a deluxe room and a non-Caesarean delivery. A survey in the same year by the International Federation of Health Plans found that the average fee for such a delivery in the United States was $10,808. That rises to roughly $30,000 after accounting for care given before and after a pregnancy, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers cover most of the cost, but parents are still left with an average bill of about $3,000. In many European countries, free maternity care is available.RECALL how Apple’s reputation took a knock after the firm admitted it had surreptitiously hobbled the performance of peope’s iPhones when their batteries started deteriorating with age. Toyota now faces similar opprobrium for throttling back the batteries of some of its older Prius hybrid cars, to prevent them frying their electronics. The software tweak—performed during a voluntary recall of Priuses sold in America between 2010 and 2014—forces the vehicle to rely more on its petrol engine and less on its electric motor/generators. That causes fuel economy to fall and exhaust emissions to rise. Prius owners, who bought their hybrid vehicles precisely because they were lean and clean, have not been best pleased.



More galling still, reports continue to come in of overheating problems that leave Prius owners in limp-home mode or stranded in traffic unable to move. Online forums (see priuschat.com) have been abuzz with tales of woe from afflicted drivers. Apparently, owners of vehicles that are out of warranty have faced repair estimates of $3,500 or more. Toyota has since extended the warranty of the cars affected, and promised to reimburse those who have been left out-of-pocket.



Even so, the carmaker is now facing litigation over its recall remedy. A lawsuit brought by one of California’s largest Toyota dealers alleges that more than 100 of its customers with Priuses that had already received the software update have returned with the same overheating problem. Toyota disputes the allegations and has sought to have the suit dismissed. A judge has since ruled that the case can go forward, and has set a date for the trial early next year.



The source of the trouble is a box of tricks under the bonnet known as an inverter. This takes the 206-volt direct current (DC) from the Prius’s nickel metal-hydride battery and converts it into the three-phase 500-volt alternating current (AC) needed to drive the car’s two electric motor/generators. (One of these is used to propel the car when operating under battery power, and to assist in recharging the battery when braking; the other’s main job is to keep the battery charged, while supplying supplementary power to the drive assembly, as well as serving as an electric starter for the petrol engine.) Both motor/generators produce mechanical torque when driven by AC electricity—or, when spun backwards by an external source (ie, the hybrid’s petrol engine or the wheels during braking), generate AC electricity.



Managing this merry-go-round is the job of the inverter and its associated electronic-control units. Inside the inverter is a hefty circuit board with a bank of heavy-duty switching components called insulated-gate bipolar transistors. These flip the direction of the DC supply from the battery thousands of times a second, to produce the three-phase AC needed for powering the vehicle’s electric motors. Switching such a heavy current rapidly generates a serious amount of heat. To cope, the inverter has its own glycol-based cooling system.



This all works fine in normal conditions. Occasionally, however, a glitch in the inverter’s software lets matters get out of hand. Microscopic voids then build up in the solder beneath the transistors, causing parts to short-circuit or simply to overheat. Either way, the temperature inside the inverter can rise rapidly. If that temperature becomes excessive, the transistors get fried and the vehicle shuts down completely. More often, the overheating merely causes the current to the inverter to be reduced, the instrument panel to light up like a Christmas tree, and the vehicle to go into limp-home mode while things cool down.



The quick fix adopted by Toyota has been to reset the inverter’s software in order to reduce the likelihood of the transistors being stressed unduly. That has meant lowering the current from the battery and forcing the petrol engine to work harder to compensate—hence the higher fuel consumption and increased exhaust emissions.



The experience has baffled many owners. Online queries have focused on why so complex a contraption as an inverter/converter is needed anyway. Some have even wondered why the Prius uses AC electric motor/generators when perfectly good DC motors and alternators have been around for ages? The presumption is that using a DC motor would allow the vehicle to be powered directly from the battery, obviating the need for an inverter.



Well, not exactly. Electric motors, whether AC or DC, work by causing a magnetic field in the rotating part (rotor) to interact with a magnetic field in the stationary part (stator) of the machine. Magnetic fields can be produced by permanent magnets or by electric currents passing through bundles of wires wrapped around an iron core. Whatever the mechanism, all electric motors, whether their input current is AC or DC, require an alternating current in their stator windings to make their rotors spin.

In a conventional DC motor this AC current is generated by carbon brushes that rub against a split copper ring on the motor’s spindle. As it rotates, this arrangement, called a commutator, chops (ie, rapidly connects and disconnects) the direct current to create a crude form of alternating current. Unfortunately, this causes numerous problems. Friction and electrical arcing at the commutator means the brushes must be replaced regularly. Arcing at the commutator also limits the voltage that can be used, and thus the power produced. And because of the heavy current coursing through a DC motor’s inner windings, the rotor can get extremely hot and become difficult to cool. Conventional DC motors, moreover, require gear boxes because, while huge at start up, the torque they produce falls off rapidly with rotational speed. Finally, DC motors are not particularly good at being run backwards, in order to generate electricity for recharging purposes. At best, they are good for golf carts and fork-lift trucks.

Hence the “brushless” DC motors, with their transistorised switching in place of mechanical brushes and a commutator. These have no brush-related friction or arcing, and control of the current means torque can be controlled without the need for multiple gears. Like other hybrid vehicles, this is what the Prius uses, though it calls them synchronous AC permanent magnet motors. For all intents and purposes, brushless DC motors and synchronous AC motors are essentially the same. Both use permanent magnets embedded in their rotors and both need inverters.

That, though, raises an interesting question. Why not go the whole hog and use the output of the transistors to drive what is known as an AC induction motor? That is what Tesla does. An AC induction motor does not need permanent magnets, and can thus do without the expensive rare-earth metals that are an essential ingredient of modern, high-performance magnets. The answer is that while induction motors are ideal for electric vehicles built for speed (like Teslas), they are not all that efficient when used for pottering around town or cruising lazily down the highway. As cars and lorries tend to spend 90% of their time using little more than 10% of their maximum power, brushless DC motors are a better bet for typical hybrid vehicles like the Prius.DONALD TRUMP was characteristically emphatic: “This is very good news for North Korea and the World—big progress! Look forward to our Summit.” The tweet came on April 20th, shortly after North Korean state media reported that their country would close down the Punggye-ri blast site and stop testing missiles. South Korea also welcomed the move, which comes on the eve of a summit planned for April 27th between Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, with another one scheduled to take place by early June, for Mr Kim and Mr Trump.

Spring is definitely in the air. On April 19th Mr Moon said that the North Korean leader was no longer insisting on the withdrawal of American troops from the Korean peninsula as a precondition for giving up his nuclear weapons. Unlike in previous years, Mr Kim has not issued any condemnations of the military drills that America and South Korea have been performing since the beginning of the month. Nor has he commented on the appointment of John Bolton as Mr Trump’s national security adviser: the North used to denounce him as “human scum” and a “bloodsucker”. By the standards of the North’s vituperative propaganda machine, this is as emollient as it gets.

Nonetheless, there was nothing in Mr Kim’s statement, as reported by the North Korean media, to suggest that the decision was a step towards relinquishing nuclear weapons. On the contrary, Mr Kim said that his country had “verified the completion of nuclear weapons” and that he would halt the tests because they were no longer necessary. Many analysts have been predicting such a moratorium ever since the North announced late last year that it had successfully completed construction of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach America.

Mr Kim’s comments are therefore best read as an attempt to reiterate North Korea’s status as a nuclear state (although analysts are still not quite sure that his scientists have perfected all the components of a long-range nuclear missile). The moratorium might spare Mr Trump and Mr Moon further embarrassment, but it does not necessarily improve the security of America and South Korea. It is telling that Japan, which was already well within range of Mr Kim’s existing weapons stockpile before last year’s round of tests, and has long worried about being left out in the cold during the current round of North Korean diplomacy, reacted more cautiously. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe welcomed the announcement, but said it was important that it lead to “complete, verifiable denuclearisation”—to which there is still no clear commitment.

Mr Trump has said that he might pull out of the summit if he did not feel it were worth America’s time. But his and Mr Moon’s enthusiastic reaction to Mr Kim’s overtures are ramping up expectations for the meetings. South Korea may be happy with relatively modest results, such as regular talks, a resumption of family reunions and cultural exchanges, and perhaps even a revival of humanitarian aid that does not fall foul of the international sanctions regime against the North. But America’s avowed and only aim is to get Mr Kim to give up his nukes. If Mr Trump goes into his pow-wow expecting a quick win, only to find that the North Korean leader’s friendliness does not stretch that far, the mood may sour alarmingly.SINCE the start of the year, the question on the minds of many Turks was not whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured, left) would call early presidential and parliamentary elections, but when. The answer arrived on April 18th, when the Turkish strongman pushed the vote forward by eighteen months, to June 24th 2018, earlier than almost everyone had expected. So what does Mr Erdogan hope to achieve by marching Turks to the polls for the sixth time in four years, and for the second time under emergency law?

Despite posting an impressive 7.4% growth rate last year, thanks largely to a credit boom and a series of stimulus measures, Turkey’s economy has begun to run out of steam. Inflation has been in double digits for over a year. In the space of a month, two of the country’s biggest conglomerates entered talks to restructure as much as $9bn in debt. The Turkish lira, having already lost over half of its value against the dollar since 2013, has been setting record lows almost every day since late March. The currency rebounded on news of the snap election, a sign that investors expect Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development (AK) party to cruise to a win and reduce stimulus spending. Turkey’s leader is clearly aware that a sharp slowdown is imminent. The sooner the vote, the better his chances of sailing home before it hits.

The June elections will mark the first time Turkey votes for president and parliament on the same day. The change was part of a package of constitutional amendments that gave Mr Erdogan sweeping new powers (it passed by a razor-thin margin in a controversial 2017 referendum). He enters the race once again with a giant head start. The rudderless opposition now has barely two months to mount a campaign. The main secular party has yet to come up with a credible candidate for president. The leaders of the main Kurdish party are in prison on trumped-up charges of terrorism. Speculation is mounting that a newly hatched nationalist party will not be allowed to run for parliament. Its leader, a former minister of interior, is the only major politician so far to challenge Mr Erdogan officially for the presidency.

A fair election is not likely. Mr Erdogan has almost complete control over the media, including newspapers that account for roughly 90% of circulation. More than a hundred journalists are in prison. Under a state of emergency in place since July 2016 the president enjoys near-dictatorial powers. Hours after he announced the early elections, his MPs approved the extension of emergency law for another three months.THE Bajau, a people of the Malay Archipelago, spend almost all of their lives at sea. They live either on boats or in huts perched on stilts on shallow reefs, and they migrate from place to place in flotillas that carry entire clans. They survive on a diet composed almost entirely of seafood. And to gather this they spend 60% of their working day underwater.

Unsurprisingly, their diving abilities are prodigious. They sometimes descend more than 70 metres, and can stay submerged for up to five minutes, using nothing more than a set of weights to reduce buoyancy and a pair of wooden goggles fitted with lenses fashioned from scrap glass that are resistant to distortion by the pressure at such depth. Since the Bajau have lived like this for a long time (historical evidence suggests at least 1,000 years), many researchers have speculated that they carry genetic traits which adapt them to their remarkable lifestyle. Now, as they report in Cell, Melissa Ilardo and Rasmus Nielsen of the University of California, Berkeley have shown that this is so.

Immersing someone’s face in cold water and thus requiring him to hold his breath triggers what is known as the diving response. This involves a lowering of the heart rate to conserve oxygen; the redirection of blood from surface tissues to the most oxygen-sensitive organs, such as the brain, the heart and the lungs; and contraction of the spleen, an organ that acts as an emergency reserve of oxygenated red blood cells, so that an increased supply of these cells is released into the bloodstream. Ms Ilardo and Dr Nielsen decided to investigate whether the genetics and anatomy of the Bajau promote these responses.

To do so, Ms Ilardo travelled to Indonesia and recruited 59 Bajau who were willing to give her samples of saliva for DNA analysis and also to have their spleens measured ultrasonically. To act as controls, she also recruited 34 members of the Saluan, a group of landlubbing but closely related neighbours of the Bajau. The spleen scans showed that the Bajau’s are 50% larger than those of the Saluan—a difference unconnected with whether an individual was a prolific diver or one who spent most of his time working above the waves on a boat. This suggests that it is Bajau lineage, rather than the actual activity of diving, which is responsible for a larger spleen.

DNA analysis told a similar story. One intriguing result was a mutation in part of the Bajau genome that regulates the activity of a gene known to be involved in controlling blood flow, such that blood can be sent preferentially to oxygen-hungry vital organs. Another was a mutation in a gene responsible for the production of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that slows the build up of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that is associated with extreme diving. Changes in genes associated with muscle contractions around the spleen and with responses to low oxygen levels also turned up.

Putting these results together, Ms Ilardo and Dr Nielsen argue that the need to collect food by diving has indeed led to the evolution, in the case of the Bajau, of a group who are literally born to dive. Whether that evolution was driven by the failure of those who could not dive well to collect enough food to sustain a large family, or rather, of their dying in the attempt to do so, remains to be determined.TWO years ago, a group of elders in this village in north-western Uganda agreed to lend their land to refugees from South Sudan. About 120,000 are now in the surrounding area. Here they live in tarpaulin shelters and mud-brick huts on a patch of scrub where cows once grazed. Kemis Butele, a gravel-voiced Ugandan elder, explains that hosting refugees is a way for a remote place, long neglected by the central government, to get noticed. He hopes for new schools, clinics and a decent road—and “that our children can get jobs”.

There are more than 20m refugees in the world today, more than at any time since the end of the second world war. Nearly 90% reside in poor countries. In many, to preserve jobs for natives, governments bar refugees from working in the formal economy. Uganda has shown how a different approach can reap dividends. The government gives refugees land plots and lets them work. In some places, the refugees boost local businesses and act as a magnet for foreign aid. Mr Butele and many other Ugandans see their new neighbours as a benefit, not a burden. Sadly, such attitudes are still the exception.

Uganda hosts more than 1m South Sudanese refugees, in unfenced “settlements” across hundreds of square miles in the north. Most came after the collapse of a peace deal in July 2016. Hilda walked for two weeks, carrying her four-year-old son. “If those Dinkas get you on the road, they will kill you,” she says, referring to the president’s ethnic group. This is the third time she has found refuge in Uganda.

Refugees are “brothers and sisters”, say many Ugandans. Mr Butele was once one himself. But the welcome is also a pragmatic one. Northern Uganda is so poor that some locals pose as refugees to receive food aid. Others see refugees as buyers for local goods. Elsewhere in Uganda has indeed seen such positive spillovers. One study from 2016 found that the presence of Congolese refugees in western Uganda had increased consumption per household. Another estimates that each new refugee household boosts total local income, including that of refugees, by $320-430 more than the cost of the aid the household is given. That rises to $560-670 when refugees are given cash instead of rations.

Uganda’s generous refugee policy also opens possibilities for skulduggery. In February the government suspended its senior refugee official and three colleagues, after the UN passed on reports of fraud. Allegations include extortion, the trafficking of women and girls, and the systematic inflation of refugee numbers, to skim off aid money for non-existent beneficiaries.

Such failures hold lessons for other countries, but so do Uganda’s successes, say some economists. Paul Collier and Alexander Betts, of Oxford University, argue that rich countries should pay other “havens” to open their labour markets, as Uganda has. The result, they say, is a triple win: for refugees; for host economies; and for rich countries to which the refugees otherwise might swarm chaotically.

But security and cultural concerns often trump potential economic benefits. In Jordan refugees make up 20% of the population. Only since 2016 has the government allowed them to work, in exchange for help from Britain, the World Bank and the European Union. The “Jordan Compact” has had mixed results. The government handed out work permits, but only for certain sectors. Some refugees found construction work, but many shunned low-paying factory jobs.

They will go far

Sending aid to the countries from which refugees come may actually encourage migration, as potential migrants gain the means to pay smugglers. This suggests that rather than sending aid, rich countries should lead by example and open their own labour markets (see article). In the short term, as Mr Collier and Mr Betts argue, it may be easier for refugees to find employment in nearby countries similar to their own. But in the long term, they will make more money in richer countries, and so send more remittances home.

Refugee influxes produce both winners and losers. In Tanzania, a surge of Burundian and Rwandan refugees from 1993 caused a sharp rise in food prices, helping local farmers but hurting town-dwellers. Even in northern Uganda, protesting locals blocked a road last year, complaining that their hopes for improved living conditions and abundant jobs had not been met.

Many refugees in the latest influx are also struggling. Settlements have restaurants, billiard halls, pharmacies and vegetable stalls, but business is sluggish. In one, Imvepi, Jeff Mambo, a refugee, recently opened the “Exile Salon”, offering “cute styles for mens” at 1,500 shillings ($0.41) per trim. But few refugees come for haircuts; they have little cash to spare. Next door, women sell their bland UN food rations for salt and soap.

One problem is that donors have given only a third of the funding needed in 2017—a shortfall of $443m. Health and education services are expanding too slowly: one school has 4,200 students and just 16 teachers. In the past, refugees in Uganda got one-hectare parcels of land. New arrivals get smaller, stony plots, big enough to grow household greens, but not a surplus. During a food shortage last year, some refugees ventured homeward to recover abandoned crops; a few got killed. The World Food Programme gave others half their rations in cash. But as yet the markets to supply grain quickly and in sufficient quantities did not exist—as hungry refugees were well aware.

Refugees are more likely to thrive and integrate if allowed to move freely and work legally. It helps, too, if they receive aid in cash rather than kind. However, in Uganda, which is also coping with a new influx from Congo, the welcome for refugees is wearing thin. And in South Sudan, the killing continues. Having returned and fled twice before, Hilda is not hopeful. “I will not go back,” she says.

Baez, Journal of Development Economics, 2011, vol. 96, issue 2ON THE streets of west European cities, secular leftists, politically active Muslims and radically minded Christians (a rarefied constituency, but they do exist) have often found themselves marching and chanting together. It happened in the run-up to the Anglo-American attack on Saddam Hussein in 2003, when the core organisers of some of the largest street demonstrations seen in Britain included the Socialist Workers Party and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), both small groups with a gift for mobilising huge crowds. Similar alliances came into play in protests over Israeli military action in Lebanon and Gaza, and over the perceived willingness of Western governments to condone or encourage Israel.

But reactions to the ongoing misery in Syria, and to Western intervention in that country, have been entirely different. Secular leftists in the West, who in general oppose any use of force by their governments, were instinctively horrified by the assault on Syria unleashed on April 14th by America, Britain and France. Many Christian churches in the West opposed the strikes, partly under the influence of co-religionists in Syria who see President Bashar al-Assad as a protector and are in turn protective of him. But the response of politically engaged Muslims in the West ranged from awkward silence to complaints that Mr Assad had not been punished hard enough for his crimes against the Syrian people.

While secular radicals denounced their governments’ militarist and imperialist sins, the MAB, a group said by a government report to have links to the global Muslim Brotherhood but which denies any link, deplored the action against Mr Assad only on grounds that it was too little, too late, and perhaps even so mild as to be counter-productive. In a statement issued shortly after the Western missile strikes, it said:

For seven years, the people of Syria have been subjected to the brutality of the Assad regime and its allies amid international inaction. Nearly 400,000 Syrians have been killed since the start of the conflict, and the latest air strikes merely send a message to the Syrian regime that the murder of civilians with any other weapon besides chemical weapons, will be tolerated. While long overdue, the British government's condemnation is welcomed. However more needs to be done to ensure that the people of Syria will not continue to pay the price for these air strikes.

In France, the website of the country’s most extensively organised Muslim group republished an interview with an Islamic NGO which confirmed the crimes that Western military action was intended to punish. Chemical weapons had been used against besieged enclaves both earlier this month and in February, the NGO spokesman said.

Although not many Muslim voices have been raised in active support of Western policy decisions, the mere absence of any negative reaction across much of European Islam has been striking. Rashad Ali, a fellow of the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said he detected a “tense silence” among British Muslim leaders who were instinctively wary of Western military action anywhere in the Islamic world but did not want to say anything that condoned Mr Assad.

In the words of H.A. Hellyer, a fellow of the Royal United Services Institute, “Muslim Britons and French Muslims are broadly disinclined to condemn their countries’ action against Assad because they, like the rest of us, are conscious of his terrible record and appalling regime—even though many of them remain conflicted about offering full-throated support, when Western policy has hitherto been so muddled with regard to Assad and Syrian civilians.”

The Christian reaction, both locally and further afield, was very different. Within hours of the Western air strikes, three Christian leaders in Syria described them as “brutal aggression” and an “unjustified assault on a sovereign country” and insisted that there was no convincing evidence of the government having used chemical weapons. They urged their counterparts in America, Britain and France to press their government to desist from further action.ON MONDAY Kendrick Lamar, a 30-year-old rapper from Compton, Los Angeles, won the Pulitzer prize for music. It was an extraordinary moment, and not just because it’s the first time the prize has been awarded to somebody who isn’t a classical or jazz musician. The jury awarded the prize to the wrong album.

“DAMN.”, the winning record, is “virtuosic”, just as the jurors say. Over the spare, stuttering beats of trap, a popular sub-genre of hip hop from the Deep South, Mr Lamar invites us to eavesdrop as he confesses to a host of sins—pride, lust, greed, anger, hypocrisy—as well as his fear of being judged, by his fire-and-brimstone God. Hip hop is still a genre that revels in braggadocio and conspicuous consumption, and Mr Lamar is no different from his peers. He understands temptation. But where some rappers look in the mirror and see playboy-gangsters, Lamar sees a sinner, tormented by his success and by his responsibility to those less fortunate than he is. His great talent is how, with his blazing lines, he makes us feel the heat of hellfire.

“DAMN.”, then, is most certainly virtuosic. The jury, however, also praised it for capturing “the complexity of modern African-American life”. Many of the experiences Lamar recounts will be familiar to those for whom racism and violence are daily realities: there’s the constant fear of being killed by a gang member or by the police, “‘cause that’s what you do when you’re 17”, and the desire for retribution that accompanies the news that a loved one has been murdered. Yet “DAMN.” is not an album about the complexity of modern African-American life so much as it is about the complexity of Mr Lamar’s inner life. The album cover is a portrait of a doleful Lamar, his head bent down, seemingly under the weight of his existential burden. On this album he turns inward, to consider the state of his soul.

But on his previous record, “To Pimp a Butterfly” (2015), his focus was wider. On the cover of that album, Lamar can hardly be made out among a crowd of young black men, who pose triumphantly in front of the White House. The record itself is similarly thronged with a varied cast of characters from the drama of African and black American history, from Kunta Kinte, a fictional 18th-century slave from Alex Haley’s novel “Roots”, to Nelson Mandela. As Tupac, a rapper, tells Lamar in an imaginary conversation, “We ain’t even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us.” These stories are about the daily terror of living under racism and the daily fight to counter it, even as veterans of the struggle burn out and give up. Channelling the history of black music with bursts of jazz, funk and soul (George Clinton and Ronald Isley contribute vocals), it helped to reinvigorate a black consciousness that had lain almost dormant in hip hop for years.

Though “DAMN.” was the best-selling album of 2017, none of its tracks has become emblematic of black consciousness, as “Alright”, a single off “Butterfly”, has. An ode to black resilience in the face not just of institutionally racist police forces but also crippling self-doubt, it would become an anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement. That “Butterfly” resounded in such a way is proof of how honestly it captured what it means to be black in America today.

The Pulitzer prize for music rarely makes such a splash. It has already been argued that the medal, which has almost always gone to musicians working outside of the mainstream, needed Lamar’s victory more than he did. It’s just a shame that the board didn’t make their bid for relevance two years earlier, when the more deserving album could have been honoured.IN CASE anyone should think American white evangelicals are actually in favour of extra-marital affairs with porn stars, Robert Jeffress, a well-known pastor from Texas, offered a helpful explainer last month. “Evangelicals still believe in the commandment, Thou shall not have sex with a porn star”, he told Fox News. “However, whether this president violated that commandment or not is totally irrelevant to our support of him.”

It was useful to have this cleared this up. Since Stephanie Clifford, a porn star who is also known as Stormy Daniels, alleged that she had had a sexual tryst with Donald Trump only months after his third wife gave birth, the president appears to have become even more popular among white evangelicals than he was before. A survey by Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), published this week, suggests support among white evangelicals for Mr Trump is, at 75%, at the highest level ever recorded.

That is much higher than the president’s 42% approval rating among the general population. It is also represents a fairly steady recent increase in white evangelicals’ support for Mr Trump. Less than half backed him during the Republican primaries, in 2016. But since Mr Trump became president their support has not dropped below 65%. Robert Jones, chief executive of PRRI, said that fits a familiar established pattern: evangelicals tend to cluster behind whoever emerges as the Republican candidate in a given race—and cluster even more forcefully when that candidate wins office.

But it seems remarkable that white evangelicals could be so unfazed by Mr Trump’s latest scandals. Last month, Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against the president in an effort to be free of a hush agreement she had signed with his attorney. Also last month, a former Playboy model called Karen McDougal gave a television interview in which she described an alleged 10-month-long affair with Mr Trump in 2006 (which was also the year of his alleged tryst with Ms Clifford). Ms McDougal claimed that the president had offered her money after their first sexual encounter and that she ended the affair because she became consumed with guilt about his adultery. The White House has denied that Mr Trump had the alleged affairs.

Perverse though it seems, it is no coincidence that the president’s popularity with white evangelicals has increased amid these scandals. White evangelicals are a fading force in American politics and society and Mr Trump has cast himself as their defender. So when he comes under attack, they consider themselves to be under attack too.

A PRRI survey conducted last year found the proportion of Americans who are white evangelicals had fallen to 17%, from 23% in 2006. The intervening years featured another development, the introduction of gay marriage, which for many conservative Christians is both emblematic of their decline and exceptionally aggravating. Mr Trump has signalled his sympathy for such cultural fears by vowing to exclude transgender people from the armed forces. He has also aligned himself firmly with the pro-life movement, including by addressing an annual anti-abortion march in Washington and appointing conservative judges. The aggressive manner in which he has claimed to be leading a counter-cultural pushback seems to go down with white evangelicals especially well. “Trump is like the boy who punches the bully in the playground”, says Mr Jones. “They like that”.

A longstanding idea that white evangelicals are most concerned about the moral character of their leader has, in the process, gone out the window. In a recent interview with Politico Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, an influential Christian campaign group, said Mr Trump’s relationship with evangelicals was transactional. He suggested evangelicals had got much out of the deal, with Mr Trump delivering more on policy, “than any other president in my lifetime.”

This is a big reason why Mr Trump’s approval ratings have stayed remarkably steady, despite the many scandals buffeting his administration. Evangelicals are one of the biggest segments of his coalition and they are going nowhere. The PRRI survey also found that 69% of white evangelical Protestants who identify with or lean towards the Republican Party would prefer Donald Trump over any other candidate to be the party’s presidential nominee in 2020.AMERICANS, and people who travel to America, have good reason to celebrate this month. By the end of April, the four major credit-card networks in the country will all stop requiring retailers to collect signatures from customers when completing transactions. Visa, the world’s biggest credit-card issuer, announced in January that signatures would no longer be required from this month for retailers in North America with chip-card readers. For Mastercard, the second-largest, the same change became effective on April 13th, covering purchases in the United States and Canada. American Express, in third place, is dropping the signature requirement this month for retailers around the world. Discover, the fourth, is doing so in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

Although retailers will have the option of continuing to make customers sign many have signalled they will not do so. Big retail chains such as Walmart and Target have said they will put an end to signatures. Mark Horwedel, the chief executive of the Merchant Advisory Group, which represents major American retailers, told the New York Times that he expects around 75% to do away with signatures by the end of 2018. Already, the credit-card companies do not require signatures for transactions under a certain amount, but soon at most stores they will be gone altogether.

For travellers to these countries the move is good news. The random scribbles that are applied to receipts and digital screens have long ceased to protect purchasers from fraud. All they really do is slow down the check-out process, causing longer lines and raising costs for retailers.

But to Europeans, the news will surely seem slightly puzzling. All the way back in 1994, Visa, Mastercard and Europay developed a standard for credit cards with a computer chip. Soon chip-and-PIN purchases were common across the continent. Rather than verifying their identities with a signature, customers inserted their chip cards into readers and then entered secret PIN codes.

But as The Verge, a news website, has documented, America resisted the change. Fraud was not terribly common, but magnetic-strip credit cards were everywhere, and it would have been complicated and expensive to replace them with chip cards. (This will sound familiar to anyone who wonders why America has not joined the rest of the world in adopting the metric system.) It was not until 2015 that Visa and Mastercard started penalising issuers who did not put chips in their cards, causing Americans finally to adopt them.

The move this month away from chip-and-signature does not imply a switch to the more secure chip-and-PIN. Instead, America will adopt chip-and-, well, nothing. The announcement by the credit-card issuers to drop the signature requirement is an admission that signatures did not really prevent fraud. But they do not claim that abandoning them makes things safer. Once Americans have grown accustomed to the speed and convenience of making credit-card transactions without any sort of identity verification, it might become a lot harder to persuade them to adopt the more time-consuming—but more secure—chip-and-PIN system.

The answer arrived on April 18th, when the Turkish strongman pushed the vote forward by eighteen months, to June 24th 2018, earlier than almost everyone had expected. So what does Mr Erdogan hope to achieve by marching Turks to the polls for the sixth time in four years, and for the second time under emergency law?

Despite posting an impressive 7.4% growth rate last year, thanks largely to a credit boom and a series of stimulus measures, Turkey’s economy has begun to run out of steam. Inflation has been in double digits for over a year. In the space of a month, two of the country’s biggest conglomerates entered talks to restructure as much as $9bn in debt. The Turkish lira, having already lost over half of its value against the dollar since 2013, has been setting record lows almost every day since late March. The currency rebounded on news of the snap election, a sign that investors expect Mr Erdogan and his Justice and Development (AK) party to cruise to a win and reduce stimulus spending. Turkey’s leader is clearly aware that a sharp slowdown is imminent. The sooner the vote, the better his chances of sailing home before it hits.

The June elections will mark the first time Turkey votes for president and parliament on the same day. The change was part of a package of constitutional amendments that gave Mr Erdogan sweeping new powers (it passed by a razor-thin margin in a controversial 2017 referendum). He enters the race once again with a giant head start. The rudderless opposition now has barely two months to mount a campaign. The main secular party has yet to come up with a credible candidate for president. The leaders of the main Kurdish party are in prison on trumped-up charges of terrorism. Speculation is mounting that a newly hatched nationalist party will not be allowed to run for parliament. Its leader, a former minister of interior, is the only major politician so far to challenge Mr Erdogan officially for the presidency.

A fair election is not likely. Mr Erdogan has almost complete control over the media, including newspapers that account for roughly 90% of circulation. More than a hundred journalists are in prison. Under a state of emergency in place since July 2016 the president enjoys near-dictatorial powers. Hours after he announced the early elections, his MPs approved the extension of emergency law for another three months.ON THE streets of west European cities, secular leftists, politically active Muslims and radically minded Christians (a rarefied constituency, but they do exist) have often found themselves marching and chanting together. It happened in the run-up to the Anglo-American attack on Saddam Hussein in 2003, when the core organisers of some of the largest street demonstrations seen in Britain included the Socialist Workers Party and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), both small groups with a gift for mobilising huge crowds. Similar alliances came into play in protests over Israeli military action in Lebanon and Gaza, and over the perceived willingness of Western governments to condone or encourage Israel.

But reactions to the ongoing misery in Syria, and to Western intervention in that country, have been entirely different. Secular leftists in the West, who in general oppose any use of force by their governments, were instinctively horrified by the assault on Syria unleashed on April 14th by America, Britain and France. Many Christian churches in the West opposed the strikes, partly under the influence of co-religionists in Syria who see President Bashar al-Assad as a protector and are in turn protective of him. But the response of politically engaged Muslims in the West ranged from awkward silence to complaints that Mr Assad had not been punished hard enough for his crimes against the Syrian people.

While secular radicals denounced their governments’ militarist and imperialist sins, the MAB, a group said by a government report to have links to the global Muslim Brotherhood but which denies any link, deplored the action against Mr Assad only on grounds that it was too little, too late, and perhaps even so mild as to be counter-productive. In a statement issued shortly after the Western missile strikes, it said:

For seven years, the people of Syria have been subjected to the brutality of the Assad regime and its allies amid international inaction. Nearly 400,000 Syrians have been killed since the start of the conflict, and the latest air strikes merely send a message to the Syrian regime that the murder of civilians with any other weapon besides chemical weapons, will be tolerated. While long overdue, the British government's condemnation is welcomed. However more needs to be done to ensure that the people of Syria will not continue to pay the price for these air strikes.

In France, the website of the country’s most extensively organised Muslim group republished an interview with an Islamic NGO which confirmed the crimes that Western military action was intended to punish. Chemical weapons had been used against besieged enclaves both earlier this month and in February, the NGO spokesman said.

Although not many Muslim voices have been raised in active support of Western policy decisions, the mere absence of any negative reaction across much of European Islam has been striking. Rashad Ali, a fellow of the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said he detected a “tense silence” among British Muslim leaders who were instinctively wary of Western military action anywhere in the Islamic world but did not want to say anything that condoned Mr Assad.

In the words of H.A. Hellyer, a fellow of the Royal United Services Institute, “Muslim Britons and French Muslims are broadly disinclined to condemn their countries’ action against Assad because they, like the rest of us, are conscious of his terrible record and appalling regime—even though many of them remain conflicted about offering full-throated support, when Western policy has hitherto been so muddled with regard to Assad and Syrian civilians.”

The Christian reaction, both locally and further afield, was very different. Within hours of the Western air strikes, three Christian leaders in Syria described them as “brutal aggression” and an “unjustified assault on a sovereign country” and insisted that there was no convincing evidence of the government having used chemical weapons. They urged their counterparts in America, Britain and France to press their government to desist from further action.ON MONDAY Kendrick Lamar, a 30-year-old rapper from Compton, Los Angeles, won the Pulitzer prize for music. It was an extraordinary moment, and not just because it’s the first time the prize has been awarded to somebody who isn’t a classical or jazz musician. The jury awarded the prize to the wrong album.

“DAMN.”, the winning record, is “virtuosic”, just as the jurors say. Over the spare, stuttering beats of trap, a popular sub-genre of hip hop from the Deep South, Mr Lamar invites us to eavesdrop as he confesses to a host of sins—pride, lust, greed, anger, hypocrisy—as well as his fear of being judged, by his fire-and-brimstone God. Hip hop is still a genre that revels in braggadocio and conspicuous consumption, and Mr Lamar is no different from his peers. He understands temptation. But where some rappers look in the mirror and see playboy-gangsters, Lamar sees a sinner, tormented by his success and by his responsibility to those less fortunate than he is. His great talent is how, with his blazing lines, he makes us feel the heat of hellfire.

“DAMN.”, then, is most certainly virtuosic. The jury, however, also praised it for capturing “the complexity of modern African-American life”. Many of the experiences Lamar recounts will be familiar to those for whom racism and violence are daily realities: there’s the constant fear of being killed by a gang member or by the police, “‘cause that’s what you do when you’re 17”, and the desire for retribution that accompanies the news that a loved one has been murdered. Yet “DAMN.” is not an album about the complexity of modern African-American life so much as it is about the complexity of Mr Lamar’s inner life. The album cover is a portrait of a doleful Lamar, his head bent down, seemingly under the weight of his existential burden. On this album he turns inward, to consider the state of his soul.

But on his previous record, “To Pimp a Butterfly” (2015), his focus was wider. On the cover of that album, Lamar can hardly be made out among a crowd of young black men, who pose triumphantly in front of the White House. The record itself is similarly thronged with a varied cast of characters from the drama of African and black American history, from Kunta Kinte, a fictional 18th-century slave from Alex Haley’s novel “Roots”, to Nelson Mandela. As Tupac, a rapper, tells Lamar in an imaginary conversation, “We ain’t even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us.” These stories are about the daily terror of living under racism and the daily fight to counter it, even as veterans of the struggle burn out and give up. Channelling the history of black music with bursts of jazz, funk and soul (George Clinton and Ronald Isley contribute vocals), it helped to reinvigorate a black consciousness that had lain almost dormant in hip hop for years.

Though “DAMN.” was the best-selling album of 2017, none of its tracks has become emblematic of black consciousness, as “Alright”, a single off “Butterfly”, has. An ode to black resilience in the face not just of institutionally racist police forces but also crippling self-doubt, it would become an anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement. That “Butterfly” resounded in such a way is proof of how honestly it captured what it means to be black in America today.

The Pulitzer prize for music rarely makes such a splash. It has already been argued that the medal, which has almost always gone to musicians working outside of the mainstream, needed Lamar’s victory more than he did. It’s just a shame that the board didn’t make their bid for relevance two years earlier, when the more deserving album could have been honoured.IN CASE anyone should think American white evangelicals are actually in favour of extra-marital affairs with porn stars, Robert Jeffress, a well-known pastor from Texas, offered a helpful explainer last month. “Evangelicals still believe in the commandment, Thou shall not have sex with a porn star”, he told Fox News. “However, whether this president violated that commandment or not is totally irrelevant to our support of him.”

It was useful to have this cleared this up. Since Stephanie Clifford, a porn star who is also known as Stormy Daniels, alleged that she had had a sexual tryst with Donald Trump only months after his third wife gave birth, the president appears to have become even more popular among white evangelicals than he was before. A survey by Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), published this week, suggests support among white evangelicals for Mr Trump is, at 75%, at the highest level ever recorded.

That is much higher than the president’s 42% approval rating among the general population. It is also represents a fairly steady recent increase in white evangelicals’ support for Mr Trump. Less than half backed him during the Republican primaries, in 2016. But since Mr Trump became president their support has not dropped below 65%. Robert Jones, chief executive of PRRI, said that fits a familiar established pattern: evangelicals tend to cluster behind whoever emerges as the Republican candidate in a given race—and cluster even more forcefully when that candidate wins office.

But it seems remarkable that white evangelicals could be so unfazed by Mr Trump’s latest scandals. Last month, Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against the president in an effort to be free of a hush agreement she had signed with his attorney. Also last month, a former Playboy model called Karen McDougal gave a television interview in which she described an alleged 10-month-long affair with Mr Trump in 2006 (which was also the year of his alleged tryst with Ms Clifford). Ms McDougal claimed that the president had offered her money after their first sexual encounter and that she ended the affair because she became consumed with guilt about his adultery. The White House has denied that Mr Trump had the alleged affairs.

Perverse though it seems, it is no coincidence that the president’s popularity with white evangelicals has increased amid these scandals. White evangelicals are a fading force in American politics and society and Mr Trump has cast himself as their defender. So when he comes under attack, they consider themselves to be under attack too.

A PRRI survey conducted last year found the proportion of Americans who are white evangelicals had fallen to 17%, from 23% in 2006. The intervening years featured another development, the introduction of gay marriage, which for many conservative Christians is both emblematic of their decline and exceptionally aggravating. Mr Trump has signalled his sympathy for such cultural fears by vowing to exclude transgender people from the armed forces. He has also aligned himself firmly with the pro-life movement, including by addressing an annual anti-abortion march in Washington and appointing conservative judges. The aggressive manner in which he has claimed to be leading a counter-cultural pushback seems to go down with white evangelicals especially well. “Trump is like the boy who punches the bully in the playground”, says Mr Jones. “They like that”.

A longstanding idea that white evangelicals are most concerned about the moral character of their leader has, in the process, gone out the window. In a recent interview with Politico Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, an influential Christian campaign group, said Mr Trump’s relationship with evangelicals was transactional. He suggested evangelicals had got much out of the deal, with Mr Trump delivering more on policy, “than any other president in my lifetime.”

This is a big reason why Mr Trump’s approval ratings have stayed remarkably steady, despite the many scandals buffeting his administration. Evangelicals are one of the biggest segments of his coalition and they are going nowhere. The PRRI survey also found that 69% of white evangelical Protestants who identify with or lean towards the Republican Party would prefer Donald Trump over any other candidate to be the party’s presidential nominee in 2020.AMERICANS, and people who travel to America, have good reason to celebrate this month. By the end of April, the four major credit-card networks in the country will all stop requiring retailers to collect signatures from customers when completing transactions. Visa, the world’s biggest credit-card issuer, announced in January that signatures would no longer be required from this month for retailers in North America with chip-card readers. For Mastercard, the second-largest, the same change became effective on April 13th, covering purchases in the United States and Canada. American Express, in third place, is dropping the signature requirement this month for retailers around the world. Discover, the fourth, is doing so in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.

Although retailers will have the option of continuing to make customers sign many have signalled they will not do so. Big retail chains such as Walmart and Target have said they will put an end to signatures. Mark Horwedel, the chief executive of the Merchant Advisory Group, which represents major American retailers, told the New York Times that he expects around 75% to do away with signatures by the end of 2018. Already, the credit-card companies do not require signatures for transactions under a certain amount, but soon at most stores they will be gone altogether.

For travellers to these countries the move is good news. The random scribbles that are applied to receipts and digital screens have long ceased to protect purchasers from fraud. All they really do is slow down the check-out process, causing longer lines and raising costs for retailers.

But to Europeans, the news will surely seem slightly puzzling. All the way back in 1994, Visa, Mastercard and Europay developed a standard for credit cards with a computer chip. Soon chip-and-PIN purchases were common across the continent. Rather than verifying their identities with a signature, customers inserted their chip cards into readers and then entered secret PIN codes.

But as The Verge, a news website, has documented, America resisted the change. Fraud was not terribly common, but magnetic-strip credit cards were everywhere, and it would have been complicated and expensive to replace them with chip cards. (This will sound familiar to anyone who wonders why America has not joined the rest of the world in adopting the metric system.) It was not until 2015 that Visa and Mastercard started penalising issuers who did not put chips in their cards, causing Americans finally to adopt them.

The move this month away from chip-and-signature does not imply a switch to the more secure chip-and-PIN. Instead, America will adopt chip-and-, well, nothing. The announcement by the credit-card issuers to drop the signature requirement is an admission that signatures did not really prevent fraud. But they do not claim that abandoning them makes things safer. Once Americans have grown accustomed to the speed and convenience of making credit-card transactions without any sort of identity verification, it might become a lot harder to persuade them to adopt the more time-consuming—but more secure—chip-and-PIN system.

Still, relative to the current system, the change will be a welcome one for anyone doing business in the United States. Just be sure to check your credit-card statements periodically to make sure that no purchases appear on them that are not your own. As with so many things, there’s a price to convenience.“NEVER has a party abandoned, fled its principles and deeply held beliefs so quickly as my party did in the face of the nativist juggernaut,” Jeff Flake, a Republican senator from Arizona, said in a speech in March. “We have become strangers to ourselves.” There is a lot of truth in this. The speed with which the Republican Party’s establishment accommodated itself to a candidate, and then a president, who spurned all manner of norms and broke many bounds of decency, as well as policy commitments, was indeed without any precedent.

Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, went from refusing to campaign with Donald Trump (after a recording of him boasting about sexual assault became public) to failing quickly to condemn him (when, as president, he spoke of “very fine people on both sides” of confrontations between neo-Nazis and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia). It now appears that Mr Ryan cannot stomach his position—or, alternatively, that he thinks the voters will not provide the Republican House majority he would need to continue in it after this November’s mid-term elections. On April 11th he announced that he will not seek re-election. Like Mr Flake himself, and Bob Corker, a senator who memorably compared Mr Trump’s White House to an “adult day-care centre”, not to mention 40 other House Republicans—a record—he is leaving the field of battle.

However, Mr Flake’s analysis is also flawed. Mr Trump did not for the most part infect Republicans with new beliefs from beyond their ken. He connected, and continues to connect, with what a significant part of its base feels and with what it wants. In so doing, he turned the anti-elitism the party has long fostered in its supporters against its own leadership. In breaking taboo after taboo he did what many in the base had long wanted to see done and to hear said. He is like the “psychoplasmic” monsters in David Cronenberg’s horror film “The Brood”: the party’s id made flesh.

It’s good to be the king

This undoubted and persistent connection, coupled with a surprising amount of loyalty from elsewhere in the party, makes the president pretty much unassailable. Mr Trump, polls say, enjoys the support of 85% of Republicans, compared with 65% for Mr Ryan and 40% for Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. That does not mean he can get anything he wants. Congress has been tougher on Russia than he appears to have wished. His promise to repeal Obamacare has not been fulfilled. He has not (yet) pulled out of the Iran deal. His approach to trade goes against a lot of party history, but on gun control, something he has seemed to favour in the past, a tentative sally was nipped in the bud.

But it does mean that criticising him, or acting in a way that helps his critics—for example by seeking to illuminate the nature of his business dealings—is now almost impossible for a Republican who wants to go on functioning as such. As Mr Corker put it, Republican voters “don’t care about issues”. They just “want to know if you’re with Trump.”

Elected officials whose reservations about Mr Trump are not so strong that they want to spend more time with their families keep quiet, content just to vent when in trusted company. Some have rowed back from previous criticism. In 2016 Mitt Romney, a former governor and presidential nominee, denounced Mr Trump as a “fraud”. Earlier this year he called outbursts about African migrants the president was reported to have made “inconsistent with America’s history and antithetical to American values”. Now, seeking a Senate seat in Utah, he has accepted Mr Trump’s endorsement and salutes his “extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs”—while claiming to be “more of a hawk on immigration than even the president.”

The takeover of the party’s institutions is largely complete. As is usual when a party’s candidate wins the presidency, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has become a subsidiary of the White House. In keeping with the tenor of its new ownership, it now has a website, LyinComey.com, dedicated to attacking the former head of the FBI (see Lexington). Ronna McDaniel, who became the RNC’s chair last year, previously chaired Mr Trump’s campaign in Michigan; Michael Cohen, his personal lawyer, who is under criminal investigation, is one of the RNC’s deputy national finance chairs.

Primaries for the November elections will see hundreds of hopefuls competing to look as close to Mr Trump as possible. There will be no easy victories, if any victories at all, for his critics. The ideological campaign groups that Republicans had to please during Barack Obama’s presidency—the Club for Growth, Heritage Action, the Senate Conservatives Fund—might have been able to resist the trend. But they have decided, for the time being, that Mr Trump is the true conservative they wanted all along.

He is not. What he offers politics is not a conservative agenda. It is not an agenda, or an ideology, at all. It is a set of feelings—about patriotism, about who is a proper American and who is not, about foreigners, about elites, about sovereignty and about power. This fits what Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, has found out by trawling through survey data. People who identify as Republican are united by cultural issues rather than narrowly political ones. They tend to share respect for the flag and the English language, and negative feelings towards Muslims, immigrants, atheists, and gays and lesbians.

United in this, they are oddly divided on issues that have often defined the right in America and elsewhere—such as what the role of the state should be. Andrea Volkens of the Berlin Social Science Centre and her co-authors compared the manifestos of the Republican Party with those of parties elsewhere and concluded that Republicans sit closer to France’s National Front than to the Conservatives in Britain or Canada (see chart 1).

This is not Ronald Reagan’s Republican Party. But then, as Reagan knew, parties reinvent themselves. The Republicans have done so more than once since their party was founded in 1854 as an appendage to the anti-slavery movement. After the civil war it was in the ascendancy, providing 11 of the 15 presidents from the death of Lincoln until the Depression. This was the party of the union, northern cities, industrialists and protestants, run by classical liberals who believed in a nightwatchman state, content to pick up a colony or two but leery of foreign wars. It came crashing down along with Wall Street in 1929—at a time when Democrats already had southern whites, northern immigrants and Catholics in their camp. With the Depression and the New Deal scrambling politics, the Democrats came into the ascendant. Republicans lost all but two of the nine presidential elections between Herbert Hoover’s win in 1928 and Richard Nixon’s in 1968; they held the House for just four of the 60 years between 1935 and 1995.

The passage of civil-rights legislation in the 1960s and the nomination of Barry Goldwater for the presidency in 1964 brought about a new transformation. Goldwater promised a return to the party’s small-government roots, railing against the Great Society notion that every problem needed a government programme and thus setting the tone for Reagan. Civil rights—also seen by some as a small-government issue—delivered lots of white southerners. “As much as I hate to admit it, George Wallace can’t be nominated. Ronald Reagan can. He’s right on the issues,” ran an advert for Reagan in 1976, winking at the governor of Alabama’s past offer of “segregation forever”.

The common clay of the New West

When Reagan was elected four years later his party was balanced on three legs. Economic conservatives wanted government to spend less and tax less; social conservatives, including many evangelical Christians, wanted the government to ban more and permit less; and national-security hawks wanted the government to wield enormous power overseas. This coalition ran the gamut from the libertarian to the deeply illiberal, but its factions had enough in common for the top brass to keep things moving along. The economic conservatives and national-security hawks, all well represented among party activists, elected officials and big donors, were allowed to run things, so long as they paid sufficient regard to the social conservatives. Part of the deal was they would not actually carry out their oft-stated aim to reduce government spending radically: more popular in theory than in practice. Tax cuts, on the other hand, were fine with all but the most dour deficit hawks—the more the merrier.

But within this odd, successful alliance there was already a significant constituency that wanted just what Mr Trump would later offer. Pat Buchanan, a speechwriter for Nixon, ran in the 1992 and 1996 primaries on a platform of opposition to immigration, free trade, gay rights and multiculturalism. The second time round he won four states and about a third as many votes as the winner, Bob Dole.

In the early 2000s, with America attacked by terrorists and mounting foreign invasions, many of these people rallied to the president: internal dissent in the party turned to the matter of taxes—the key issue, early on, for the activists known as the Tea Party. The culturally populist position re-emerged in 2008, when the party no longer needed to support a sitting president and some became smitten with the vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, an Alaskan governor who compensated for not knowing things by making Republican voters feel feisty.

This form of Republicanism attracted a number of former Democrats. John Sides of George Washington University says this migration of working-class whites to the Republicans “mainly occurred from 2009 to 2015. It was not a consequence of the 2016 campaign” (see chart 2). Mr Bartels concurs: “I find remarkably little change in partisanship between 2015, when Trump was first emerging as a national political figure, and late 2017,” he wrote recently. Many of Mr Trump’s supporters joined the party before he did so himself.

Mrs Palin was the harbinger in 2008. In 2012 it was Herman Cain, a black fast-food restaurateur, lobbyist and Tea Partier who had never held elected office and wished to cut the income-tax rate to 9%. He was leading the Republican field when he was accused of sexual harassment by several women—something which, in those innocent days, was enough to sink a candidacy.

Mr Cain was not the only recipient of the base’s wayward affections: it was clearly reluctant to settle down with Mr Romney. In the end it did. But his campaign showed that the party was changing. After Mr Ryan, his vice-presidential candidate, talked like a regular fiscal conservative about tackling the deficit with cuts to social security and Medicare, the campaign whisked him into a witness protection programme. Never again was he allowed to trouble elderly Republican voters who wanted to keep the government’s hands off their Medicare. Spending cuts were not for the party faithful: they were for other, less worthy people—a position that helpfully allied prejudice to prudence.

Vice-presidential candidates could then still be controlled by party machinery. Non-candidates could not be. Fox News, which came to dominate cable news in the 2000s, happily provided a platform for populist conservative politicians, including Mr Buchanan, Mrs Palin, Mr Cain and many more, as well as for popular, partisan and peculiar hosts like Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. It both articulated and enforced a new and often increasingly extreme post-Tea Party orthodoxy to which party higher-ups had to pay heed.

Mr Trump’s 2016 campaign might, in other circumstances, have fallen foul of this—not least because he was clear about wanting to keep spending on Medicare and social security. But Fox is an entertainment channel built on righteous indignation as well as a political operation, and in Mr Trump it faced for the first time a politician whose star power outgunned it. The prime-time audience for Fox News is around 2.4m. In its pomp “The Apprentice”, Mr Trump’s reality show, was sometimes watched by ten times that many. The disparity allowed Mr Trump to dictate terms like the star he is. When Megyn Kelly, a Fox News anchor, asked Mr Trump some mildly prosecutorial questions while moderating a primary debate, Mr Trump threatened to boycott the network. Ms Kelly was not removed, but Fox came firmly on to team Trump.

Don’t be stupid, be a smarty

What happened between 2009 and 2015 to bring about the shift in non-college white voters Mr Trump profited from? The great recession which followed the financial crisis of 2008 might suggest an economic cause; the presidency of Barack Obama suggests a racial one. Neither explanation is wholly satisfactory.

The Obama presidency began with credit shrinking, factories closing and homes being repossessed. But these conditions hit Democratic-voting minorities the hardest. Frustration at stagnant incomes could be to blame, but Mr Reagan and both Bushes were elected while median wages were growing only slowly. It is hard to see why a continuation of the same conditions should result in victory for Mr Trump. And data released after the election showed that blue-collar wages had in fact been growing at their strongest pace in years.

Among the Republican Party’s opponents on the left, it is widely held that Mr Obama’s election drew out racial prejudices of the sort Republicans have used since Nixon’s “southern strategy”. There is truth in this, though also some oversimplification. The most comprehensive recent survey of the influence of racial attitudes on voting, “Us Against Them” by Donald Kinder of the University of Michigan and Cindy Kam of Vanderbilt, finds that voters who espouse racial stereotypes (“black people are lazy”) are indeed more likely to be found in the Republican Party. But it finds that to be mainly because more white people vote Republican. White Democrats are pretty much as likely to hold such views as white Republicans are, and most of them voted for Mr Obama. A majority of whites who voted for both parties in 2016 said that it was important for whites to work together to change laws that are unfair to whites.

There was also something broader going on. The rise of social media allowed people to talk about politics in an unmediated way, reading and saying things that would never have been seen on broadcast television or read in newspapers. Fox understood, to some extent, how this new unfettered and often fact-free discourse worked. Mr Trump knew it in his bones. He could, and did, speak the language of vulgar resentment like a pro. For many of his supporters, the more this was disapproved of, the more valid and admirable it seemed.

Party of one

How long can his dominance persist? The American right has an abiding characteristic that elsewhere is mostly found among left-wing revolutionaries: it eats its children. Before Mr Trump came along, the cycle usually played out like this: a challenger would win a Republican primary by accusing his opponent of being a Washington insider who had betrayed the conservative cause. He would then head off to Washington to rail against business as usual for a few election cycles before being attacked in his turn as a representative of the hated establishment.

At the moment this dynamic appears to be working in Mr Trump’s favour, silencing opponents and rewarding loyalists. At some point, though, the cycle will turn. Today’s saviours will be tomorrow’s traitors.

Political parties centred on a single personality fall apart after the leader goes. Silvio Berlusconi founded two parties in Italy, Forza Italia and People of Freedom. Both proved fissiparous in his absence. But this is an unlikely fate for the post-Trump Republicans. It is hard for a party to collapse completely in a two-party system. It is also rare for one to become again what once it was. Because the party was becoming Trumpian long before Mr Trump took over, it will no more go back to the 1980s in his absence than to the 1880s. Mr Trump will not bequeath a set of political ideas as Reagan did those he had inherited from Goldwater and others. But the attitudes he has ridden to office will still outlive him.

If Trumpism is to define the Republican Party for the next decade or more, there are three ways it could develop. The most worrying would see the party choose another leader who, like Mr Trump, does not care for the separation of powers, judicial independence or a free press, but unlike Mr Trump goes about undermining them effectively. A second possibility is that the party loses power and becomes the elected wing of an anti-government movement, its default setting when the Democrats hold power.

There is a third possibility. Trumpian attitudes could lead to matching policies, ones aimed at fashioning a new New Deal, as Geoffrey Kabaservice of the Niskanen Centre, a think-tank, puts it. A national project America’s right could support might ease the rigidity of a movement some of which borders on anarchism in its hostility to government and much of which equates compromise with treachery. But if based on white resentment, and thus intent on excluding some Americans from its promise, it could entrench as many problems as it solved.Communication is essential for the successful functioning of any organisation, but are some companies taking it to the extreme?

A recent survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas reveals that many managers contact employees after hours—and quite a few expect a timely reply. The survey questions and responses were as follows:

Apparently, leaders are contacting workers after hours. But should they?

The legal factor

Before addressing such issues as work/life balance, perhaps the most important question is whether employers have the legal right to contact employees when they’re not at work.

According to Dallas attorney Todd Shadle, chair of the employment law section of Godwin Bowman & Martinez PC, while most companies have policies regarding non-exempt employees and overtime, after-hours and remote access work is not addressed.

In fact, according to the Challenger, Gray & Christmas survey, less than 10% of surveyed companies have a policy that details communicating for work outside of work hours. Another 3% stated they were working on a policy, but the majority (87.5%) have no procedures in place.

“It becomes a problem when the manager is demanding information immediately—which happens in small businesses as well as major corporations,” Shadle says.

He explains that employees don’t have the luxury of ignoring requests and often feel compelled to respond, so companies need to establish policies that address these issues.

However, he admits that currently, it’s not clear if answering a few voicemail or email messages qualifies as compensable work.

“Regarding exempt employees, there are no restrictions on what an employer can expect,” he says.

That’s because exempt employees operate by a totally different set of rules.

Charles Krugel, an employment lawyer and HR counselor in Chicago, explains, “With employees who are properly classified as salaried employees, the off-the-clock question doesn't apply since salaried employees aren't paid by the hour but on a flat rate.”

As a result, he says the question of whether it is legal to contact an employee after hours or not would depend on whether the employee is salaried or paid by the hour.

“In any event, I strongly advise companies that if they require off-the-clock work, then document all of those hours,” Krugel says.

Beyond that, Shadle believes there is no right or wrong answer if the company is prepared to pay its hourly-compensated employees.

“It's not a matter of ‘should,’ but whether it's cost-feasible for a company to require off-the clock contact with hourly employees,” he says.

The work/life balance factor

After clearing the legal hurdle, it has been established that U.S. companies have the right to contact exempt employees, and pay non-exempt workers (or try to claim that the contact doesn’t constitute a significant time requirement).

But should companies contact employees outside of work hours?

Jason Fried, CEO of Basecamp, doesn’t think so.

“No, it's not company time, it's life time,” he says. Fried believes 40 hours a week should be plenty of time to accomplish everything that needs to get done. If companies can contact workers at will, Fried believes employees never really get to “leave” work.

He admits that there may be emergencies and special situations that require contacting employees, but stresses that these incidents should be real emergencies.

“It’s reasonable to have one or two emergencies a year—but, if it's more frequent than that, you've got deeper problems on your hands,” Fried says.

Adam Beeson, director of communications at G2, believes that there are several factors that determine if companies should contact an employee outside of normal work hours.

“Your business, industry and the function an employee serves for the company would be deciding factors,” he says. For example, in the healthcare industry, a specially-skilled employee might have information that could help a patient.

“However,” he stresses, “in an industry where the work is not a matter of life and death, the questions should be approached differently.”

Many employees have an expectation of after-hours contact. A Gallup poll reveals that 60% of U.S. workers check email outside of business hours.

Elizabeth Cogswell Baskin, CEO and executive creative director of Tribe, Inc., says this issue reflects the company’s culture.

“For some cultures, being available 24/7 is almost a point of pride for employees; for others, employees will find such expectations an affront to their rights to a personal life,” she says.

Baskin believes the tone is set at the top. If the CEO works nights and weekends, there may be an expectation that everyone else will follow suit and communicate around the clock.

“In a company where employees expect to leave their work at the office, managers need to respect that—or have frank discussions with their team about why they sometimes will need to be available after hours.”

The distracted driving factor

Findings from a Harris Poll reveal that 27% of employees say their boss has called/texted them while knowing that they were driving.

“People typically want to please their managers and employers, but doing so [while driving] could come at a big price,” says Joan Woodward, president of the Travelers Institute and executive vice president of Public Policy at Travelers.

Woodward warns that when employees take their eyes off the road, even for a few seconds, the results could be catastrophic.

“It’s important for supervisors to lead by example and make it clear they don’t expect an immediate response while an employee may be driving, whether it be a phone call, email, or text.”

Establishing criteria

If employees need to be contacted when they’re not at work, this should entail guidelines—and, perhaps, a reverse pecking order.

For example, Beeson believes that employees in leadership should be contacted before reaching out to a lower level employee.

“In many instances, the more advanced leader is better prepared to handle the question remotely than the less experienced, lower-level employee,” he explains.

And if the issue at hand can’t be handled remotely, he doesn’t see the point in contacting them.

Fried believes the only criterion to consider should be respect.

“Companies don't own people—they pay people for a full day's work, not a whole day's work.”

He says that 8-9 hours is more than enough time for a workday and anything more than that is “an invasion of life.”

Fried says respect must start at the top, with owners and managers treating their workers as human beings and not cogs in a machine.

“People aren't on-demand like a Netflix show, they are at work or they aren't.”

This one-day workshop will focus on the essential elements of a successful approach to diversity and inclusion. Attracting, hiring, and retaining a diverse workforce and, more importantly, reaping the benefits of this diversity in a sustainable manner, require the organization and its leaders to adopt key strategies, practices, and competencies. Beyond diversity, organizations and their members face the challenge of inclusion: how to effectively connect, integrate, and engage with people across all types of differences in mutually beneficial and enhancing ways. Creating and fostering inclusion—the degree to which people of all group identities and across multiple dimensions of diversity feel safe, appreciated, valued, and able to be authentic at work—involves an active practice on the part of leaders and members of groups and organizations, and is a fundamental basis for building, sustaining, and benefitting from diversity.

This highly interactive workshop will focus on best practices in successful diversity and inclusion initiatives and on their specific application in the participants’ organization. Participants will explore, in light of these best practices, the meaning and importance of diversity and inclusion in their organization, the role of inclusion in reaping the benefits of diversity, key strategies for diversity and inclusion, and their own individual and collective leadership in fostering and benefitting from inclusion.Fintech can be defined as the application of digital technologies to create, record, transfer and manage financial value and risk. We will focus on three areas of fintech that are of particular interest to bankers.

The first area of focus is the distributed ledger technology also knows as blockchain. Did you know that blockchain itself combines digital technologies that originated in cryptography and computer science? We will play with these technologies to get a hands-on understanding of how blockchain might be useful for bankers.

The second area of focus is digital identity. Did you ever think that in the future banks may be in the business of guarding the digital identities of their customers? We will delve into the attributes of digital identity and see what the future might hold.

The third area is digital money and digital payments. You probably have read about the central banks and regulators around the world preparing the groundwork for the issuance of digital currencies. You may have also read about bitcoin mining, digital tokens and smart contracts. We will discuss how various technologies are changing what is considered valuable in the digital space and what regulators might support.This program consists of two in-person modules with online sessions in between.

You will learn strategies and tactics to get you out of the bottleneck and into the express lane, with a significant increase in productivity, a renewed sense of engagement and a genuine feeling of accomplishment at the end of each and every day.

Information overload, coupled with ever-increasing demands from your work and personal life, can make you feel like you’re perpetually in “one step ahead, two steps behind” mode. This in turn hinders your ability to think clearly and make good decisions, which can mean an increased risk of failure in achieving your priorities.

In this seminar, you will fine-tune your capacity to zero in on your most important goals by setting targets and ranking your tasks based on level of urgency to separate the “musts” from the “shoulds.” You will also be introduced to a concrete solution for optimizing your energy, engagement and efficiency – and take your productivity to new heights.Emotional intelligence helps leaders become ‘people smart’ and to use practical tools to inspire better results, at all levels.

What drives proactive behaviour, motivates, commitment, inspiration, understanding, decision-making, healthy conflict resolution and overall performance in organisations today?

Leaders who are skilled in using emotional intelligence (EI) as a professional influence tool.

“The most effective leaders are all alike in one crucial way: They all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence,” Daniel Goleman, author of the New York Times bestseller Emotional Intelligence.

Organisations are now beginning to switch on to the advantages of having their leaders trained in EI. Leaders who employ EI skills help themselves and their people to:

Grow stronger relationships at all levels with colleagues, management, clients and stakeholders

Create ‘proactive’ high-performing teams

Think and act adaptively no matter the situation

Communicate with greater openness and purpose

Achieve better results with greater ownership, accountability and responsibility

In this two-day interactive workshop, you will gain practical and effective skills and tools to understand, engage and influence others to achieve even more. The EI model is simplicity itself, and within each stage participants will gain a multitude of tools for everyday leadership:Given name

She also co‐directs the Arsht Initiatives of UM Ethics Programs, which include a speaker series, funding for faculty/student research in Ethics and Community and a student Ethics Debate series on issues in sport and bioethics.

Anita has lectured on law, ethics and business to many audiences including Visa Latin America, Baptist Health Systems, Palm Beach County Principals, and others. In 2006, she taught a module on Corporate Social Responsibility at the American University in Paris.

Professor Cava's research interests are the legal and ethical aspects of health administration as well as corporate/community engagement and business ethics. As part of the Legal, Ethical and Social Implications (ELSI) Workgroup at UM, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Project Health Design, she analyzed conundrums generated by electronic health information and published related articles in the JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS (Supplement 1) (2010) and in the NORTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY(2008). Other recent publications resulting from research with colleagues in the medical school can be found in the CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS (2008), and the JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ETHICS (2008).

Scholarly work examining legal and ethical obligations of corporations includes Are Anti‐Corruption Efforts Paying Off? International and National Measures In the Asia‐Pacific Region and their Impact on India and Multinational Corporations (with B. Earle), UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII LAW REVIEW (2009) and Integrative Social Contract Theory and Urban Prosperity Initiatives (with D. Mayer), JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS (2007). Previous publications appear in the BERKELEY JOURNAL OF EMPLOYMENT LAW, the UNIVERSITYOF MARYLAND LAW REVIEW, the SANTA CLARA LAW REVIEW, the ARKANSAS LAW REVIEW, and the BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY in addition to many other legal and business journals.

In 2009, the University of Miami Faculty Senate gave Anita the Outstanding Teaching Award, established to recognize one UM faculty member’s “distinguished record in teaching” each year. Also in 2009, the UM Alumni Association presented Anita with the “Inside Out” Award, recognizing her efforts to bring alumni back to campus to engage in discussion about ethics. Professor Cava is also the recipient of several School of Business Administration Excellence in Teaching Awards, most recently from the Undergraduate Business Program in May, 2011, and from the 2010 Executive MBA class in Health Administration. She received her B.A. with Distinction from Swarthmore College and her J.D. from New York University, where she was a Hays Fellow. Before joining the faculty, Dr. Cava practiced law in Washington, D.C. and Miami, primarily in the areas of employment, consumer and commercial litigation.IT IS often said that markets hate uncertainty. America’s marijuana industry is no exception. Earlier this year Jeff Sessions, the country’s attorney-general, rescinded a set of federal guidelines for marijuana-related businesses operating in states where the drug is legal. Now lawmakers and businesses in these states are demanding clarity for an industry that could generate as much as $11bn in revenue in 2018. The financial-services industry may be one of the largest beneficiaries of greater certainty.

Providing banking services to pot-sellers is a risky endeavour. Despite being legal in one form or another in 29 states, marijuana is banned under the federal Controlled Substances Act, and classified as a so-called Schedule 1 drug alongside cocaine and heroin. This is why the vast majority of American banks refuse to do business with the industry, lest they run foul of federal statutes on money-laundering, drug-trafficking and racketeering. As of September 2017, just 400 of America’s 5,700 banks catered to the sector (see chart). Without access to financial services, most marijuana-related businesses operate on a cash-only basis, stashing piles of money in duffel bags and hiring armed guards to protect employees from robberies.













The Obama administration tried to address the issue in 2013 when the Department of Justice laid out its priorities for prosecuting marijuana-related crimes, which included preventing marijuana sales to minors and the trafficking of the drug across state lines. The following year, the Treasury hinted to banks serving the cannabis industry that they would not be charged if they closely monitored their clients and filed “suspicious-activity reports” documenting relevant transactions. But in January Mr Sessions rescinded his predecessor’s pot-friendly policies. The move was not a surprise. In a Senate hearing in 2016, Sessions famously said that “good people don’t smoke marijuana”.

States eager to stimulate their marijuana markets–and the tax revenues that they generate–may take matters into their own hands. California and Massachusetts are considering creating public banks for pot-sellers. And on Capitol Hill, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, a Republican, recently announced that the White House has expressed support for legislation allowing states to regulate marijuana. On April 20th Charles Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, is expected to unveil just such a bill.IT HAS been a busy week for anyone with even a passing interest in North-East Asian geopolitics. On April 17th the Washington Post reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, went to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in Pyongyang over the Easter weekend. The apparent intention of the visit was to prepare for a meeting between Mr Kim and Donald Trump in May or early June. A day later South Korean officials confirmed that talks about permanent peace on the Korean peninsula were on the table for a summit between Mr Kim and Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, on April 27th, along with a joint statement on “denuclearisation”. This is all a far cry from the situation only months ago, when Mr Kim’s frequent missile tests had diplomats worried that the world was on the brink of nuclear war. So is the current flurry of activity cause for optimism?

In principle, bringing North Korea back into international society would be a boon. The world at large would no longer have to put up with Mr Kim’s sabre-rattling provocations. South Korea and Japan, North Korea’s neighbours, might benefit from a new market just next door. For ordinary North Koreans an opening of the country would be even better news. Currently they are not just suffering from the oppressive policies of Mr Kim’s regime—which delights in staging public executions and sending citizens to prison camps for such innocuous activities as listening to K-pop—but also from complete isolation from the world. They cannot visit family members in the South, nor receive visitors from there. And the dense thicket of international sanctions against their country prevents them from taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the global economy.

Next week’s summit between Messrs Kim and Moon may go some way towards easing these pains, for example by establishing regular inter-Korean meetings and enabling further cultural exchanges between the two Koreas. But the kind of rapprochement needed to end the pain for good is still a long way off, for all Mr Trump’s insistence that Mr Pompeo formed a “good relationship” with Mr Kim during his recent visit. This is because the parties—America, North Korea and South Korea, and also Japan and China—are hardly on the same page about the conditions required for a sustained thaw. Mr Trump seems to believe that America’s policy of “maximum pressure” (the thorough implementation of sanctions accompanied by the threat of preventive military action) has brought North Korea to the negotiating table and that Mr Kim may be willing to abandon his nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Yet there has been no indication that Mr Kim is prepared to make any meaningful concessions in this regard. Instead he is reaping the benefits of talks with the world’s top diplomats while spouting the same phrases as his father and grandfather before him. Both Kims senior stressed their commitment to “denuclearisation”. But rather than the end of their own nuclear programme, they meant the withdrawal of American troops and the nuclear umbrella over South Korea and Japan, both of which they demanded as conditions for possible concessions by the North.

This means that unless there is a marked change in the North’s attitude, the current round of talks seems unlikely to yield any substantial results. Indeed, Mr Trump has already indicated that he may walk away if Mr Kim does not show himself to be amenable to America’s aims. The bigger danger is that he does not, and instead makes rash concessions that allow North Korea to divide America from its regional allies.
