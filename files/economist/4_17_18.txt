A SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight became the stuff of nightmares on April 17th when a jet engine apparently exploded in mid-air and a passenger was partially sucked out of a window before being rescued by fellow flyers. The flight from New York’s LaGuardia airport was bound for Dallas, but at 11:30 am, when it was near Philadelphia, the left engine blew up, according to multiple reports. Details are still unconfirmed, but according to reports by passengers and media, a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a window in the cabin, and a woman was partially sucked out of the hole. Other passengers scrambled to assist and pulled her back in. Oxygen masks were released in the cabin, and the plane dropped from 32,500 feet at a rate of more than 3,000 feet per minute before levelling out at about 10,000 feet, according to NBC, a broadcaster. The pilots were able to make a safe landing at Philadelphia International Airport.

There were reports that the woman was rushed to hospital after the landing. There were also reports that a passenger suffered a heart attack during the chaos. It is not clear if the reports referred to the same person. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a regulator, says one person from the flight has died. It is the first passenger fatality on an American airline since 2009, says an agency spokesman, and the first ever on a Southwest flight since the pioneering low-cost carrier was founded in 1967. The spokesman said the incident was caused by “apparent in-flight engine failure of the left engine" and that the agency would have the engine inspected to determine why it malfunctioned.

It is not clear whether the woman was in danger of being pulled from the plane completely. Photos taken by passengers suggest that the hole was the size of the window, which would probably be too small for a person to fit through. Nonetheless, it is the type of incident that could prevent people with a fear of flying from buying a plane ticket for some time. There have been other reports of passengers being sucked from planes in recent years, including from a corporate jet flying over California, an airliner over Somalia that disgorged a suicide bomber, and a Russian cargo plane over Congo. But they have not been on scheduled flights in rich countries.

What happens now? Authorities will probably follow the same path as they did in 1989, when a United Airlines flight experienced rapid decompression after a cargo door failed, causing nine passengers to be sucked out to their deaths. The NTSB opened an investigation and concluded that a flawed design in the cargo door was responsible for the incident. It recommended that airlines replace their door-latching mechanisms and that they use inward-opening doors that cannot be blown out. The agency will no doubt investigate the Southwest incident too. If it finds any flaws in the airliner’s engine, it could issue recommendations or directives that may save lives in the future.



To this story must be added the usual point that flying remains extraordinarily safe. Engine-makers test their jets to destruction to ensure that even in the case of a catastrophic explosion the passengers and crew onboard remain unharmed. Few people come to harm these days due to engine problems, unlike in the early days of aviation. The death of the passenger is a tragedy that should be investigated thoroughly. But the fact that only one passenger has ever died on Southwest flights, when the airline carries over 120m passengers a year, shows that it is the exception which proves an old rule. The most dangerous part of flying is driving to the airport in a car.JUST a few years ago Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, exemplified China’s economic woes. Municipal debt had soared. The most senior local official was known as “Mr Dig Up The City”, a reference to his zeal for grandiose construction projects. A movie theme park, intended as a landmark, closed after failing to draw crowds. It would take nearly a decade, it was estimated, to sell all of Wuhan’s vacant homes.

These days, the city of 11m stands as a monument to China’s resilience. Its economy has accelerated even as the government has controlled debt more strictly. Five subway lines were opened or extended in the past two years alone; they are jammed in rush hour. Investment is pouring into semiconductor production, biotech research and internet-security companies. The glut of unsold homes is almost cleared.

China’s economy, like Wuhan’s, is in much better shape than was the case in late 2015. Then, the country was reeling from a stockmarket crash, suffering from capital outflows and accumulating debt at an alarming rate. But figures reported on April 17th showed growth of 6.8% in the first three months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. In nominal terms growth was above 10%. China’s total debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilised, a sign that the risk of financial crisis has receded (see chart).

The improvement in China’s fortunes can be traced to three factors. First, the government has started to tackle several ingrained problems. After a long period of overproduction of steel and coal, a campaign to close unused capacity restrained output and pushed up prices. To reduce the property overhang, local governments bought millions of unsold homes from developers and gave them to poorer citizens.

In the financial sector, regulators have taken aim at banks’ murky off-balance-sheet loans, and at heavily indebted borrowers such as property developers. Wang Tao of UBS, a Swiss bank, notes that these efforts have given investors more confidence. Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong have risen in value by a third over the past two years. The government has also helped arrange behind-the-scenes rescues of troubled firms. Wuhan featured one of these. The big local steel company, bleeding cash, merged with its much stronger counterpart in Shanghai in 2016. The combined entity is profitable.

A second factor is that China’s economy is maturing. Growth is bound to slow over time as China gets richer, but structural changes are also making growth more stable. Thanks in part to a falling working-age population, which peaked in 2011, incomes are growing more quickly than the economy is. This, in turn, is rebalancing the economy. Excessive reliance on investment is giving way to consumption. And heavy industry is giving way to services, which now account for more than half of GDP, up from a third two decades ago.

At the same time, China is reaping returns on some big investments of the past decade, such as high-speed rail in densely populated areas. Qin Zunwen, a government economist in Wuhan, says that although local debt shot up, it was almost all tied to the construction of infrastructure—half a dozen subway lines, bridges spanning the Yangtze River, elevated expressways—that is now being used. “Yes, it’s much more than we had in the past. Has it exceeded our needs? No,” he says.

The final factor has been good luck. Robust growth in America and Europe has given Chinese firms a lift. After falling in 2016, exports have rebounded. The rise in global commodity prices has filtered into stronger industrial revenues in China, boosting miners and metal producers. That has helped them service their debts. And it has made the task of deleveraging for the broader economy less daunting. China has curbed outflows of hot money by tightening capital controls. It has also benefited from a weak dollar since the start of 2017, which has made the yuan more appealing.

China’s coming few quarters are likely to be bumpier, however. The biggest immediate worry is President Donald Trump. The American administration has announced tariffs on about $50bn of Chinese exports and may soon triple that. Exports to America are only a fraction of Chinese GDP, but a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could wreak havoc on sentiment and supply chains.

The downsides of the campaign to control debt might also become more apparent. Last year regulators focused on the financial system, clamping down, for instance, on borrowing to buy bonds. This year their focus has shifted to government funding. That will have a more direct impact on the economy. China has tried before to rein in profligate local officials, but they have found ways around the rules. A popular recent trick has been to disguise debt in public-private partnerships. Policy this time seems stricter. Subway construction has been halted in cities whose finances were too weak. Tighter liquidity could also weigh on investment. Credit growth is the weakest since 2015.

Over the past decade China’s leaders have revved up investment whenever the economy has slowed beyond their comfort zone. But Xi Jinping, the powerful president, has often said that the quality of growth matters more than the quantity. Officials in Wuhan seem to be getting the message. At recent meetings they have stressed the importance of fostering innovation, cleaning up the environment and keeping a lid on debt. The test is whether they will still be singing that same tune as growth turns down.GERMANY is changing. A country that long equated belonging with having four grandparents with German names, and treated many immigrants as temporary visitors, has seen a massive influx of foreigners following chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to keep borders open to refugees and asylum-seekers. Uncertainty about the country’s ability to cope with this massive influx, and about its economic future in general, has had a political cost.

In last September’s election, Mrs Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Party and its Bavarian partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), suffered a drop in their share of the vote to a post-war low of 33%. Her partners in the grand coalition that has run the country for eight of her 12 years in power, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), also saw their support fall, from 26% to 21%. The anti-immigration AfD, formed only in 2013, took third place with 13%. An unprecedented five months of coalition wrangling to form a government ended only on March 4th when SPD members voted to support a new grand coalition with the CDU/CSU.













Economically though, Germany would seem to be sitting comfortably. The country has a record trade surplus and record low unemployment and enjoyed a budget surplus of €37bn ($47bn), or 1.1% of GDP, last year. Yet even here some uncertainty is creeping in. Globalisation and technology are hollowing out the German labour market and creating new divides between haves and have-nots. And Germany’s mighty engineering industry, the very driver of its prosperity, is being disrupted by new technologies and competitors that upend old business models. The old vision of what it means to be German is being challenged by changes at home and abroad.

The season averaged 7.8m viewers, a long way down from the peak of 14.4m in Season 5 and over 17m for a couple of season premieres.

The episode demonstrated the show's recent weaknesses (spoiler alert: do not read on if you have not watched the finale). More than two series had been devoted to the battle between the group of survivors led by Rick Grimes (pictured, right) and a rival band led by the baseball bat-wielding Negan (centre). Patient viewers were entitled to a climactic send-off. They saw one satisfying twist; Eugene, the eccentric mullet-haired boffin, turned out to be on the side of the angels after all, having sabotaged Negan's ammunition. But the final battle saw Rick slash Negan's throat, only to spare him in the memory of his dead son, Carl (pictured left). This left many viewers unsatisfied.

This behaviour reflected the see-saw mentality of Rick, who has switched from well-meaning statesman to bloodsoaked avenger, many times over the show's long run. The same erratic philosophy has been true of Carol and Morgan, two of the show's other original characters, who have alternated between the strategic approaches of Mahatma Gandhi and Genghis Khan.

Such problems bedevil extended series. Each episode must have something dramatic happen; there are only so many characters for whom the audience can feel sympathy. The result is that so much happens to each individual that narrative coherence and psychological plausibility fly out of the window (remember “Lost”?).

A fundamental problem for “The Walking Dead” is that the actions of zombies are limited to staggering about and biting. The dramatic focus has to be on the human survivors. But it is easy for the show to repeat itself. Rick and his band have wandered from place to place in search of safety—a farm, a prison, a small town—only for each to succumb to rival groups, zombie hordes or both.

With each series 16 episodes long, it is easy for some of the middle shows to seem like filler as the writers build to the final battle. The lead characters are clad in “plot armour”; bullets always miss them, villains opt for mercy rather than execution and so on. The show has attempted to maintain tension by periodically killing off key characters. Even here, viewers have felt cheated; in series 6, Glenn (played by Steven Yeun) appeared to be disembowelled by zombies. For a few episodes, his fate was unsure, leading the character to be dubbed “Schrödinger's Glenn”. He was reprieved, only to be a victim shortly afterwards of Negan's bat at the start of series 7. The show has never recovered.

The writers had the chance to revisit the concept in their spin-off series “Fear the Walking Dead” which has just started its fourth series. This began in Los Angeles before the apocalypse. Had the writers slowed the timeline, this could have been an intriguing portrait of societal breakdown. But instead the show took the Zombie Express to dystopia, creating another series with wandering characters behaving inexplicably.

To survive, both shows need to move in a new direction. Perhaps there could be sign of a cure, with the survivors setting off in search of some crucial ingredient, and persuading others to be vaccinated? Or perhaps a government (even a foreign power) could attempt to reimpose order, dividing the survivors between acceptance and resistance? Dead men need to tell more interesting tales.ON APRIL 13th, delegates of the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency responsible for shipping safety and pollution, announced that 170 of its members had agreed to reduce carbon emissions from shipping to no more than half of 2008 levels by 2050. Shipping in Changing Climates, a research consortium, called the deal “major progress” towards bringing shipping in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But why has it taken two years after Paris to reach such a deal ?

Shipping and airlines were the only greenhouse-gas-emitting industries not mentioned in the Paris agreement. This was, in part, because assigning emissions is hard. To whom should you designate emissions for shipping Chinese goods, made with South Korean components, across the Pacific to American consumers? But similar problems did not stop airlines agreeing on an industry-wide limit within a year. Diplomats argue the slow progress is because any caps would affect exporters, too. If regulators move too aggressively they may reduce the competitiveness of seaborne trade. For instance, Brazil, a big exporter of iron ore to China, fears overzealous caps will drive shipping costs higher, helping its competitor, Australia, whose ores travel a quarter as far as Brazil’s. The idea of slowing vessels down draws ire from countries that export perishable goods, like cherries and grapes, as Chile does.

Others fear that powerful lobbyists have hijacked the process. Transparency International, an NGO, has raised “serious concerns” about the IMO being unusually influenced, for a UN body, by corporate interests. A report by InfluenceMap, a research firm, found that at a recent meeting of the agency 31% of nations were represented, in part, by direct business interests. The way the IMO is structured exacerbates these problems. The IMO is funded proportionately according to the tonnage shipped under a nation’s flag, so countries running “open registries”, which allow any shipowners to register under their flag (sometimes known as “flags of convenience”), have disproportionate influence. Sometimes this helps those keen to limit emissions, such as the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation, where 11% of all ships are registered and which is vociferous in its support of emissions cuts. But for the most part it works against them. Countries are beholden to ship owners, so those nations that are not about to disappear under the water themselves are often averse to any emissions cuts. Panama, where 18% of global ships are registered, supported a much less ambitious deal.

The IMO announcement also faced opposition from countries such as Saudi Arabia and America, who consistently oppose efforts to combat climate change (both refused to sign up to this deal). Even including the agreed cuts, shipping, which currently accounts for almost 3% of total global carbon emissions, will probably see its share of emissions rise in coming years. Technology could help. New design standards are already lowering harmful emissions. Zero-carbon fuels are becoming available. Reducing the speed at which ships travel by 10% could reduce fuel usage by almost a third. Last week’s agreement was a good start to encourage adoption of such changes. As with many such agreements, the implementation is all.A MILLION plastic bottles are sold every minute. Many are not recycled and of those that are, only a small fraction become bottles again. That is, in part, because recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the polymer used to make such bottles, back into material robust enough to hold, say, a fizzy drink, is hard. What would be helpful is a way to break down PET into the chemicals that made it in the first place. These could then be used to make new high-grade PET.

This week John McGeehan of the University of Portsmouth, in Britain, and his colleagues report details of a bacterial enzyme called “PETase” that can do just that. Furthermore, they have engineered a version of this enzyme that can digest plastic faster than the natural variety. Their work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

PETase is secreted by a plastic-munching bacterium called Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bug was discovered in 2016 at a PET-bottle recycling plant in Sakai, Japan. The researchers behind its discovery showed that the enzyme degrades PET into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). A second enzyme then breaks MHET down further, into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The bacterium then uses these chemicals as food sources. The discoverers of PETase also suggested that it may have evolved from bacterial enzymes used to break down cutin, a waxy polymer that coats leaves. That is, in itself, remarkable—for PET has been used widely only since the 1970s, meaning that the enzyme must have evolved to do its job within the past 50 years.

I. sakaiensis digests PET far too slowly, however, to be of much use for industrial recycling of the plastic. To make it so requires understanding how the enzymes do their work. This is what Dr McGeehan and his colleagues set out to do. As MHET is far easier to break down by standard chemical means than PET, they focused on PETase.

They compared the DNA sequence of the PETase gene to that of cutinases from thousands of species of bacteria, looking for systematic differences. They then created new versions of PETase, each with one or more of its amino-acid building blocks changed to resemble those of ancestral cutinases.

As many of the differences between PETase and cutinases were, presumably, what allowed the PETase to do its job, they expected these new enzymes to digest the plastic less efficiently. To their surprise, however, one of the engineered enzymes (with two amino acids mutated to be more cutinase-like) was able to digest PET about 20% faster than the natural one. That is a modest increase, but one that came about by accident rather than design. This, Dr McGeehan argues, shows there is plenty of scope for further improvement.

The team determined the structures of their enzymes by protein crystallography, a technique that takes detailed pictures of a molecule by bombarding crystals of it with X-rays (in this case, at the Diamond Light Source, a machine in Oxfordshire that produces particularly strong X-rays for such purposes). They then used computer modelling to look at how a molecule of PET might dock with the enzyme’s active site—the region where the chemical reaction that breaks down the plastic actually occurs. The more-efficient enzyme they engineered appears to hold the plastic molecule more snugly in the active site than the naturally occurring version.

Interesting though all this is, there is still much to do before PETase can become a useful enzyme. At the moment, a litre of a solution of even the improved enzyme would break down just a few milligrams of plastic per day. Its plastic-digesting ability must therefore be improved by a hundredfold or more to be commercially useful.

This the team hopes to do, in part, by using clues from the enzyme’s structure. Further improvements could come by designing the enzyme to work at temperatures above 70ºC, when PET becomes rubbery, and thus more easily digestible. Bacteria that live in hot springs, and that have cutinases that function at such temperatures, might be pressed into service here. The gene for the enzyme would also have to be transplanted into bacteria that can be grown easily at industrial scales. If these hurdles can be surmounted, though, PETase might make a dent in the scourge of plastic waste.IN A televised interview on April 15th, James Comey tore into the president who sacked him as FBI director last year. Donald Trump, he said, in an appearance intended to publicise his forthcoming book, “lies constantly”, runs his administration like a mob boss, treats and speaks of women like they are “pieces of meat” and is, for these and other reasons, “morally unfit” to be president.

Mr Trump also has “average size” hands, “orange” skin, hair that appears on close inspection to be real, but which must “take a heck of a lot of time in the morning” to arrange, and always wears his ties too long, said Mr Comey, whose projected self-image as a dispassionate and dutiful public servant has always been undermined by a relish for political drama.

The president, characteristically, had got his defence in early. Hours before the interview was broadcast on ABC, he referred to Mr Comey on Twitter as a “slimeball” for the second time in three days. He also said Mr Comey, a former Republican, though he was appointed to run the FBI by Barack Obama, should be jailed for leaking classified information and lying to Congress about the circumstances that led to his sacking. Mr Comey, wrote the president, was “the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!”

Partisans of both stripes will find vindication in this. Mr Trump’s followers, conditioned to see Mr Comey as representative of a “deep state” plot against their insurgent leader, will hear his personal contempt for the president as establishment hauteur. They will also make much of Mr Comey’s acknowledgement that he knew of no solid evidence that the Trump team colluded with Russia, despite having presided over an FBI investigation into the question. Everyone else will sympathise with Mr Comey’s view of the president’s character; even if some may question his priorities in ramping up a personal feud that will guarantee him record-breaking book sales but further weaken what remains of his reputation for impartiality. As Mr Comey is a potential witness in a possible obstruction of justice charge against Mr Trump, arising from Robert Mueller’s enquiries into the president’s decision to sack Mr Comey for refusing to quash the Russia investigation, that is a potential setback for justice.

In a searching five-hour interview, for which ABC published the transcript in full, Mr Comey provided no important revelations. His comment on possible collusion aside, he said little about Russia or Mr Mueller’s investigation. He said his sacking could amount to evidence of obstruction but not whether he thought it had. He did, however, provide some compelling new details of an earlier political controversy—his role in managing the investigation into Hillary Clinton which helped to undermine her candidacy.

Three months before the 2016 election, the FBI’s investigation into Mrs Clinton’s unusual email arrangement as secretary of state had run into the sand. Yet instead of merely announcing that the then Democratic presidential candidate would face no charge, Mr Comey held a press conference in which he accused Mrs Clinton of “extreme carelessness”. A couple of weeks before the election, he further announced that the FBI was, in effect, reopening its investigation into her. The calamitous effect these interventions appear to have had on Mrs Clinton’s standing in the polls suggest they may have cost her the election. The fact that Mr Comey meanwhile kept quiet about a coterminous counter-espionage investigation into the Trump campaign appears to be a clear double standard. Yet in his interview, Mr Comey persisted in justifying his behaviour, more painstakingly than he had previously, by presenting himself as a sacrificial lamb for his agency’s reputation.

The fact that President Barack Obama had suggested the case against Mrs Clinton was overblown, and indications of bias in favour of Mrs Clinton from Loretta Lynch, the then attorney-general, had compelled him, he suggested, in effect to over-compensate. “My view was…that in rare cases, you should offer transparency so the American people can take a look at what you did and know that it was done in an honest, competent, independent way.” Yet if this was intended to insulate the FBI against charges of political interference, it had the opposite effect. Democrats accused Mr Comey of bias; so did Mr Trump, on the basis that his harsh words against Mrs Clinton indicated that there was more to the allegations against her than the FBI director was otherwise letting on.

In an environment of hyper-partisanship, the more conspicuous any government agency makes itself, the more politicised it will almost inevitably seem. Mr Comey made the FBI far more prominent in the 2016 election than it needed to be, and the agency has paid a price for that in the cynical assault Mr Trump has launched on it ever since. Mr Mueller, who has neither spoken publicly nor permitted any leaked information, since his appointment as special council, offers a more compelling example of how to practice law enforcement in a partisan cauldron.

Mr Comey, for all his apparent faults, including an over-sized ego, a dogged refusal to admit fault and rotten political judgement, is an impressive, upright public servant. There is no equivalence between his lapses and the moral affronts of the president he correctly diagnoses. But if only Mr Comey had behaved more as Mr Mueller does. He could have spared the world a lot of trouble.Dear Reader,

This year The Economist celebrates its 175th anniversary. James Wilson, a hatmaker from Scotland, founded this newspaper in September 1843 to argue against Britain’s Corn Laws, which imposed punitive tariffs on grain. We have advocated free trade, free markets and open societies ever since.

Over the years we have also championed many controversial causes, from privatisation to drug legalisation and same-sex marriage. In doing so, we have always been guided by classical liberal values: a belief in human progress, distrust of powerful interests and respect for individual freedom. This is the liberalism of great 19th-century thinkers such as John Stuart Mill. (Confusingly, in America the term “liberal” has become synonymous with big-state leftism. That is not what we stand for.)

Although the world has changed dramatically since 1843, we believe that the values that guide The Economist are as relevant as ever. Yet, in a period of rising populism and, in many parts of the world, of growing authoritarianism, they face greater resistance today than they have for many years. Amid anger over inequality, immigration and cultural change, basic elements of the liberal credo, from globalisation to free speech, are assailed from right and left.

So we have launched Open Future, an initiative to remake the case for liberal values and policies in the 21st century. We want this exploration of ideas to involve our critics as well as our supporters, and to engage a young audience in particular. We are conducting the conversation across all The Economist’s platforms: in the newspaper, on this site, through podcasts, films and on social media. The initiative will culminate in a global event, the Open Future Festival, held simultaneously in Hong Kong, London and New York on Saturday September 15th.

This site is the hub for the Open Future discussions. Here you will find regular online debates, in which prominent outside contributors take sides on a controversial subject and you, our readers, can vote and comment. (Our first debate this week is on whether universities should ban offensive speakers.) You will find details of an essay contest for young people, with entries due by July 15th. And you will find a rich array of articles on free markets and open societies. Over the coming months we will publish guest contributions as well as new articles from Economist staff. We will celebrate liberalism’s history with a series of briefings on great liberal thinkers. And we will look ahead with a special report on the future of liberalism.

We have organised the conversation around five themes. Open Markets will examine the future of capitalism; Open Ideas will look at free speech; Open Society will discuss the balance between diversity, identity politics and political correctness; Open Borders will focus on immigration and Open Progress will consider whether technology is still a route to human progress.

When James Wilson launched this newspaper in 1843, he said its mission was to “take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” Open Future is the latest iteration of that mission. I encourage you to join the conversation. Please take part in our debates, vote in the polls, enter the essay contest and send us your comments at openfuture@economist.com.

Business activities are increasingly global, multifaceted and interdependent. Business leaders need to have the right skills and tools to identify and address a broad range of risks through an integrated approach and an enterprise-wide perspective. The unique Risk Management Association and Cass Business School partnership ensures unparalleled access to risk management experts from global institutions in the City of London as well as to subject matter experts, senior-level business practitioners, guest faculty, world-class research and thought leaders.

Delivered over four days, the programme exposes business leaders and risk managers to a rigorous, yet practical blend of theory, practice and cuttingedge research, designed to build your global risk management knowledge and skills. In addition to its focus on known and quantifiable risks, the programme also concentrates on those risks which are unknowable and difficult to measure. Key areas of focus in the programme include: risk management as a strategic competitive strength; an integrated approach to risk management; fostering a culture and climate that openly communicates risk; a framework for rapidly responding to known risks and unravelling the complexities of the unknown; a focus on risk informed by global perspectives; and gaining a perspective on risk management and its implications for corporate governance.Differentiating your organization’s strategic position relies on one imperative mission: searching for the right plan of action. The right plan of action will not only help you develop your competitive advantage, but enhance it.

This is the heart of strategic business planning.

For any company, the search for an effective strategic plan is an iterative process that should start with recognizing the position you already own, and how you got there. Intuitively, this approach makes sense: reaching new heights demands that we understand our current station.

For business leaders, it’s an approach that requires the steadfast ability to do two things: objectively analyze your internal and external environments to find new insights, and then translate those insights into actionable strategy.

In this two-day course you’ll take a deep dive into the various models, tools, and frameworks that lead to effective strategic business planning.

In an engaging and dynamic learning environment, you will study how companies across various industries implement strategic best practices to out-pace the competition. Every lesson and conversation will be structured around how to apply the same best practices to your own organizational situation.

You’ll also learn how to perform a situational assessment of your competitive landscape to develop new insights, and how to funnel those insights through time-tested methodologies to solve complex business problems and gain a sustainable competitive foothold in your market.In the unfolding competitive global economy, companies face the challenge of evolving strategies and practices to compete effectively. With the increasing trend of economic globalization with the attendant high level of business uncertainties, organizations are now faced with the challenge of coming up with high quality decision making systems. A generally acknowledged challenge in Nigeria is the lack of reliable sources of information for decision makers. This inadequacy provides a compelling reason for organizations to evolve efficient and effective strategies to source and use data to generate information for high quality decision making.

This seminar provides participants with an opportunity to acquire the necessary skills to enable the serve as catalysts for high quality fact-driven decision making. A good understanding of the business environment under which a firm operates is a necessary condition for evolving and implementing effective strategic initiatives in any enterprise. As a general management seminar, Smart Business Decisions: the Power of Data Analysis seminar will enhance managers' ability to make intelligent decisions in the presence of uncertainty. It introduces decision-making best practices to managers ranging from simple descriptive analysis, associative analysis, to business intelligence.

Municipal debt had soared. The most senior local official was known as “Mr Dig Up The City”, a reference to his zeal for grandiose construction projects. A movie theme park, intended as a landmark, closed after failing to draw crowds. It would take nearly a decade, it was estimated, to sell all of Wuhan’s vacant homes.

These days, the city of 11m stands as a monument to China’s resilience. Its economy has accelerated even as the government has controlled debt more strictly. Five subway lines were opened or extended in the past two years alone; they are jammed in rush hour. Investment is pouring into semiconductor production, biotech research and internet-security companies. The glut of unsold homes is almost cleared.

China’s economy, like Wuhan’s, is in much better shape than was the case in late 2015. Then, the country was reeling from a stockmarket crash, suffering from capital outflows and accumulating debt at an alarming rate. But figures reported on April 17th showed growth of 6.8% in the first three months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. In nominal terms growth was above 10%. China’s total debt-to-GDP ratio has stabilised, a sign that the risk of financial crisis has receded (see chart).

The improvement in China’s fortunes can be traced to three factors. First, the government has started to tackle several ingrained problems. After a long period of overproduction of steel and coal, a campaign to close unused capacity restrained output and pushed up prices. To reduce the property overhang, local governments bought millions of unsold homes from developers and gave them to poorer citizens.

In the financial sector, regulators have taken aim at banks’ murky off-balance-sheet loans, and at heavily indebted borrowers such as property developers. Wang Tao of UBS, a Swiss bank, notes that these efforts have given investors more confidence. Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong have risen in value by a third over the past two years. The government has also helped arrange behind-the-scenes rescues of troubled firms. Wuhan featured one of these. The big local steel company, bleeding cash, merged with its much stronger counterpart in Shanghai in 2016. The combined entity is profitable.

A second factor is that China’s economy is maturing. Growth is bound to slow over time as China gets richer, but structural changes are also making growth more stable. Thanks in part to a falling working-age population, which peaked in 2011, incomes are growing more quickly than the economy is. This, in turn, is rebalancing the economy. Excessive reliance on investment is giving way to consumption. And heavy industry is giving way to services, which now account for more than half of GDP, up from a third two decades ago.

At the same time, China is reaping returns on some big investments of the past decade, such as high-speed rail in densely populated areas. Qin Zunwen, a government economist in Wuhan, says that although local debt shot up, it was almost all tied to the construction of infrastructure—half a dozen subway lines, bridges spanning the Yangtze River, elevated expressways—that is now being used. “Yes, it’s much more than we had in the past. Has it exceeded our needs? No,” he says.

The final factor has been good luck. Robust growth in America and Europe has given Chinese firms a lift. After falling in 2016, exports have rebounded. The rise in global commodity prices has filtered into stronger industrial revenues in China, boosting miners and metal producers. That has helped them service their debts. And it has made the task of deleveraging for the broader economy less daunting. China has curbed outflows of hot money by tightening capital controls. It has also benefited from a weak dollar since the start of 2017, which has made the yuan more appealing.

China’s coming few quarters are likely to be bumpier, however. The biggest immediate worry is President Donald Trump. The American administration has announced tariffs on about $50bn of Chinese exports and may soon triple that. Exports to America are only a fraction of Chinese GDP, but a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could wreak havoc on sentiment and supply chains.

The downsides of the campaign to control debt might also become more apparent. Last year regulators focused on the financial system, clamping down, for instance, on borrowing to buy bonds. This year their focus has shifted to government funding. That will have a more direct impact on the economy. China has tried before to rein in profligate local officials, but they have found ways around the rules. A popular recent trick has been to disguise debt in public-private partnerships. Policy this time seems stricter. Subway construction has been halted in cities whose finances were too weak. Tighter liquidity could also weigh on investment. Credit growth is the weakest since 2015.

Over the past decade China’s leaders have revved up investment whenever the economy has slowed beyond their comfort zone. But Xi Jinping, the powerful president, has often said that the quality of growth matters more than the quantity. Officials in Wuhan seem to be getting the message. At recent meetings they have stressed the importance of fostering innovation, cleaning up the environment and keeping a lid on debt. The test is whether they will still be singing that same tune as growth turns down.A SOUTHWEST AIRLINES flight became the stuff of nightmares on April 17th when a jet engine apparently exploded in mid-air and a passenger was partially sucked out of a window before being rescued by fellow flyers. The flight from New York’s LaGuardia airport was bound for Dallas, but at 11:30 am, when it was near Philadelphia, the left engine blew up, according to multiple reports. Details are still unconfirmed, but according to reports by passengers and media, a piece of shrapnel from the engine shattered a window in the cabin, and a woman was partially sucked out of the hole. Other passengers scrambled to assist and pulled her back in. Oxygen masks were released in the cabin, and the plane dropped from 32,500 feet at a rate of more than 3,000 feet per minute before levelling out at about 10,000 feet, according to NBC, a broadcaster. The pilots were able to make a safe landing at Philadelphia International Airport.

There were reports that the woman was rushed to hospital after the landing. There were also reports that a passenger suffered a heart attack during the chaos. It is not clear if the reports referred to the same person. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a regulator, says one person from the flight has died. It is the first passenger fatality on an American airline since 2009, says an agency spokesman, and the first ever on a Southwest flight since the pioneering low-cost carrier was founded in 1967. The spokesman said the incident was caused by “apparent in-flight engine failure of the left engine" and that the agency would have the engine inspected to determine why it malfunctioned.

It is not clear whether the woman was in danger of being pulled from the plane completely. Photos taken by passengers suggest that the hole was the size of the window, which would probably be too small for a person to fit through. Nonetheless, it is the type of incident that could prevent people with a fear of flying from buying a plane ticket for some time. There have been other reports of passengers being sucked from planes in recent years, including from a corporate jet flying over California, an airliner over Somalia that disgorged a suicide bomber, and a Russian cargo plane over Congo. But they have not been on scheduled flights in rich countries.

What happens now? Authorities will probably follow the same path as they did in 1989, when a United Airlines flight experienced rapid decompression after a cargo door failed, causing nine passengers to be sucked out to their deaths. The NTSB opened an investigation and concluded that a flawed design in the cargo door was responsible for the incident. It recommended that airlines replace their door-latching mechanisms and that they use inward-opening doors that cannot be blown out. The agency will no doubt investigate the Southwest incident too. If it finds any flaws in the airliner’s engine, it could issue recommendations or directives that may save lives in the future.



To this story must be added the usual point that flying remains extraordinarily safe. Engine-makers test their jets to destruction to ensure that even in the case of a catastrophic explosion the passengers and crew onboard remain unharmed. Few people come to harm these days due to engine problems, unlike in the early days of aviation. The death of the passenger is a tragedy that should be investigated thoroughly. But the fact that only one passenger has ever died on Southwest flights, when the airline carries over 120m passengers a year, shows that it is the exception which proves an old rule. The most dangerous part of flying is driving to the airport in a car.GERMANY is changing. A country that long equated belonging with having four grandparents with German names, and treated many immigrants as temporary visitors, has seen a massive influx of foreigners following chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision in 2015 to keep borders open to refugees and asylum-seekers. Uncertainty about the country’s ability to cope with this massive influx, and about its economic future in general, has had a political cost.

In last September’s election, Mrs Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Party and its Bavarian partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), suffered a drop in their share of the vote to a post-war low of 33%. Her partners in the grand coalition that has run the country for eight of her 12 years in power, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), also saw their support fall, from 26% to 21%. The anti-immigration AfD, formed only in 2013, took third place with 13%. An unprecedented five months of coalition wrangling to form a government ended only on March 4th when SPD members voted to support a new grand coalition with the CDU/CSU.













Economically though, Germany would seem to be sitting comfortably. The country has a record trade surplus and record low unemployment and enjoyed a budget surplus of €37bn ($47bn), or 1.1% of GDP, last year. Yet even here some uncertainty is creeping in. Globalisation and technology are hollowing out the German labour market and creating new divides between haves and have-nots. And Germany’s mighty engineering industry, the very driver of its prosperity, is being disrupted by new technologies and competitors that upend old business models. The old vision of what it means to be German is being challenged by changes at home and abroad.

The season averaged 7.8m viewers, a long way down from the peak of 14.4m in Season 5 and over 17m for a couple of season premieres.

The episode demonstrated the show's recent weaknesses (spoiler alert: do not read on if you have not watched the finale). More than two series had been devoted to the battle between the group of survivors led by Rick Grimes (pictured, right) and a rival band led by the baseball bat-wielding Negan (centre). Patient viewers were entitled to a climactic send-off. They saw one satisfying twist; Eugene, the eccentric mullet-haired boffin, turned out to be on the side of the angels after all, having sabotaged Negan's ammunition. But the final battle saw Rick slash Negan's throat, only to spare him in the memory of his dead son, Carl (pictured left). This left many viewers unsatisfied.

This behaviour reflected the see-saw mentality of Rick, who has switched from well-meaning statesman to bloodsoaked avenger, many times over the show's long run. The same erratic philosophy has been true of Carol and Morgan, two of the show's other original characters, who have alternated between the strategic approaches of Mahatma Gandhi and Genghis Khan.

Such problems bedevil extended series. Each episode must have something dramatic happen; there are only so many characters for whom the audience can feel sympathy. The result is that so much happens to each individual that narrative coherence and psychological plausibility fly out of the window (remember “Lost”?).

A fundamental problem for “The Walking Dead” is that the actions of zombies are limited to staggering about and biting. The dramatic focus has to be on the human survivors. But it is easy for the show to repeat itself. Rick and his band have wandered from place to place in search of safety—a farm, a prison, a small town—only for each to succumb to rival groups, zombie hordes or both.

With each series 16 episodes long, it is easy for some of the middle shows to seem like filler as the writers build to the final battle. The lead characters are clad in “plot armour”; bullets always miss them, villains opt for mercy rather than execution and so on. The show has attempted to maintain tension by periodically killing off key characters. Even here, viewers have felt cheated; in series 6, Glenn (played by Steven Yeun) appeared to be disembowelled by zombies. For a few episodes, his fate was unsure, leading the character to be dubbed “Schrödinger's Glenn”. He was reprieved, only to be a victim shortly afterwards of Negan's bat at the start of series 7. The show has never recovered.

The writers had the chance to revisit the concept in their spin-off series “Fear the Walking Dead” which has just started its fourth series. This began in Los Angeles before the apocalypse. Had the writers slowed the timeline, this could have been an intriguing portrait of societal breakdown. But instead the show took the Zombie Express to dystopia, creating another series with wandering characters behaving inexplicably.

To survive, both shows need to move in a new direction. Perhaps there could be sign of a cure, with the survivors setting off in search of some crucial ingredient, and persuading others to be vaccinated? Or perhaps a government (even a foreign power) could attempt to reimpose order, dividing the survivors between acceptance and resistance? Dead men need to tell more interesting tales.ON APRIL 13th, delegates of the International Maritime Organisation, the UN agency responsible for shipping safety and pollution, announced that 170 of its members had agreed to reduce carbon emissions from shipping to no more than half of 2008 levels by 2050. Shipping in Changing Climates, a research consortium, called the deal “major progress” towards bringing shipping in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But why has it taken two years after Paris to reach such a deal ?

Shipping and airlines were the only greenhouse-gas-emitting industries not mentioned in the Paris agreement. This was, in part, because assigning emissions is hard. To whom should you designate emissions for shipping Chinese goods, made with South Korean components, across the Pacific to American consumers? But similar problems did not stop airlines agreeing on an industry-wide limit within a year. Diplomats argue the slow progress is because any caps would affect exporters, too. If regulators move too aggressively they may reduce the competitiveness of seaborne trade. For instance, Brazil, a big exporter of iron ore to China, fears overzealous caps will drive shipping costs higher, helping its competitor, Australia, whose ores travel a quarter as far as Brazil’s. The idea of slowing vessels down draws ire from countries that export perishable goods, like cherries and grapes, as Chile does.

Others fear that powerful lobbyists have hijacked the process. Transparency International, an NGO, has raised “serious concerns” about the IMO being unusually influenced, for a UN body, by corporate interests. A report by InfluenceMap, a research firm, found that at a recent meeting of the agency 31% of nations were represented, in part, by direct business interests. The way the IMO is structured exacerbates these problems. The IMO is funded proportionately according to the tonnage shipped under a nation’s flag, so countries running “open registries”, which allow any shipowners to register under their flag (sometimes known as “flags of convenience”), have disproportionate influence. Sometimes this helps those keen to limit emissions, such as the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation, where 11% of all ships are registered and which is vociferous in its support of emissions cuts. But for the most part it works against them. Countries are beholden to ship owners, so those nations that are not about to disappear under the water themselves are often averse to any emissions cuts. Panama, where 18% of global ships are registered, supported a much less ambitious deal.

The IMO announcement also faced opposition from countries such as Saudi Arabia and America, who consistently oppose efforts to combat climate change (both refused to sign up to this deal). Even including the agreed cuts, shipping, which currently accounts for almost 3% of total global carbon emissions, will probably see its share of emissions rise in coming years. Technology could help. New design standards are already lowering harmful emissions. Zero-carbon fuels are becoming available. Reducing the speed at which ships travel by 10% could reduce fuel usage by almost a third. Last week’s agreement was a good start to encourage adoption of such changes. As with many such agreements, the implementation is all.A MILLION plastic bottles are sold every minute. Many are not recycled and of those that are, only a small fraction become bottles again. That is, in part, because recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the polymer used to make such bottles, back into material robust enough to hold, say, a fizzy drink, is hard. What would be helpful is a way to break down PET into the chemicals that made it in the first place. These could then be used to make new high-grade PET.

This week John McGeehan of the University of Portsmouth, in Britain, and his colleagues report details of a bacterial enzyme called “PETase” that can do just that. Furthermore, they have engineered a version of this enzyme that can digest plastic faster than the natural variety. Their work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

PETase is secreted by a plastic-munching bacterium called Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This bug was discovered in 2016 at a PET-bottle recycling plant in Sakai, Japan. The researchers behind its discovery showed that the enzyme degrades PET into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). A second enzyme then breaks MHET down further, into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The bacterium then uses these chemicals as food sources. The discoverers of PETase also suggested that it may have evolved from bacterial enzymes used to break down cutin, a waxy polymer that coats leaves. That is, in itself, remarkable—for PET has been used widely only since the 1970s, meaning that the enzyme must have evolved to do its job within the past 50 years.

I. sakaiensis digests PET far too slowly, however, to be of much use for industrial recycling of the plastic. To make it so requires understanding how the enzymes do their work. This is what Dr McGeehan and his colleagues set out to do. As MHET is far easier to break down by standard chemical means than PET, they focused on PETase.

They compared the DNA sequence of the PETase gene to that of cutinases from thousands of species of bacteria, looking for systematic differences. They then created new versions of PETase, each with one or more of its amino-acid building blocks changed to resemble those of ancestral cutinases.

As many of the differences between PETase and cutinases were, presumably, what allowed the PETase to do its job, they expected these new enzymes to digest the plastic less efficiently. To their surprise, however, one of the engineered enzymes (with two amino acids mutated to be more cutinase-like) was able to digest PET about 20% faster than the natural one. That is a modest increase, but one that came about by accident rather than design. This, Dr McGeehan argues, shows there is plenty of scope for further improvement.

The team determined the structures of their enzymes by protein crystallography, a technique that takes detailed pictures of a molecule by bombarding crystals of it with X-rays (in this case, at the Diamond Light Source, a machine in Oxfordshire that produces particularly strong X-rays for such purposes). They then used computer modelling to look at how a molecule of PET might dock with the enzyme’s active site—the region where the chemical reaction that breaks down the plastic actually occurs. The more-efficient enzyme they engineered appears to hold the plastic molecule more snugly in the active site than the naturally occurring version.

Interesting though all this is, there is still much to do before PETase can become a useful enzyme. At the moment, a litre of a solution of even the improved enzyme would break down just a few milligrams of plastic per day. Its plastic-digesting ability must therefore be improved by a hundredfold or more to be commercially useful.

This the team hopes to do, in part, by using clues from the enzyme’s structure. Further improvements could come by designing the enzyme to work at temperatures above 70ºC, when PET becomes rubbery, and thus more easily digestible. Bacteria that live in hot springs, and that have cutinases that function at such temperatures, might be pressed into service here. The gene for the enzyme would also have to be transplanted into bacteria that can be grown easily at industrial scales. If these hurdles can be surmounted, though, PETase might make a dent in the scourge of plastic waste.The Advanced Project Scheduling online course goes beyond simple scheduling techniques to demonstrate how to develop a Schedule Model that can be used to create a reliable, accurate Schedule Baseline.
