IT WAS a “big win” tweeted Donald Trump on April 25th, as he congratulated the Republican winner of a special congressional election in Arizona’s eighth district. And yet, he complained: “Press is so silent”. Neither of these claims was true. The media has been pouring over the outcome of a race, in a staunchly conservative district on the edge of Phoenix, that would normally deliver a boringly predictable Republican win. That is because the Republican victory there was much narrower than usual.

In the election to find a successor to Trent Franks, who resigned in December following allegations he had asked a female staffer to be the surrogate mother of his child, the victor, a former state senator called Debbie Lesko, beat her Democratic opponent, Hiral Tipirneni, a political newcomer, by only five percentage points: by 53% to 47%. This was in a district that voted for Mr Trump in 2016 by a 21-point margin.

The Republican Party, fearing an embarrassing upset in a district which the Democrats did not bother to contest in Mr Franks's last two races, had worked unprecedentedly hard for Ms Lesko's win. Outside Democratic outfits pretty well ignored the race, while Republican groups splurged over a million dollars on it. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and other Republican leaders hosted fundraisers for Ms Lesko. Mr Trump recorded robocalls for her—vote Republican, he thundered, or “illegal immigrants will pour right over your border”. And Ms Lesko, an affable and locally-popular mother of three, was a pretty strong candidate for the eighth.

Her poor showing, despite all of that, is yet another indicator of the headwinds Republicans face as they gear up for the midterms in November. American voters have a history of cutting the president’s party down to size in midterms, especially when it controls all the levers of power, and even more so when the president is unpopular. The Republicans control every elected branch; and, a little over a year into his tenure, Mr Trump is the most unpopular president since polling records began. That is why the result on April 24th was so close. According to Fivethirtyeight, a data journalism website, her victory represented a 20-point swing towards Democrats relative to the district’s partisan lean (a measure based on how it voted for president in 2016 and 2012 relative to the country). That was at least better than her party colleague Rick Saccone managed in Pennsylvania’s 18th district last month; the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, won it on the back of a 22-point swing.

Thanks partly to rampant gerrymandering and a dwindling number of generally competitive seats, the midterms might not deliver their usual anti-incumbent thumping this year. And politics is never predictable, of course. Nonetheless, most of the evidence suggests that a big blue wave is surging towards the Republican beach. The Cook Report reckons that about 147 Republican districts are more competitive than Arizona’s eighth. “If the only data point you had to go on was last night’s #AZ08 result, you’d think a 30-40 seat Dem House gain in Nov. would be way low,” tweeted David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report on April 25th. Democrats need 23 seats to take the House.A PILLAR of stability, Lee Hsien Loong, son of Singapore’s independence leader, Lee Kuan Yew, has run the country since 2004. Despite a decline in his party’s popularity, the manicured electoral system has returned him to office time and again, most recently in 2015. The country is now more than halfway to the next election, which must be held in 2021 at the latest. As it nears, a tricky subject looms: who will replace Mr Lee? He plans to stand once more before stepping down as prime minister ahead of his 70th birthday in 2022. The question has the government on edge.

Mr Lee will almost certainly win the next election. The ruling People’s Action Party has held power since before independence more than half a century ago. It holds 83 of the 89 elected seats in Singapore’s parliament. Predicting the identity of the next prime minister is trickier. But a cabinet reshuffle this week provided clues. Three older ministers, all in their sixties, stepped down. Younger colleagues were awarded more responsibilities.

Mr Lee’s possible successors include Heng Swee Keat (pictured), the finance minister, Ong Ye Kung, the education minister and Chan Chun Sing, newly promoted from the prime minister’s office to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Mr Heng, who has led the education ministry and the Monetary Authority of Singapore as well as serving as an aide to Mr Lee’s father, is regarded as the frontrunner. One former official praises him for his growing ease in the public eye despite not being “a natural politician”. Wonkishness does not tend to hold Singaporean politicians back. His health, however, might: he suffered a stroke in 2016.

Public opinion is unlikely to play much part in the decision. In fact, the government is further crimping freedom of speech in a country not exactly known for it. In March parliament passed the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill, which allows police to ban the dissemination of videos or pictures of certain events. The sorts of incidents that qualify range from terrorist attacks to demonstrations that block pavements or disrupt business. Plans to put cameras linked to facial-recognition software atop more than 100,000 lampposts will further discourage even the most respectable protests. Social media are also being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee which wants to fight “deliberate online falsehoods”. Whoever ends up in charge, the government will be well defended against unruly critics.THE young French president, Emmanuel Macron, turned up in Washington, DC, this week for his state visit keen to make something of the oddly close link he has forged with Donald Trump. Top of his list was an effort to persuade the American leader not to walk away from the Iran nuclear agreement. Mr Trump has threatened to do this on May 12th, and may well still do so. Yet, for the first time, the American president hinted that he might be interested in a European idea, promoted by the French president, of brokering an add-on deal to cover wider American concerns about Iran. If this can keep Mr Trump on board, it would be a big diplomatic coup for Mr Macron.

The French president’s proposal is one that France, Britain and Germany have been working on closely together. The idea would be to widen the existing agreement, made in 2015 with the Europeans, Russia, America and China, with a side deal. This would cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its regional interference, as well as extend beyond 2025 Iran’s commitment to curb its nuclear activities. Though Mr Trump, standing next to Mr Macron in Washington, this week called the existing deal “insane” and “ridiculous”, he also hinted that there was some common ground between them. “I think,” said Mr Trump, “we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger, maybe, deal.”

Given the American president’s volatility and his team’s hostility to any compromise over Iran, this is a gamble for Mr Macron. Indeed, since he was elected a year ago, he has invested much in trying to use his warm relationship with the American leader to win him round, on matters from climate to trade, tolerating strange moments of public humiliation in the process. At one point in the Oval office this week, the American president flicked what he called “dandruff” from Mr Macron’s collar, declaring: “We have to make him perfect.” At another, he appeared to tug Mr Macron along like a dog.

The pair make a decidedly odd couple. It is hard to imagine two Western leaders with more contrasting world views. The host, a brash former reality-television star was elected on a promise to shut borders and spurn multilateralism. The guest, a cerebral philosophy graduate, won power by rejecting nationalism and praising Europe and the liberal world order. Yet the pair seem to have found a certain respect for each other, ever since Mr Macron gave Mr Trump a knuckle-crunching handshake when they first met a year ago. Each is a political outsider—a “maverick”, in Mr Macron’s words—who won power against the odds. For Mr Macron, the summit was a chance to show the world that France still counts and his citizens that it is still capable of grandeur. For Mr Trump, it is gratifying to have a smart, dynamic young leader flatteringly wanting to be his friend. Some call Mr Macron the “Trump whisperer”.

By staking so much on the Iran deal, Mr Macron has put his credibility as an emerging European leader on the line. He certainly does not seek to align himself unconditionally with Mr Trump, although France took part in—and indeed pushed for—recent air strikes with America and Britain against Syrian chemical-weapons facilities. Rather, the French president’s ambition is, at best, to encourage the American leader to use his country’s influence in a more benign way and at least to keep him from inflicting too much damage.

So far, the French seem happy to let Mr Macron make a go of this relationship. The French generally prefer their leaders to project the country’s independence, as did de Gaulle, and pillory those who cosy up to Americans, as did Nicolas Sarkozy to George W. Bush. As Mr Macron prepares to mark the first anniversary of his election on May 7th, he is not popular at home. Yet most people like the way he has changed the country’s image abroad. His talk of grandeur and prestige goes down well, and the prospect of France acting as Europe’s preferred leader in Washington seems to make up for popular distaste for Mr Trump.

At some point, however, there will be domestic pressure on Mr Macron to show something in return for all this Trump-flattery. He has on occasion exaggerated his influence over his American counterpart. But he also knows that their differences are great and, at times, insurmountable. “Sometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail,” Mr Macron said earlier this year. The best the French president may be able to hope for is to tame Mr Trump’s wilder instincts and keep him at least listening to those inside the Western liberal-democratic club. For now, Mr Macron looks like the smartest European handler of the tricky American president. In the longer run, if he cannot secure tangible returns for his efforts, he will run the risk of looking naive, or foolish, or both.ON APRIL 24th, Donald Trump suffered a third setback to his effort to undo Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The programme, introduced by Barack Obama in 2012, shields undocumented immigrants brought to America as children from deportation. Twice in recent months, federal judges in California and New York have concluded that Mr Trump’s decision in September 2017 to ditch DACA was illegal. Both rulings effectively wiped out the end-date of March 5th the Trump administration set in the autumn.

The decision this week from Judge John Bates goes further than either of the previous injunctions. As well as requiring Mr Trump to process renewals of existing DACA enrollees, Judge Bates orders the president to invite and approve first-time applications from so-called Dreamers who have yet to register for the programme.

Judge Bates grounded his ruling in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a federal law that sets protocols for agencies when they adopt a new rule or abandon an old one. He noted that “[t]he APA generally requires notice-and-comment procedures”—an opportunity for the public to weigh in on a change—”whenever an agency creates, amends, or repeals a rule”, but agreed with the government that Mr Trump’s DACA announcement did not in fact require this due to an exception in the APA. Nevertheless, Judge Bates chided the government for failing to provide a sound justification for the change. In the words of the APA, agencies may not alter rules for reasons that are “arbitrary and capricious”.

Neither of Mr Trump’s stated reasons for dropping DACA, the judge found, passed muster. First, in the announcement in September 2017, Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, said that Mr Obama’s programme was unlawful and unconstitutional. But this conclusion is “erroneous”, Judge Bates found, and was based on “scant legal reasoning”. The meagre justification was “particularly egregious”, he wrote, “in light of the reliance interests involved”. In undoing the protections, the government “made no mention of the fact that DACA had been in place for five years and had engendered the reliance of hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, many of whom had structured their education, employment, and other life activities on the assumption that they would be able to renew their DACA benefits”. Mr Trump’s second justification for scrapping DACA—a fear of lawsuits—was equally weak in Judge Bates’s view. Worries over “threatened litigation over DACA’s validity...was so implausible that it fails even under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard”.

So what is to be done? Judge Bates takes what he calls an “intermediate course”: halting the rescission of DACA but staying that order for 90 days. In the intervening three months, the executive branch “may reissue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller explanation for the determination that the program lacks statutory and constitutional authority”. If such a memo is presented to the court, and Judge Bates finds it less laughable than the 2017 memo, Mr Trump may go ahead with his wish to rescind protections for young immigrants. But barring that, “the original DACA programme will be restored in full”; the government will be ordered to “resume accepting initial DACA applications and applications for advanced parole”.

This is a silver lining for the Trump administration. Yes, Judge Bates criticised the rollback as “virtually unexplained” and obliquely scolded the Trump administration for being callous. But in delaying the implementation of his order, he suggested one example of how DACA could be legitimately ended. It is no good to say that a worry about being sued, by itself, justifies scrapping the programme. But the government “could conclude”, he wrote, “that the costs of defending the policy in court would outweigh its benefits to the public, or that the negative publicity that would surround the litigation would undermine the policy’s effectiveness”. This cost-benefit analysis may be an acceptable reason to end the policy, as it would make “the decision to rescind…’discretionary’ in a meaningful sense”.

How will the Trump administration react? In previous legal setbacks, Mr Trump has taken to Twitter to express his displeasure with judges meddling with his policies. At times he has attacked judges personally, calling one jurist who ruled against his first travel-ban order a “so-called judge”. But an ad hominem attack on Judge Bates will be hard to sustain: he was appointed to his seat by George W. Bush in 2001 and, from 1995 to 1997, served under Kenneth Starr in the investigation that led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He is no leftie. But he pulled no punches in an opinion that is sure to enrage a president who rankles at judicial oversight.THE late Hans Rosling is best known for his Ted talks (here is one on the wonders of the washing machine). Sadly he died last year. But before he did so, he worked with his son and daughter-in-law to write “Factfulness: Ten Reasons Why We’re Wrong About the World—And Why Things Are Better Than You Think.” It is a wonderful book, full of humour and humility, and it paints an optimistic picture of progress.

Take his 13-question test and you will probably be surprised. For example, has the proportion of people in the world living in extreme poverty over the last 20 years almost doubled, stayed the same, or almost halved? Over the last 100 years, has the number of deaths per year from natural disasters more than doubled, stayed the same or more than halved? In both cases, the answer is the most optimistic one; the latter statistic is particularly remarkable given the increase in the size of the population over the past century.

Perhaps because the news media focuses on bad news, and because political unrest in the rich world has grown so much, it is easy to miss the very good story that has been happening in Asia and elsewhere over the past 30 years. In part, this is down to the escape from baleful ideology. To quote Stephen Radelet’s “The Great Surge”:

In 1976, Mao single-handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one simple act: he died.

Mr Rosling had little truck with those who would deny the benefits of industrialisation (including washing machines) to those living in poor countries. But his great gift was to deliver his data with clarity and simplicity; “Factfulness” is as far from a dry economics textbook as you can imagine. That made me turn my mind, for another farewell blog, to other books on finance and economics that were both readable and insightful. What follows is an eclectic list, in alphabetic order by author surname.

Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson. The best explanation of the “institutional” school of economics. Why “inclusive institutions” promote growth and extractive ones don’t.

Lords of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed. This is the story of the Great Depression as told through the lives of the central bankers who tried and failed to deal with the crisis. As one, Montagu Norman, reflected in retirement, “nothing that I did had...any effect at all except that we collected money from a lot of poor devils and gave it over to the four winds.”

The Great Convergence by Richard Baldwin. An essential book for understanding how modern trade works via global supply chains. An antidote to the protectionist nonsense being peddled by some politicians today.

A Splendid Exchange by William Bernstein. If the Baldwin book doesn’t convince you of the importance of trade, this account of its historical role should. It is no coincidence that the greater prosperity of mankind, as noted by Mr Roslin, has occurred in an era of greater trading links.

Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond. An alternative to the Acemoglu/Robinson thesis. Economic history owes a lot to geographic endowment; for example, Africa lacked large mammals that could be domesticated.

Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Is it about economics, finance or psychology? That doesn’t matter. It is a fascinating account of the flawed way we think and why this can lead to costly mistakes.

Other People’s Money by John Kay. The best analytic look at the financial crisis by an academic and Financial Times columnist. It skewers the finance sector’s pretensions. “A country can be prosperous only if it has a well-functioning financial system, but that does not imply that the larger the financial system a country has, the more prosperous it is likely to be.”

While America Aged by Roger Lowenstein. It is hard to get people interested in pensions but this book, by the author of “When Genius Failed”, is the best effort I have seen. It shows how executives and politicians were happy to make promises that would take decades to redeem but were unwilling to fund them properly.

Too Big To Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin. Suffers slightly from the “at 8.22, his BMW drove up the 600 foot gravel drive” school of journalism. But still a compelling and dramatic read on how the titans of Wall Street and Washington coped with the 2008 crisis.

Where are the Customers’ Yachts? by Fred Schwed, Jr. A cynical look at Wall Street, published back in 1940. The message is still relevant today when one of the easiest ways to get rich is to manage other people's money.

Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller. He may have been early but Professor Shiller forecast both the end of the dotcom bubble and the housing crash. The book should be read by anyone who thinks valuations don’t matter.

Americana by Bhu Srinivasan. This book combines lovely writing with a wonderful structure. Four hundred years of American economic history as told through a succession of chapters on subjects like slavery and retailing.

An Edible History of Humanity by Tom Standage. Yes, it is written by a colleague but it is an entertaining tour of history via the food we eat and the agricultural techniques we used. Since agriculture dominated the economy until the 19th century, this is essential economic history

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The first, and best, of Mr Taleb’s books. A reflection on the misunderstood role of probability in finance and in life.

Readers may already own some of the above, but probably not all of them. They will keep you occupied on those sunny summer evenings and long plane rides.THE 1960s and 1970s were a golden age of Pakistani cinema. Hundreds of popular films were produced yearly by Lollywood, the Lahore-based entertainment industry. The era’s stars included Waheed Murad, a heartthrob, and Sabiha Khanoum, known as the first lady of Pakistani screens. Both continue to be revered today. Murad’s 1966 film “Armaan” (“Desire”) introduced audiences to the first South Asian pop song, creating a new genre of Pakistani music.

But for all its former glory, production in Lollywood collapsed by the end of the 1990s. By 2005, barely 20 local films were released annually. Political turmoil triggered the decline. General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in 1977 in a military coup. The new president proceeded to enforce an Islamisation agenda, under which film-makers were forced to comply with strict censorship. Projects could be banned if deemed prejudicial to all manner of interests, including decency, morality and the public good. With little to screen and unable to compete with home entertainment, hundreds of cinemas were shuttered.

Further absurdities awaited. Producers could only work if they had an academic degree and all had to register with the ministry of culture. Heavy entertainment taxes were introduced, and investment dried up as profits fell. Indian films were banned, and eventually the number of Pakistani Urdu films dwindled. Pakistani audiences, starved of entertainment, were pacified only by the arrival of the VCR. A thriving black market for Bollywood videotapes soon developed, and many Pakistanis grew up watching pirated films from across the border.

But a new generation of directors and producers is now leading Lollywood’s recovery. The nickname has endured, but little else remains the same. Production has moved from Lahore to the coastal city of Karachi. The ban on Indian films was lifted, and it is these and Western offerings that keep Pakistan’s cinemas open today. But Pakistani films are, slowly, returning to the screen.

Shoaib Mansoor is the director credited with reversing the film industry’s fortunes, but his reputation is partly built on savvy marketing. In 2007 his film “Khuda Kay Liye” (“The Name of God”) was advertised as marking the official revival of Pakistani cinema. The move was a public relations masterstroke that took advantage of softening government control and tapped into a public hunger for local films.

“Khuda Kay Liye” follows the lives two young Pakistani men in the aftermath of 9/11. The film is darker than classic films, and the plot is sometimes convoluted. Yet Mr Mansoor found an audience eager for a modern Pakistani Urdu production and the film played to packed cinemas. Pakistani audiences had been promised a revival, and by showing up to cinemas across the country, they made it happen.

Mr Mansoor followed up with “Bol” (“Speak”) and 2017’s “Verna”. Both focus on gender issues, and the latter triggered a national debate. The plot of “Verna” follows a sexual assault survivor, a subject that caused enormous political controversy after Pakistan’s censor board took issue with what it called “edgy content”, and considered banning the film. The ensuing debate touched a public nerve, as it coincided with widespread protests held over the rape and murder of Zainab Ansari, a seven-year-old girl. When it was eventually screened, the film’s skewering of misogyny was applauded. Mr Mansoor typically focuses on content over style, choosing to pack his films with social criticism, sometimes to a fault. Both “Verna” and “Bol” were criticised for erratic pacing and weak cinematography.

But Mr Mansoor’s example has been followed and improved on by other directors. “Cake” (see picture), directed by Asim Abbasi, was released at the end of March. It’s a far cry from 1960s films, known for their melodrama and impressive song and dance numbers, yet is all the better for this. The plot revolves around the lives of two sisters caring for their ailing parents. One has remained in Pakistan and the other has just returned from Britain, a common scenario in Pakistan’s wealthier neighbourhoods (accordingly, critics have praised it for its realism). Mr Abbasi focuses on the conflicted relationship between the two women as they gather to celebrate their parents’ wedding anniversary, and neither muffles their anger nor exaggerates their rivalry. Refreshingly, their romantic ties remain secondary. “Cake” became the first Pakistani film to premiere at London’s Leicester Square.

Much work remains to be done. Pakistan’s Central Board of Film Censors continues to wield enormous power over which films are seen. And although the rising numbers of subversive films are encouraging, the social consequences of their release fall disproportionately on the women involved. The lead role in “Verna” was played by Mahira Khan, who has long been a target for sexist trolls online. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, an Oscar-winning documentary maker, has faced similar problems for her work on honour killings and acid attacks.

But despite the obstacles, a resurgence is finally underway in Lollywood. Fresh-faced directors such as Mr Abbasi have access to high production budgets, talented casts and scripts that avoid clichés. The new wave of Pakistani cinema may well eclipse its golden age.











ONE of the great riddles about the American economy is why its growth has slowed down so much during the past few decades. Between 1946 and 1975, America’s GDP per person grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% a year. On average, it has grown by just 1.8% a year since.

Many economists believe that national accounts may underestimate the economic significance of technological innovations. Despite the advent of the internet, smartphones and artificial intelligence, the official value added by the information industry as a share of GDP has scarcely changed since 2000. What might explain this paradox?

Part of the problem is that GDP as a measure only takes into account goods and services that people pay money for. Internet firms like Google and Facebook do not charge consumers for access, which means that national-income statistics will underestimate how much consumers have benefitted from their rise.

One way to quantify how much these internet services are worth is by asking people how much money they would have to be paid to forgo using them for a year. A new working paper by Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni, three economists, does exactly this and finds that the value for consumers of some internet services can be substantial. Survey respondents said that they would have to be paid $3,600 to give up internet maps for a year, and $8,400 to give up e-mail. Search engines appear to be especially valuable: consumers surveyed said that they would have to be paid $17,500 to forgo their use for a year.A ROYAL birth is always heralded with great fanfare, and the arrival of the Duchess of Cambridge’s third baby on April 23rd was no exception. Throngs of reporters waited for updates outside the Lindo Wing, a luxurious private maternity ward in London that has often been used by the royals and which boasts a comprehensive wine list for celebrating parents.

Yet the price of delivering the new prince, who is fifth in line to the British throne, was probably slightly less than that of an average American baby. In 2015, the Lindo Wing charged £5,670 ($8,900) for 24 hours in a deluxe room and a non-Caesarean delivery. A survey in the same year by the International Federation of Health Plans found that the average fee for such a delivery in the United States was $10,808. That rises to roughly $30,000 after accounting for care given before and after a pregnancy, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers cover most of the cost, but parents are still left with an average bill of about $3,000. In many European countries, free maternity care is available.A WAVE of automation anxiety has hit the West. Just try typing “Will machines…” into Google. An algorithm offers to complete the sentence with differing degrees of disquiet: “...take my job?”; “...take all jobs?”; “...replace humans?”; “...take over the world?”

Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction. In 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University used—what else?—a machine-learning algorithm to assess how easily 702 different kinds of job in America could be automated. They concluded that fully 47% could be done by machines “over the next decade or two”.













A new working paper by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, employs a similar approach, looking at other developed economies. Its technique differs from Mr Frey and Mr Osborne’s study by assessing the automatability of each task within a given job, based on a survey of skills in 2015. Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly vulnerable, defined as having at least a 70% chance of automation. A further 32% were slightly less imperilled, with a probability between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries in the study.

The pain will not be shared evenly. The study finds large variation across countries: jobs in Slovakia are twice as vulnerable as those in Norway. In general, workers in rich countries appear less at risk than those in middle-income ones. But wide gaps exist even between countries of similar wealth.

Differences in organisational structure and industry mix both play a role, but the former matters more. In South Korea, for example, 30% of jobs are in manufacturing, compared with 22% in Canada. Nonetheless, on average, Korean jobs are harder to automate than Canadian ones are. This may be because Korean employers have found better ways to combine, in the same job, and without reducing productivity, both routine tasks and social and creative ones, which computers or robots cannot do. A gloomier explanation would be “survivor bias”: the jobs that remain in Korea appear harder to automate only because Korean firms have already handed most of the easily automatable jobs to machines.THE young French president, Emmanuel Macron, turned up in Washington, DC, this week for his state visit keen to make something of the oddly close link he has forged with Donald Trump.

In the longer run, if he cannot secure tangible returns for his efforts, he will run the risk of looking naive, or foolish, or both.A PILLAR of stability, Lee Hsien Loong, son of Singapore’s independence leader, Lee Kuan Yew, has run the country since 2004. Despite a decline in his party’s popularity, the manicured electoral system has returned him to office time and again, most recently in 2015. The country is now more than halfway to the next election, which must be held in 2021 at the latest. As it nears, a tricky subject looms: who will replace Mr Lee? He plans to stand once more before stepping down as prime minister ahead of his 70th birthday in 2022. The question has the government on edge.

Mr Lee will almost certainly win the next election. The ruling People’s Action Party has held power since before independence more than half a century ago. It holds 83 of the 89 elected seats in Singapore’s parliament. Predicting the identity of the next prime minister is trickier. But a cabinet reshuffle this week provided clues. Three older ministers, all in their sixties, stepped down. Younger colleagues were awarded more responsibilities.

Mr Lee’s possible successors include Heng Swee Keat (pictured), the finance minister, Ong Ye Kung, the education minister and Chan Chun Sing, newly promoted from the prime minister’s office to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Mr Heng, who has led the education ministry and the Monetary Authority of Singapore as well as serving as an aide to Mr Lee’s father, is regarded as the frontrunner. One former official praises him for his growing ease in the public eye despite not being “a natural politician”. Wonkishness does not tend to hold Singaporean politicians back. His health, however, might: he suffered a stroke in 2016.

Public opinion is unlikely to play much part in the decision. In fact, the government is further crimping freedom of speech in a country not exactly known for it. In March parliament passed the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill, which allows police to ban the dissemination of videos or pictures of certain events. The sorts of incidents that qualify range from terrorist attacks to demonstrations that block pavements or disrupt business. Plans to put cameras linked to facial-recognition software atop more than 100,000 lampposts will further discourage even the most respectable protests. Social media are also being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee which wants to fight “deliberate online falsehoods”. Whoever ends up in charge, the government will be well defended against unruly critics.IT WAS a “big win” tweeted Donald Trump on April 25th, as he congratulated the Republican winner of a special congressional election in Arizona’s eighth district. And yet, he complained: “Press is so silent”. Neither of these claims was true. The media has been pouring over the outcome of a race, in a staunchly conservative district on the edge of Phoenix, that would normally deliver a boringly predictable Republican win. That is because the Republican victory there was much narrower than usual.

In the election to find a successor to Trent Franks, who resigned in December following allegations he had asked a female staffer to be the surrogate mother of his child, the victor, a former state senator called Debbie Lesko, beat her Democratic opponent, Hiral Tipirneni, a political newcomer, by only five percentage points: by 53% to 47%. This was in a district that voted for Mr Trump in 2016 by a 21-point margin.

The Republican Party, fearing an embarrassing upset in a district which the Democrats did not bother to contest in Mr Franks's last two races, had worked unprecedentedly hard for Ms Lesko's win. Outside Democratic outfits pretty well ignored the race, while Republican groups splurged over a million dollars on it. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and other Republican leaders hosted fundraisers for Ms Lesko. Mr Trump recorded robocalls for her—vote Republican, he thundered, or “illegal immigrants will pour right over your border”. And Ms Lesko, an affable and locally-popular mother of three, was a pretty strong candidate for the eighth.

Her poor showing, despite all of that, is yet another indicator of the headwinds Republicans face as they gear up for the midterms in November. American voters have a history of cutting the president’s party down to size in midterms, especially when it controls all the levers of power, and even more so when the president is unpopular. The Republicans control every elected branch; and, a little over a year into his tenure, Mr Trump is the most unpopular president since polling records began. That is why the result on April 24th was so close. According to Fivethirtyeight, a data journalism website, her victory represented a 20-point swing towards Democrats relative to the district’s partisan lean (a measure based on how it voted for president in 2016 and 2012 relative to the country). That was at least better than her party colleague Rick Saccone managed in Pennsylvania’s 18th district last month; the Democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, won it on the back of a 22-point swing.

Thanks partly to rampant gerrymandering and a dwindling number of generally competitive seats, the midterms might not deliver their usual anti-incumbent thumping this year. And politics is never predictable, of course. Nonetheless, most of the evidence suggests that a big blue wave is surging towards the Republican beach. The Cook Report reckons that about 147 Republican districts are more competitive than Arizona’s eighth. “If the only data point you had to go on was last night’s #AZ08 result, you’d think a 30-40 seat Dem House gain in Nov. would be way low,” tweeted David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report on April 25th. Democrats need 23 seats to take the House.ON APRIL 24th, Donald Trump suffered a third setback to his effort to undo Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The programme, introduced by Barack Obama in 2012, shields undocumented immigrants brought to America as children from deportation. Twice in recent months, federal judges in California and New York have concluded that Mr Trump’s decision in September 2017 to ditch DACA was illegal. Both rulings effectively wiped out the end-date of March 5th the Trump administration set in the autumn.

The decision this week from Judge John Bates goes further than either of the previous injunctions. As well as requiring Mr Trump to process renewals of existing DACA enrollees, Judge Bates orders the president to invite and approve first-time applications from so-called Dreamers who have yet to register for the programme.

Judge Bates grounded his ruling in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a federal law that sets protocols for agencies when they adopt a new rule or abandon an old one. He noted that “[t]he APA generally requires notice-and-comment procedures”—an opportunity for the public to weigh in on a change—”whenever an agency creates, amends, or repeals a rule”, but agreed with the government that Mr Trump’s DACA announcement did not in fact require this due to an exception in the APA. Nevertheless, Judge Bates chided the government for failing to provide a sound justification for the change. In the words of the APA, agencies may not alter rules for reasons that are “arbitrary and capricious”.

Neither of Mr Trump’s stated reasons for dropping DACA, the judge found, passed muster. First, in the announcement in September 2017, Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general, said that Mr Obama’s programme was unlawful and unconstitutional. But this conclusion is “erroneous”, Judge Bates found, and was based on “scant legal reasoning”. The meagre justification was “particularly egregious”, he wrote, “in light of the reliance interests involved”. In undoing the protections, the government “made no mention of the fact that DACA had been in place for five years and had engendered the reliance of hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, many of whom had structured their education, employment, and other life activities on the assumption that they would be able to renew their DACA benefits”. Mr Trump’s second justification for scrapping DACA—a fear of lawsuits—was equally weak in Judge Bates’s view. Worries over “threatened litigation over DACA’s validity...was so implausible that it fails even under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard”.

So what is to be done? Judge Bates takes what he calls an “intermediate course”: halting the rescission of DACA but staying that order for 90 days. In the intervening three months, the executive branch “may reissue a memorandum rescinding DACA, this time providing a fuller explanation for the determination that the program lacks statutory and constitutional authority”. If such a memo is presented to the court, and Judge Bates finds it less laughable than the 2017 memo, Mr Trump may go ahead with his wish to rescind protections for young immigrants. But barring that, “the original DACA programme will be restored in full”; the government will be ordered to “resume accepting initial DACA applications and applications for advanced parole”.

This is a silver lining for the Trump administration. Yes, Judge Bates criticised the rollback as “virtually unexplained” and obliquely scolded the Trump administration for being callous. But in delaying the implementation of his order, he suggested one example of how DACA could be legitimately ended. It is no good to say that a worry about being sued, by itself, justifies scrapping the programme. But the government “could conclude”, he wrote, “that the costs of defending the policy in court would outweigh its benefits to the public, or that the negative publicity that would surround the litigation would undermine the policy’s effectiveness”. This cost-benefit analysis may be an acceptable reason to end the policy, as it would make “the decision to rescind…’discretionary’ in a meaningful sense”.

How will the Trump administration react? In previous legal setbacks, Mr Trump has taken to Twitter to express his displeasure with judges meddling with his policies. At times he has attacked judges personally, calling one jurist who ruled against his first travel-ban order a “so-called judge”. But an ad hominem attack on Judge Bates will be hard to sustain: he was appointed to his seat by George W. Bush in 2001 and, from 1995 to 1997, served under Kenneth Starr in the investigation that led to Bill Clinton’s impeachment. He is no leftie. But he pulled no punches in an opinion that is sure to enrage a president who rankles at judicial oversight.THE late Hans Rosling is best known for his Ted talks (here is one on the wonders of the washing machine). Sadly he died last year. But before he did so, he worked with his son and daughter-in-law to write “Factfulness: Ten Reasons Why We’re Wrong About the World—And Why Things Are Better Than You Think.” It is a wonderful book, full of humour and humility, and it paints an optimistic picture of progress.

Take his 13-question test and you will probably be surprised. For example, has the proportion of people in the world living in extreme poverty over the last 20 years almost doubled, stayed the same, or almost halved? Over the last 100 years, has the number of deaths per year from natural disasters more than doubled, stayed the same or more than halved? In both cases, the answer is the most optimistic one; the latter statistic is particularly remarkable given the increase in the size of the population over the past century.

Perhaps because the news media focuses on bad news, and because political unrest in the rich world has grown so much, it is easy to miss the very good story that has been happening in Asia and elsewhere over the past 30 years. In part, this is down to the escape from baleful ideology. To quote Stephen Radelet’s “The Great Surge”:

In 1976, Mao single-handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one simple act: he died.

Mr Rosling had little truck with those who would deny the benefits of industrialisation (including washing machines) to those living in poor countries. But his great gift was to deliver his data with clarity and simplicity; “Factfulness” is as far from a dry economics textbook as you can imagine. That made me turn my mind, for another farewell blog, to other books on finance and economics that were both readable and insightful. What follows is an eclectic list, in alphabetic order by author surname.

Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson. The best explanation of the “institutional” school of economics. Why “inclusive institutions” promote growth and extractive ones don’t.

Lords of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed. This is the story of the Great Depression as told through the lives of the central bankers who tried and failed to deal with the crisis. As one, Montagu Norman, reflected in retirement, “nothing that I did had...any effect at all except that we collected money from a lot of poor devils and gave it over to the four winds.”

The Great Convergence by Richard Baldwin. An essential book for understanding how modern trade works via global supply chains. An antidote to the protectionist nonsense being peddled by some politicians today.

A Splendid Exchange by William Bernstein. If the Baldwin book doesn’t convince you of the importance of trade, this account of its historical role should. It is no coincidence that the greater prosperity of mankind, as noted by Mr Roslin, has occurred in an era of greater trading links.

Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond. An alternative to the Acemoglu/Robinson thesis. Economic history owes a lot to geographic endowment; for example, Africa lacked large mammals that could be domesticated.

Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Is it about economics, finance or psychology? That doesn’t matter. It is a fascinating account of the flawed way we think and why this can lead to costly mistakes.

Other People’s Money by John Kay. The best analytic look at the financial crisis by an academic and Financial Times columnist. It skewers the finance sector’s pretensions. “A country can be prosperous only if it has a well-functioning financial system, but that does not imply that the larger the financial system a country has, the more prosperous it is likely to be.”

While America Aged by Roger Lowenstein. It is hard to get people interested in pensions but this book, by the author of “When Genius Failed”, is the best effort I have seen. It shows how executives and politicians were happy to make promises that would take decades to redeem but were unwilling to fund them properly.

Too Big To Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin. Suffers slightly from the “at 8.22, his BMW drove up the 600 foot gravel drive” school of journalism. But still a compelling and dramatic read on how the titans of Wall Street and Washington coped with the 2008 crisis.

Where are the Customers’ Yachts? by Fred Schwed, Jr. A cynical look at Wall Street, published back in 1940. The message is still relevant today when one of the easiest ways to get rich is to manage other people's money.

Irrational Exuberance by Robert Shiller. He may have been early but Professor Shiller forecast both the end of the dotcom bubble and the housing crash. The book should be read by anyone who thinks valuations don’t matter.

Americana by Bhu Srinivasan. This book combines lovely writing with a wonderful structure. Four hundred years of American economic history as told through a succession of chapters on subjects like slavery and retailing.

An Edible History of Humanity by Tom Standage. Yes, it is written by a colleague but it is an entertaining tour of history via the food we eat and the agricultural techniques we used. Since agriculture dominated the economy until the 19th century, this is essential economic history

Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The first, and best, of Mr Taleb’s books. A reflection on the misunderstood role of probability in finance and in life.

Readers may already own some of the above, but probably not all of them. They will keep you occupied on those sunny summer evenings and long plane rides.THE 1960s and 1970s were a golden age of Pakistani cinema. Hundreds of popular films were produced yearly by Lollywood, the Lahore-based entertainment industry. The era’s stars included Waheed Murad, a heartthrob, and Sabiha Khanoum, known as the first lady of Pakistani screens. Both continue to be revered today. Murad’s 1966 film “Armaan” (“Desire”) introduced audiences to the first South Asian pop song, creating a new genre of Pakistani music.

But for all its former glory, production in Lollywood collapsed by the end of the 1990s. By 2005, barely 20 local films were released annually. Political turmoil triggered the decline. General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in 1977 in a military coup. The new president proceeded to enforce an Islamisation agenda, under which film-makers were forced to comply with strict censorship. Projects could be banned if deemed prejudicial to all manner of interests, including decency, morality and the public good. With little to screen and unable to compete with home entertainment, hundreds of cinemas were shuttered.

Further absurdities awaited. Producers could only work if they had an academic degree and all had to register with the ministry of culture. Heavy entertainment taxes were introduced, and investment dried up as profits fell. Indian films were banned, and eventually the number of Pakistani Urdu films dwindled. Pakistani audiences, starved of entertainment, were pacified only by the arrival of the VCR. A thriving black market for Bollywood videotapes soon developed, and many Pakistanis grew up watching pirated films from across the border.

But a new generation of directors and producers is now leading Lollywood’s recovery. The nickname has endured, but little else remains the same. Production has moved from Lahore to the coastal city of Karachi. The ban on Indian films was lifted, and it is these and Western offerings that keep Pakistan’s cinemas open today. But Pakistani films are, slowly, returning to the screen.

Shoaib Mansoor is the director credited with reversing the film industry’s fortunes, but his reputation is partly built on savvy marketing. In 2007 his film “Khuda Kay Liye” (“The Name of God”) was advertised as marking the official revival of Pakistani cinema. The move was a public relations masterstroke that took advantage of softening government control and tapped into a public hunger for local films.

“Khuda Kay Liye” follows the lives two young Pakistani men in the aftermath of 9/11. The film is darker than classic films, and the plot is sometimes convoluted. Yet Mr Mansoor found an audience eager for a modern Pakistani Urdu production and the film played to packed cinemas. Pakistani audiences had been promised a revival, and by showing up to cinemas across the country, they made it happen.

Mr Mansoor followed up with “Bol” (“Speak”) and 2017’s “Verna”. Both focus on gender issues, and the latter triggered a national debate. The plot of “Verna” follows a sexual assault survivor, a subject that caused enormous political controversy after Pakistan’s censor board took issue with what it called “edgy content”, and considered banning the film. The ensuing debate touched a public nerve, as it coincided with widespread protests held over the rape and murder of Zainab Ansari, a seven-year-old girl. When it was eventually screened, the film’s skewering of misogyny was applauded. Mr Mansoor typically focuses on content over style, choosing to pack his films with social criticism, sometimes to a fault. Both “Verna” and “Bol” were criticised for erratic pacing and weak cinematography.

But Mr Mansoor’s example has been followed and improved on by other directors. “Cake” (see picture), directed by Asim Abbasi, was released at the end of March. It’s a far cry from 1960s films, known for their melodrama and impressive song and dance numbers, yet is all the better for this. The plot revolves around the lives of two sisters caring for their ailing parents. One has remained in Pakistan and the other has just returned from Britain, a common scenario in Pakistan’s wealthier neighbourhoods (accordingly, critics have praised it for its realism). Mr Abbasi focuses on the conflicted relationship between the two women as they gather to celebrate their parents’ wedding anniversary, and neither muffles their anger nor exaggerates their rivalry. Refreshingly, their romantic ties remain secondary. “Cake” became the first Pakistani film to premiere at London’s Leicester Square.

Much work remains to be done. Pakistan’s Central Board of Film Censors continues to wield enormous power over which films are seen. And although the rising numbers of subversive films are encouraging, the social consequences of their release fall disproportionately on the women involved. The lead role in “Verna” was played by Mahira Khan, who has long been a target for sexist trolls online. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, an Oscar-winning documentary maker, has faced similar problems for her work on honour killings and acid attacks.

But despite the obstacles, a resurgence is finally underway in Lollywood. Fresh-faced directors such as Mr Abbasi have access to high production budgets, talented casts and scripts that avoid clichés. The new wave of Pakistani cinema may well eclipse its golden age.











ONE of the great riddles about the American economy is why its growth has slowed down so much during the past few decades. Between 1946 and 1975, America’s GDP per person grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% a year. On average, it has grown by just 1.8% a year since.

Many economists believe that national accounts may underestimate the economic significance of technological innovations. Despite the advent of the internet, smartphones and artificial intelligence, the official value added by the information industry as a share of GDP has scarcely changed since 2000. What might explain this paradox?

Part of the problem is that GDP as a measure only takes into account goods and services that people pay money for. Internet firms like Google and Facebook do not charge consumers for access, which means that national-income statistics will underestimate how much consumers have benefitted from their rise.

One way to quantify how much these internet services are worth is by asking people how much money they would have to be paid to forgo using them for a year. A new working paper by Erik Brynjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamaneni, three economists, does exactly this and finds that the value for consumers of some internet services can be substantial. Survey respondents said that they would have to be paid $3,600 to give up internet maps for a year, and $8,400 to give up e-mail. Search engines appear to be especially valuable: consumers surveyed said that they would have to be paid $17,500 to forgo their use for a year.A WAVE of automation anxiety has hit the West. Just try typing “Will machines…” into Google. An algorithm offers to complete the sentence with differing degrees of disquiet: “...take my job?”; “...take all jobs?”; “...replace humans?”; “...take over the world?”

Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction. In 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University used—what else?—a machine-learning algorithm to assess how easily 702 different kinds of job in America could be automated. They concluded that fully 47% could be done by machines “over the next decade or two”.













A new working paper by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, employs a similar approach, looking at other developed economies. Its technique differs from Mr Frey and Mr Osborne’s study by assessing the automatability of each task within a given job, based on a survey of skills in 2015. Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly vulnerable, defined as having at least a 70% chance of automation. A further 32% were slightly less imperilled, with a probability between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries in the study.

The pain will not be shared evenly. The study finds large variation across countries: jobs in Slovakia are twice as vulnerable as those in Norway. In general, workers in rich countries appear less at risk than those in middle-income ones. But wide gaps exist even between countries of similar wealth.

Differences in organisational structure and industry mix both play a role, but the former matters more. In South Korea, for example, 30% of jobs are in manufacturing, compared with 22% in Canada. Nonetheless, on average, Korean jobs are harder to automate than Canadian ones are. This may be because Korean employers have found better ways to combine, in the same job, and without reducing productivity, both routine tasks and social and creative ones, which computers or robots cannot do. A gloomier explanation would be “survivor bias”: the jobs that remain in Korea appear harder to automate only because Korean firms have already handed most of the easily automatable jobs to machines.AT SOME point, city-dwellers turned away from the sea. It’s hard to say when, exactly, but over the course of the last century, most urbanites stopped depending on the ocean for travel, for food, for work, for pleasure. Coastal residents have become more and more insulated from the water that surrounds them. “The water was a kind of embarrassing secret, the unloved daughter, neglected, while the parks were doted on, fussed over, overused,” muses the narrator of Teju Cole’s novel “Open City” (2011), about Manhattan, an island, one of America’s mythic ports of entry. This is true too in San Francisco, Boston, perhaps port cities everywhere: it is getting harder to sense the sea.

The sea feels largely absent from contemporary visual art, too. It is certainly absent compared to previous eras, when it was of source of fascination and inspiration for painters. The genre of marine painting exploded in the 17th-century Netherlands during the Dutch golden age, the peak of the empire’s naval power. But it is J.M.W. Turner’s Romantic marine paintings that are best known today. Turner, who painted in the late 1700s and 1800s, was obsessed with the sea. His seascapes teem with light and energy and suspended motion. He often painted shipwrecks, boats at the mercy of storms, nearly Biblical scenes of floods, men and women and children flailing in waves. He captured masterfully the sheer force, the awesomeness and the violence of the sea.

Art has traditionally dealt with the sea’s natural violence only. But a compelling body of newer work deals with questions of man’s violence, to the sea and at sea. These works are welcome returns to maritime art, and treat the sea as a political space rather than only a natural one.

Eve Mosher, an American artist, made “HighWaterLine” to directly confront urban blindness to the sea. The project began in 2007 in New York, but has spread to several other cities since. Ms Mosher drew a line in blue chalk through Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, ten feet (three metres) above sea level. Within the next century, scientists estimate that there could be flooding to that point as often as every four years. Large swaths of residential neighbourhoods were below her line, which she drew over the course of six months. Along the way, she was constantly explaining her mission to confused or intrigued or angry or inspired New Yorkers, who were forced to consider the possibility of the sea at their doorsteps.

Five years later, Hurricane Sandy struck New York. Water flooded up to and sometimes past where Ms Mosher’s line had been. “I didn’t set out to be a prophet(ess),” she wrote on her blog. “I never wanted it to happen.” In later incarnations, “HighWaterLine” has been collaborative: in Bristol in 2014, hundreds of people helped draw a 32-mile line.

A number of artists take a similarly literal approach to humans’ relationship with the sea, by working with found objects—found rubbish in particular. Done badly, trash-as-art feels moralising. But Mark Dion’s work is successful because he pays a deep attention to display. This is especially true of the American artist’s work modeled after Renaissance-era “cabinets of curiosities”. His 2014 piece “Cabinet of Marine Debris” features plastic detritus gathered during an expedition to islands off the coast of Alaska—bottle-caps, old moorings, detergent bottles—but carefully curated and arranged like collectors’ objects, giving them a strange beauty. It’s a challenge to the viewer: what are we looking at and why? Does this junk belong in a museum? Does it belong in the ocean? By asking us to consider the objects’ context, Mr Dion also asks the viewer to consider where the debris came from and why it was there in the first place.

Then there is “Vertigo Sea”, a video installation by John Akomfrah, a British artist who has made a breathtaking contemporary portrait of the oceans. It is showing at “Sublime Seas”, an exhibition which pairs it with Turner’s “The Deluge” (of the Biblical flood) at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Mr Akomfrah mixes archival film, BBC Natural History Unit footage, original filmed scenes and other video. Played across three screens, it feels like a constantly shifting collage. The sea is a rich source of life, a vast stage for human conflict throughout history, a mass graveyard and a space that is dying itself. The viewer is confronted with scenes of slaves in chains, packed together below deck; a polar bear shot to death; a whale sliced open for blubber, bleeding; icecaps melting; seaborne atom-bomb tests. We also see luminescent jellyfish floating to the surface, and surreal, still scenes that call to mind the paintings of Dalí and Magritte. We hear audio accounts of migrants’ deaths in the Mediterranean, and of women pushed from planes during the Chilean junta. We also hear snatches of poetry.

It is, in a sense, too much. Some scenes are hard to watch. But it’s also mesmerising, a complicated and powerful history of man, beast, and the sea. Like Turner, Mr Akomfrah, Mr Dion and Ms Mosher demand that we pay attention to the sea. But they insist that we look at it in a new way.

“Sublime Seas” is showing at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art until September 16th 2018, and "Vertigo Sea" will also show in New York's New Museum starting on June 20thAT THE end of last year Bytedance, one of China’s most talked-about technology firms, seemed to have the world at its feet. Since its founding in 2012 more than 700m users had tried out its apps, which serve people with a diet of news, funny videos and memes, tailored to individual users’ tastes by clever algorithms. The Beijing-based company had been valued at more than $20bn and embarked on a buying spree abroad in a bid to go global.

The picture now is less rosy. On April 9th state media reported that Chinese regulators had suspended Bytedance’s flagship app, Jinri Toutiao (Today’s Headlines) for three weeks. They had also banned outright another of its products, a joke-sharing app called Neihan Duanzi, which specialised in bawdy humour and had more than 20m active users. Officials said its “vulgar and banal” content had upset people. Two days later Zhang Yiming, the firm’s founder, issued an apology online saying he was “filled with guilt and remorse” that his apps had taken “the wrong path”. He said his company had not understood that “technology must be led by socialist core values.” He pledged that it would do more to spread “positive energy”.

Bytedance’s travails, and those of three other firms that also had to suspend their news-aggregating apps, suggest that censors are trying to catch up with new technology. Officials appear to worry that people can immerse themselves in news and entertainment which, while posing no direct challenge to the party, fail to promote party views. Personalised news services using artificial intelligence have enabled users to wall themselves off from puff pieces about the party’s latest achievements. (Jinri Toutiao’s slogan, featured in the advertisement pictured above, promises readers “only what you care about”.) David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says that “party leaders are aware of this.” This is why Mr Zhang now promises to do a better job of promoting “authoritative media” through his services.

Censors are also paying more attention to content they regard as “lowbrow”: material deemed licentious, sexist or likely to encourage what the party regards as immoral behaviour. State media have reported disapprovingly on the uploading of videos to one of Bytedance’s platforms by teenage mothers who do not appear contrite about having children before the legal age for marriage. Cultural commissars are becoming quicker to suppress anything they regard as non-mainstream, from hip-hop music to tattoos. The national football team recently took to the field with their ink hidden under bandages.

In the past ten months officials have also been clamping down on gossip. Some portals have replaced their feeds offering news about celebrities with alternatives directing users to patriotic fare. Regulators have also shut down the microblog accounts of celebrity-gossip writers. The censors’ reasoning may be that tattle about film stars might lead people to believe that it is also acceptable to peddle rumour about politicians. Or they may have simply decided that reading such news diverts people’s attention from the latest utterances of President Xi Jinping.

Xi’s amazing

Efforts to boost Mr Xi are reaching unprecedented heights. Pictures of him are commanding increasing amounts of space on the front pages of official newspapers. Last month a film called “Amazing China” became the country’s highest-ever grossing documentary, in large part because government offices and state-linked companies have been encouraged to block-book screenings for their staff. The film dwells on the achievements of Mr Xi. In February the media regulator said that it would designate 5,000 cinemas as “People’s Theatres”. These will have to devote more time to films such as “Amazing China” that promote socialist values.

The censors’ shifting priorities are a challenge for Chinese tech firms. Companies that operate social-media platforms or allow users to share content have their own in-house censors. In his online apology, Mr Zhang of Bytedance said he planned to expand his team of them by two-thirds, to 10,000. But such employees are often unsure how to interpret the government’s directives. Last year the New York Times reported that regulators had circulated a less-than-helpful list of 68 types of material that internet firms were expected to expunge, ranging from media that promote “unhealthy marital values” to posts that blur lines between “beauty and ugliness”.

Satisfying the censors also involves financial risk. Bytedance and similar companies will find it much more difficult to attract and retain users without content that is “borderline risqué”, says Bhavtosh Vajpayee of Bernstein, a research firm. Officials’ distaste for news packaged by algorithm could impede China’s development of artificial intelligence, since news aggregators such as Toutiao offer a profitable means of improving such technology.

Above all, the party itself is taking a risk. In the decade or two before Mr Xi took over, people were given wider leeway to amuse themselves as they wished as long as they avoided politics. Officials may have reckoned that such an approach would reinforce stability by giving people less reason to resent the party. Mr Xi, by contrast, is trying to revive the party as an enforcer of morality and taste. By stamping on citizens’ small pleasures he could irritate many people who had previously shown no interest in politics.

The biggest fans of Bytedance’s now-defunct humour app, for example, were men without great prospects living in smaller cities. That the app helped them form groups of like-minded individuals in the real world and engage in pranks such as honking their car horns in a coded sequence may help explain why the authorities shut it down. But by trying to insert more propaganda into such people’s leisure time, officials could end up making the party seem like a bore who doesn’t know when to shut up.

In recent weeks, among the country’s more than 700m internet users, there has been evidence of unhappiness with the party’s meddling. On April 13th Sina Weibo, one of the country’s biggest social-media platforms, declared a three-month effort to purge itself of posts containing pornography or promoting violence or homosexuality—topics that had been ruled off-limits by the regulator. It is possible that Sina decided to mount its campaign in a highly public manner in order to show off its zeal to the party’s media watchdogs.

Angry people flooded the site with messages lambasting the firm’s intolerance of homosexuality. Even the People’s Daily, a party mouthpiece, weighed in against Sina. On April 16th the company said it would no longer target gay content that was not smutty. The incident marked a rare victory for online freedom and for gay rights. It was also a reminder of how contentious and how unpredictable China’s expanding censorship has become.AS IN most countries, only adults are allowed to buy pornography in British shops. In theory, the same is true online. In practice, of course, obtaining pornography on the internet is easy at any age. Prodded by children’s charities, the government wants to tighten things up. The Digital Economy Act, which was passed in 2017, included a requirement that pornographic websites would have to check their users’ age before allowing them access. The rules were due to come into force this month. But in March, buried at the bottom of an unrelated press release, the government pushed the date back to the end of the year.

Quietly postponing a policy is often the first step towards abandoning it. But not, it seems, in this case. The government has appointed the British Board of Film Classification, the country’s film censor, to enforce the new rules on age-verification. The BBFC is now consulting the public on how it should go about that job, with a view to presenting its ideas to Parliament in the summer.

The general idea is not new. Like many other countries, Britain already imposes age checks on gambling websites, which ask their users for details such as their names and addresses, which can be checked against public records such as the electoral roll. But that could be a problem with porn. One of the advantages of internet pornography is that it avoids the embarrassment involved in buying a magazine in a shop. Customers may be reluctant to hand over identifying details that could leak—or be hacked—in future.

David Austin, the BBFC’s boss, is at pains to point out that porn remains legal, and that the law is not intended to make life harder for the 56% of British adults who admitted in a survey in 2014 that they had watched online porn at least “occasionally”. Rather than run the age-checking schemes itself, the BBFC will oversee their development by other organisations. But, says Mr Austin, there are many ways that such checks might be done. One would be to require users to enter a credit-card number, or provide details of a mobile-phone contract, both of which can be obtained only by adults. Another idea, for the more privacy-conscious, is to allow people to buy, in physical shops, a numerical code that would provide access to the forbidden fruit online. Such numbers could be sold in the same way as alcohol and cigarettes, with identification requested only if the shopkeeper thinks a customer looks suspiciously young.

The BBFC will have the power to require internet service providers to block access to sites that flout the rules, as well as to levy fines and to require payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard to cut off the site’s source of income.

The government says the law is designed to protect children who stumble across porn while looking for other things. But for those depraved teenagers seeking out the stuff deliberately, things seem unlikely to get much more difficult. Attempts in Britain to block piracy websites have proved easy to circumvent, via virtual private networks (which hide what is passing through an internet connection) and proxy sites (which disguise a user’s eventual destination). Porn sites will be no different. A schoolyard black market in login IDs seems inevitable. The law is designed to target commercial porn providers. But plenty of porn is available through search engines and social media, even though it is not their main business.

Ironically, the new law could prove a boon for a Luxembourg-based firm called MindGeek, which is reckoned to be the world’s biggest porn merchant. The firm is one of the biggest bandwidth-users, servicing more than 100m visitors a day across its various websites, among which is Pornhub, the most popular porn site. It has an age-verification product of its own, called AgeID, which is in use in Germany (which already requires age-verification for porn). Assuming it gets the nod from the BBFC, MindGeek is ready to deploy the system for British users.

Other porn sites would be able use AgeID to comply with the new laws, for a fee. Many of MindGeek’s rivals resent the prospect of paying an already-dominant firm. But MindGeek’s market power could make AgeID the most-used piece of age-verification software across the web—and not just in the porn industry. Video-streaming sites, from YouTube to the BBC, offer violent, sweary content that, like porn, is supposed to be off-limits to children. It is an interesting question, says Mr Austin, to ponder whether age-verification rules might one day apply to them, too.EVEN the Minahasan people, who pride themselves on eating bushmeat, call the collection of stalls at Tomohon, in the highlands of North Sulawesi, the “extreme market”. There is certainly something extreme about the serried carcasses, blackened by blow torches to burn off the fur, the faces charred in a rictus grin. The sheer range of species on the slabs is also astonishing: reticulated pythons, warty pigs, flying foxes (a type of fruit bat) and the Sulawesi giant rat (no, it doesn’t taste like chicken). Especially as Christmas and Easter approach, other specimens find their way to the market, including crested macaques and a tree-dwelling marsupial, the adorable Sulawesi bear cuscus.

The pasar extrim speaks to Sulawesi’s striking biogeography. The Indonesian island straddles the boundary between Asiatic and Australian species—and boasts an extraordinary number of species found nowhere else. But the market also symbolises how Asia’s amazing biodiversity is under threat. Most of the species on sale in Tomohon have seen populations crash because of overhunting (habitat destruction has played a part too). Fewer than 6,000 crested macaques now inhabit the forests. The cuscus hangs on by its fingertips—or its curling, prehensile tail.

The appetites of the locals are not the only worry. An hour’s drive from Tomohon is Bitung, terminus for ferry traffic from the Moluccan archipelago and Papua, Indonesia’s easternmost province. These regions are even richer in wildlife, especially birds. Trade in wild birds is supposedly circumscribed. Yet the ferries are crammed with them: Indonesian soldiers returning from a tour in Papua typically pack a few wild cockatoos or lories to sell. One in five urban households in Indonesia keeps birds. Bitung feeds Java’s huge bird markets. The port is also a shipment point on a bird-smuggling route to the Philippines and then to China, Taiwan, even Europe. Crooked officials enable the racket.

The trade in animal parts used for traditional medicine or to denote high status, especially in China and Vietnam, is an even bigger racket. Many believe ground rhino horn to be effective against fever, as well as to make you, well, horny. Javan and Sumatran rhinos were not long ago widespread across South-East Asia, but poaching has confined them to a few tiny pockets of the islands after which they are named. Numbers of the South Asian rhinoceros are healthier, yet poachers in Kaziranga national park in north-east India have killed 74 in the past three years alone.

Name your charismatic species and measure decline. Between 2010 and 2017 over 2,700 of the ivory helmets of the helmeted hornbill, a striking bird from South-East Asia, were seized, with Hong Kong a notorious transshipment hub. It is critically endangered. As for the tiger, in China and Vietnam its bones and penis feature in traditional medicine, while tiger fangs and claws are emblems of status and power. Fewer than 4,000 tigers survive in the wild. The pressure from poachers is severe, especially in India. The parts of over 1,700 tigers have been seized since 2000.

The brutal economics of extinction leads to two conclusions. Those holding valuable stocks of a particular creature have little interest in saving it in the wild. And it pays to generate new demand and supply. Both conclusions favour well-organised international criminal syndicates.

Asia’s wildlife mafias have gone global. Owing to Asian demand for horns, the number of rhinos poached in South Africa leapt from 13 in 2007 to 1,028 last year. The new frontline is South America. A jaguar’s four fangs, ten claws, pelt and genitalia sell for $20,000 in Asia. Between 2013 and 2016 authorities in Bolivia seized 380 jaguar fangs.

South Africa auctions permits to hunt a few rhinos each year, with the proceeds supposed to fund conservation. This has provided cover for poachers. One Thai smuggler used prostitutes to pose as legal trophy hunters; the dead beasts’ horns ended up in Asia. Schemes to farm animals, which some said would undercut incentives to poach, have proved equally harmful. Lion parts from South African farms are sold in Asia as a cheaper substitute for tiger, or passed off as tiger—either way, stimulating demand. The farming of tigers in China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam provides cover for the trafficking of wild tiger parts. Meanwhile, wild animals retain their cachet—consumers of rhino horn believe the wild rhino grazes only on medicinal plants.

From eco-warriors to eco-detectives

The anti-trafficking regime laid out under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or CITES, struggles to keep up. But change is in the air. Wildlife NGOs are hiring ex-cops as sleuths and working with governments to provide intelligence on trafficking networks. In Indonesia the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), an American NGO, helps bring half of all cases of wildlife crime to court. Of those cases, says Dwi Adhiasto of the WCS, nine-tenths end in convictions, compared with just half when it is not involved.

The arrest in Thailand in January of Boonchai Bach, head of one of Asia’s biggest wildlife-trafficking networks, was cause for cheer. But many weak links remain, not least corruption and poor enforcement in Cambodia and Laos, the preferred smuggling routes into China and Vietnam. Scott Roberton of WCS in Vietnam says governments are getting more serious about wildlife crime, with China taking the lead. But authorities in different countries do not collaborate enough against the traffickers.

Curbing demand may prove even harder. Consuming rhino horn has no more medicinal value than chewing your nails. Yet demand for rhino leapt in Vietnam on rumours that a government minister had been cured of cancer by it. Some younger, more affluent Asians are growing interested in eating wild meat. Back in Sulawesi, some conservationists want Minahasan pastors to thunder from the pulpit against bushmeat—even though their bellies might argue otherwise.Companies increasingly want their leaders to have coaching skills. Professor Julia Milner (pictured), Director of the Global MBA at EDHEC Business School, explains what business schools can do to address this

WHEN MBA graduates finish their degrees, we want them to have a variety of capabilities. One of the main ones is “leadership skills”. Yet the eternal question remains: which leadership skills should we focus on?

The first step, as in any business case, is to explore industry demands. There is already a break from the past in what organisations want from their leaders. In a companywide internal review at Google in 2013 to establish what made an effective manager, “being a good coach” came top of a long list—trumping technical expertise. The millennial generation, who already constitute the largest segment of the workforce, crave coaching by their managers.

New developments in the world of work require new leadership approaches. Leading no longer happens solely face-to-face: technology allows individuals and teams to work remotely and on-demand. Workers join and leave projects more frequently, so employees must act more as entrepreneurs. The manager’s skillset must allow people to experiment, to find their own answers and to learn from their mistakes. A traditional “command and control” approach in which people are told what to do and are micromanaged won’t work. Managers might miss out on great ideas because they are telling their staff what to do. By contrast, a coaching approach enables the employee to come up with their own ideas and enables their intrinsic motivations. Research shows that when leaders use coaching it improves employee’s motivation levels and performance, and boosts satisfaction with both their job and manager.

Coaching skills may be more in demand, but they are in short supply. In a 2017 Financial Times survey that asked what skills employers are looking for in MBA graduates, coaching was listed as being one of the most difficult to recruit. This issue is a regular occurrence in my consulting work. Understanding what coaching is can be a challenge. I have seen executives tell managers to “Just Coach”, without providing the necessary training. Some leaders think of someone yelling instructions from the sidelines but that is simply solving an issue for their team member. Instead I help managers to develop their listening skills and how to ask the right questions: what are your own observations; what is working; what is not working and what alternatives are yet to be explored?

Business schools therefore need to teach how leaders become good coaches. In the Global MBA course I teach, my starting point is to cover basic coaching techniques such as:

• appropriate questioning instead of prescribing solutions

• constructive feedback

• assisting with goal setting

• effective listening skills

• identifying and working with employee strengths

• alignment of individual & organisational values

• perspective, ie, understanding the challenges. It takes longer initially to manage in this way, but it is quicker in the long run because teams are more able to manage themselves. Managers can then focus on more strategic issues instead of getting lost in dealing with day-to-day issues.

One of the most important points in learning coaching is a focus on receiving feedback and reflection. Managers may think they are asking a question, when they are simply disguising an instruction: “don’t you think it is a good idea to go with option A?”. By contrast, open questions such as “What do you see as a way forward?”, allow a team member to come up with their own answer. It is also important to encourage feedback on one’s own coaching skills and take the time to reflect on this.

The good news is that leaders can learn coaching skills. The bad news is that in most cases they have to be taught them. In a recent study I co-authored, we found that out of 580 human resource and general managers at Australian companies, 40% said they wanted initial or more training in coaching skills. Organisations should not expect to employ natural coaches and managers are demanding training in coaching. Google now makes good coaching practices part of its leaders’ evaluation system and training portfolio. Business schools need to arm their MBAs with these skills, and organisations should further this training and incorporate coaching into their culture.

Professor Julia Milner teaches an MBA core subject on ‘Managing Human Capital with Coaching’. Training leaders in coaching skills, she co-developed the LEADER model, which caters to the unique situation of leaders as coaches. She has just been named among the world’s top 40 business school professors under the age of 40 by Poets & Quants.Try GRE Tutor for 7 days with no commitment

Women face a unique set of challenges when progressing into senior leadership positions, including unconscious bias, a scarcity of role models, and a peer group that continually shrinks the more senior they become. These can make striving for the top a lonely and frustrating endeavour even in organisations with the best intentions to support their top female talent.

Women executives rarely have an opportunity to come together and share their leadership experiences in a learning environment that has direct relevance and personal impact. INSEAD’s Women Leaders Programme is designed to create just this environment. It addresses leadership issues that affect all executives, in a forum that hones in on the unique challenges women encounter. It creates a network of today’s senior women leaders, empowering them to take hold of their careers and aim for the top.A WAVE of automation anxiety has hit the West. Just try typing “Will machines…” into Google. An algorithm offers to complete the sentence with differing degrees of disquiet: “...take my job?”; “...take all jobs?”; “...replace humans?”; “...take over the world?”

Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction. In 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University used—what else?—a machine-learning algorithm to assess how easily 702 different kinds of job in America could be automated. They concluded that fully 47% could be done by machines “over the next decade or two”.













A new working paper by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, employs a similar approach, looking at other developed economies. Its technique differs from Mr Frey and Mr Osborne’s study by assessing the automatability of each task within a given job, based on a survey of skills in 2015. Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly vulnerable, defined as having at least a 70% chance of automation. A further 32% were slightly less imperilled, with a probability between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries in the study.

The pain will not be shared evenly. The study finds large variation across countries: jobs in Slovakia are twice as vulnerable as those in Norway. In general, workers in rich countries appear less at risk than those in middle-income ones. But wide gaps exist even between countries of similar wealth.

Differences in organisational structure and industry mix both play a role, but the former matters more. In South Korea, for example, 30% of jobs are in manufacturing, compared with 22% in Canada. Nonetheless, on average, Korean jobs are harder to automate than Canadian ones are. This may be because Korean employers have found better ways to combine, in the same job, and without reducing productivity, both routine tasks and social and creative ones, which computers or robots cannot do. A gloomier explanation would be “survivor bias”: the jobs that remain in Korea appear harder to automate only because Korean firms have already handed most of the easily automatable jobs to machines.AT SOME point, city-dwellers turned away from the sea. It’s hard to say when, exactly, but over the course of the last century, most urbanites stopped depending on the ocean for travel, for food, for work, for pleasure. Coastal residents have become more and more insulated from the water that surrounds them. “The water was a kind of embarrassing secret, the unloved daughter, neglected, while the parks were doted on, fussed over, overused,” muses the narrator of Teju Cole’s novel “Open City” (2011), about Manhattan, an island, one of America’s mythic ports of entry. This is true too in San Francisco, Boston, perhaps port cities everywhere: it is getting harder to sense the sea.

The sea feels largely absent from contemporary visual art, too. It is certainly absent compared to previous eras, when it was of source of fascination and inspiration for painters. The genre of marine painting exploded in the 17th-century Netherlands during the Dutch golden age, the peak of the empire’s naval power. But it is J.M.W. Turner’s Romantic marine paintings that are best known today. Turner, who painted in the late 1700s and 1800s, was obsessed with the sea. His seascapes teem with light and energy and suspended motion. He often painted shipwrecks, boats at the mercy of storms, nearly Biblical scenes of floods, men and women and children flailing in waves. He captured masterfully the sheer force, the awesomeness and the violence of the sea.

Art has traditionally dealt with the sea’s natural violence only. But a compelling body of newer work deals with questions of man’s violence, to the sea and at sea. These works are welcome returns to maritime art, and treat the sea as a political space rather than only a natural one.

Eve Mosher, an American artist, made “HighWaterLine” to directly confront urban blindness to the sea. The project began in 2007 in New York, but has spread to several other cities since. Ms Mosher drew a line in blue chalk through Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, ten feet (three metres) above sea level. Within the next century, scientists estimate that there could be flooding to that point as often as every four years. Large swaths of residential neighbourhoods were below her line, which she drew over the course of six months. Along the way, she was constantly explaining her mission to confused or intrigued or angry or inspired New Yorkers, who were forced to consider the possibility of the sea at their doorsteps.

Five years later, Hurricane Sandy struck New York. Water flooded up to and sometimes past where Ms Mosher’s line had been. “I didn’t set out to be a prophet(ess),” she wrote on her blog. “I never wanted it to happen.” In later incarnations, “HighWaterLine” has been collaborative: in Bristol in 2014, hundreds of people helped draw a 32-mile line.

A number of artists take a similarly literal approach to humans’ relationship with the sea, by working with found objects—found rubbish in particular. Done badly, trash-as-art feels moralising. But Mark Dion’s work is successful because he pays a deep attention to display. This is especially true of the American artist’s work modeled after Renaissance-era “cabinets of curiosities”. His 2014 piece “Cabinet of Marine Debris” features plastic detritus gathered during an expedition to islands off the coast of Alaska—bottle-caps, old moorings, detergent bottles—but carefully curated and arranged like collectors’ objects, giving them a strange beauty. It’s a challenge to the viewer: what are we looking at and why? Does this junk belong in a museum? Does it belong in the ocean? By asking us to consider the objects’ context, Mr Dion also asks the viewer to consider where the debris came from and why it was there in the first place.

Then there is “Vertigo Sea”, a video installation by John Akomfrah, a British artist who has made a breathtaking contemporary portrait of the oceans. It is showing at “Sublime Seas”, an exhibition which pairs it with Turner’s “The Deluge” (of the Biblical flood) at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Mr Akomfrah mixes archival film, BBC Natural History Unit footage, original filmed scenes and other video. Played across three screens, it feels like a constantly shifting collage. The sea is a rich source of life, a vast stage for human conflict throughout history, a mass graveyard and a space that is dying itself. The viewer is confronted with scenes of slaves in chains, packed together below deck; a polar bear shot to death; a whale sliced open for blubber, bleeding; icecaps melting; seaborne atom-bomb tests. We also see luminescent jellyfish floating to the surface, and surreal, still scenes that call to mind the paintings of Dalí and Magritte. We hear audio accounts of migrants’ deaths in the Mediterranean, and of women pushed from planes during the Chilean junta. We also hear snatches of poetry.

It is, in a sense, too much. Some scenes are hard to watch. But it’s also mesmerising, a complicated and powerful history of man, beast, and the sea. Like Turner, Mr Akomfrah, Mr Dion and Ms Mosher demand that we pay attention to the sea. But they insist that we look at it in a new way.

“Sublime Seas” is showing at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art until September 16th 2018, and "Vertigo Sea" will also show in New York's New Museum starting on June 20thAS IN most countries, only adults are allowed to buy pornography in British shops.

Apparently, leaders are contacting workers after hours. But should they?

The legal factor

Before addressing such issues as work/life balance, perhaps the most important question is whether employers have the legal right to contact employees when they’re not at work.

According to Dallas attorney Todd Shadle, chair of the employment law section of Godwin Bowman & Martinez PC, while most companies have policies regarding non-exempt employees and overtime, after-hours and remote access work is not addressed.

In fact, according to the Challenger, Gray & Christmas survey, less than 10% of surveyed companies have a policy that details communicating for work outside of work hours. Another 3% stated they were working on a policy, but the majority (87.5%) have no procedures in place.

“It becomes a problem when the manager is demanding information immediately—which happens in small businesses as well as major corporations,” Shadle says.

He explains that employees don’t have the luxury of ignoring requests and often feel compelled to respond, so companies need to establish policies that address these issues.

However, he admits that currently, it’s not clear if answering a few voicemail or email messages qualifies as compensable work.

“Regarding exempt employees, there are no restrictions on what an employer can expect,” he says.

That’s because exempt employees operate by a totally different set of rules.

Charles Krugel, an employment lawyer and HR counselor in Chicago, explains, “With employees who are properly classified as salaried employees, the off-the-clock question doesn't apply since salaried employees aren't paid by the hour but on a flat rate.”

As a result, he says the question of whether it is legal to contact an employee after hours or not would depend on whether the employee is salaried or paid by the hour.

“In any event, I strongly advise companies that if they require off-the-clock work, then document all of those hours,” Krugel says.

Beyond that, Shadle believes there is no right or wrong answer if the company is prepared to pay its hourly-compensated employees.

“It's not a matter of ‘should,’ but whether it's cost-feasible for a company to require off-the clock contact with hourly employees,” he says.

The work/life balance factor

After clearing the legal hurdle, it has been established that U.S. companies have the right to contact exempt employees, and pay non-exempt workers (or try to claim that the contact doesn’t constitute a significant time requirement).

But should companies contact employees outside of work hours?

Jason Fried, CEO of Basecamp, doesn’t think so.

“No, it's not company time, it's life time,” he says. Fried believes 40 hours a week should be plenty of time to accomplish everything that needs to get done. If companies can contact workers at will, Fried believes employees never really get to “leave” work.

He admits that there may be emergencies and special situations that require contacting employees, but stresses that these incidents should be real emergencies.

“It’s reasonable to have one or two emergencies a year—but, if it's more frequent than that, you've got deeper problems on your hands,” Fried says.

Adam Beeson, director of communications at G2, believes that there are several factors that determine if companies should contact an employee outside of normal work hours.

“Your business, industry and the function an employee serves for the company would be deciding factors,” he says. For example, in the healthcare industry, a specially-skilled employee might have information that could help a patient.

“However,” he stresses, “in an industry where the work is not a matter of life and death, the questions should be approached differently.”

Many employees have an expectation of after-hours contact. A Gallup poll reveals that 60% of U.S. workers check email outside of business hours.

Elizabeth Cogswell Baskin, CEO and executive creative director of Tribe, Inc., says this issue reflects the company’s culture.

“For some cultures, being available 24/7 is almost a point of pride for employees; for others, employees will find such expectations an affront to their rights to a personal life,” she says.

Baskin believes the tone is set at the top. If the CEO works nights and weekends, there may be an expectation that everyone else will follow suit and communicate around the clock.

“In a company where employees expect to leave their work at the office, managers need to respect that—or have frank discussions with their team about why they sometimes will need to be available after hours.”

The distracted driving factor

Findings from a Harris Poll reveal that 27% of employees say their boss has called/texted them while knowing that they were driving.

“People typically want to please their managers and employers, but doing so [while driving] could come at a big price,” says Joan Woodward, president of the Travelers Institute and executive vice president of Public Policy at Travelers.

Woodward warns that when employees take their eyes off the road, even for a few seconds, the results could be catastrophic.

“It’s important for supervisors to lead by example and make it clear they don’t expect an immediate response while an employee may be driving, whether it be a phone call, email, or text.”

Establishing criteria

If employees need to be contacted when they’re not at work, this should entail guidelines—and, perhaps, a reverse pecking order.

For example, Beeson believes that employees in leadership should be contacted before reaching out to a lower level employee.

“In many instances, the more advanced leader is better prepared to handle the question remotely than the less experienced, lower-level employee,” he explains.

And if the issue at hand can’t be handled remotely, he doesn’t see the point in contacting them.

Fried believes the only criterion to consider should be respect.

“Companies don't own people—they pay people for a full day's work, not a whole day's work.”

He says that 8-9 hours is more than enough time for a workday and anything more than that is “an invasion of life.”

Fried says respect must start at the top, with owners and managers treating their workers as human beings and not cogs in a machine.

“People aren't on-demand like a Netflix show, they are at work or they aren't.”

At the Rotman School of Management, we combine the core principles of design with the Playing to Win strategy framework developed by Roger Martin—recently named the world's most influential management thinker.

Winning in the marketplace means consistently offering your customers compelling products, seamless interactions, and experiences that delight and inspire. To do this, you’ll need to develop superior innovation practices.

Our applied three-day Design Thinking program gives you both Rotman’s signature Design Thinking approach and the Playing to Win framework used by Fortune 500 companies world-wide.In an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous Asian business environment, yesterday's answers are often swept away by disruptive innovation, local or multinational competition. Furthermore, executives often are unaware or underestimate the differences in the way business is conducted between cultures. How then do executives with multiple-country or regional responsibilities successfully lead and drive their organisation’s growth?

"Winning Business Performance in Asia" will provide a context to understand how businesses can flourish in the competitive Asian region with sessions on strategy, cross-cultural leadership and methods to drive and manage international growth. All sessions are supported with examples and case studies for increased learning through discussion with facilitators as well as among participants.

Asia, a thriving hub of opportunities, also presents vast challenges in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. Its labyrinth of cultural mores and values add further complexities. Executives tasked to lead businesses or drive growth across multiple countries are required to work across cultures, against both established and new competitors for customers with rapidly changing behaviours.

Today’s and tomorrow’s executives and business leaders are struggling with growth despite the enormous potential locked within Asia. We identify how business leaders can conceptualize and activate a winning business performance across multiple territories in Asia by focusing both on theory and practice. We also consider having developed a growth strategy within a home market, how executives can empower organisations and teams to expand and succeed in Asia.

During this intensive three-day programme you will learn both the theory behind proven business performance models and approaches through current Asian business case studies led by recognised SMU Professors. Additionally, through SMU’s interactive pedagogy, and small and large group discussions, led by a leading business practitioner with 30 years of Asia experience, we will help you discover the skills of applying these best practices in Asian business situations to build practical skills.

By the course’s end you will possess key frameworks, the latest insights, and numerous case examples of developing successful business practices for Asia; both how they have gone wrong, and more importantly how to get them right for the future.Mark E.

However, knowing how to use, implement and leverage data-driven sources can be daunting at best. Staying ahead of the market and gauging changes in customer behavior are all critical aspects of developing a competitive strategy. In a recent Gartner report, 60% of data projects fail due to a variety of factors tied to data quality issues (Gartner Inc., 2015).

As a leader, your ability to create capacity for innovation across the organization relies heavily on getting the right data, interpreting the results, and making the right decisions.
