A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld a lower court’s decision to issue a national injunction against the Trump administration’s efforts to deny federal funding to sanctuary cities.

The three-judge panel sided with the city of Chicago, which sued the Trump administration last year after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DOJ would deny certain publicly safety grants to law enforcement agencies in cities that limited their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The city’s lawyers had argued that Sessions exceeded his authority when he placed conditions on the grants beyond what Congress had outlined when it set up the programs. The judges agreed, ruling to uphold the injunction while Chicago’s lawsuit winds its way through the federal courts.

“The Attorney General in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement,” Judge Ilana Rovner on behalf of the court. “But the power of the purse rests with Congress[.]”

In a strong rebuke to the administration, Rovner added that allowing federal agencies to manipulate conditions for grant funding without congressional approval could lead to “tyranny.”

The legal bout is but one of many between the administration and cities and states challenging its immigration policies.

Since Donald Trump and Ted Cruz first faced off in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016, the president has repeatedly and sometimes viciously attacked the Texas senator. He accused Cruz’s father of assisting in the assassination of JFK, cruelly mocked Cruz’s wife, and, as is the president’s habit, gave Cruz a derogatory nickname, “Lyin’ Ted.”

Cruz, in turn, has not held back in his criticisms of Trump. He’s called him a “narcissist,” “utterly amoral,” and a “pathological liar.” And after dropping out of the the primary, he famously refused to endorse Trump, even during his speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention. From the convention stage, he asked the crowd to “vote your conscience.”

But that all must be water under the bridge, right? On Thursday Time published its list of the 100 most influential people, and, it turns out, Trump’s one-time foe actually penned the blurb about the president’s inestimable power and influence. Cruz calls Trump “a flash-bang grenade thrown into Washington by the forgotten men and women of America.” He continues, “The fact that his first year as Commander in Chief disoriented and distressed members of the media and political establishment is not a bug but a feature.”

Twitter had a field day with Cruz’s effusive praise:

For the first time in more than half a century, Cuba will not be led by a Castro. On Thursday, Raúl Castro stepped down as the president of the communist nation, a position he’d inherited from his brother Fidel in 2008. His presidency was marked by significant changes for the island, including opening up a small but crucial private sector and renewing diplomatic relations with the United States.

Fidel Castro died in November 2016. Raúl, who turns 87 in June, is expected to hold onto his powerful position as head of the Communist Party of Cuba. On Thursday, Cuba’s National Assembly selected his successor, 57-year-old First Vice President Miguel Díaz-Canel, whom Castro reportedly has been grooming for this position for years.

So what’s next for a country that has only known one-party family rule since the Cuban Revolution of 1959? We spoke with Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive’s Cuba Documentation Project, and coauthor of a 2015 Mother Jones article on Cuba’s back-channel negotiations with former President Barack Obama. Kornbluh discussed how history will remember Raúl Castro, the status of Trump-Cuba relations, and what we know about Cuba’s new president.

Mother Jones: What will be Raúl Castro’s legacy as president of Cuba?

PK: For 10 years, he has been the undisputed leader of Cuba. His legacy is going to be built around several very important initiatives that he undertook that his brother really never did. He attempted to somewhat lessen state control of the daily lives of Cubans. You can see that in his decision to legalize the use of cellphones, legalize the private sale of cars and homes. Under Fidel there was this onerous paperwork and authorization you had to get if you wanted to leave the country. Raúl basically said people should be free to go and come back, or go and not come back and send remittances.

He really made the move to try and build a private sector in Cuba. Cuban economists have been saying for almost 30 years that the state simply cannot afford to have everybody on its payroll. Fidel had accepted it under great pressure after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but Raúl really opened up the private sector. In the short time that he has been president, the private sector has gone from being minuscule to including over half a million people, probably closer to a million Cubans called cuentapropistas, self-employed entrepreneurs, working in very small businesses.

Part of Raúl’s legacy is he didn’t really go far enough with this, that there have been fits and starts. Hardliners have put pressure to halt the growth of the private sector because it portends an inequality in society. Those who are in the private sector making money, particularly in the tourism sector, are becoming the haves, and the vast majority of Cubans in the state sector are essentially the have-nots.

The third element of his legacy is perhaps one of the most extraordinary. He agreed to normalize relations with the United States of America. In the end, history will record that it was Raúl who made the agreement with Barack Obama and opened the door to the situation that we have today, and not his brother Fidel.

“If Trump will stop trying to channel his inner Theodore Roosevelt, I think there could be a real opening here.”

MJ: What power will Castro exert from afar?

PK: Even though the mainstream press is saying this is the end of the Castro era, in fact, Raúl Castro retains two arguably more powerful positions than the presidency: first secretary of the Communist Party and, at least for now, head of the Cuban armed forces. He also has a son, Alejandro, who is very high in the Cuban intelligence community, though it’s somewhat murky what is happening with him right now.

Those positions are important for Raúl to have the back of the new president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, who, make no mistake, really is the person who Raúl feels has the capability to lead Cuba forward with a mix of modernization and respect for the principles of the Cuban revolution.

MJ: What do we know about the new president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel?

PK: Miguel Díaz-Canel has risen through the ranks of the Cuban Communist Party to the highest point of leadership. He is significantly younger than the leadership generation that is retiring with Raúl. He rose to be a provincial leader in the Communist Party. He is known to be a listener. He is known not to be an elitist.

He became education minister in 2009 until 2013, when he was moved to be first vice president. It’s hard to know what his real positions are. On the one hand, he has been caught on tape trying to bolster the hardline side of the Communist Party by railing against more independent websites and news outlets. On the other hand, he is somebody that thought the internet should be expanded significantly in Cuba. I think what’s most significant is that his position on the United States is relatively unknown. He is going to become president in the midst of a tonal attack by the Trump administration.

MJ: Where do US-Cuban relations currently stand under the Trump Administration?

PK: Cubans and the United States still have to work out what happened with the health problems of US and Canadian personnel in Cuba. [Diplomats experienced mysterious brain injuries in 2016.] They have to work this out, even if it takes Cuban intelligence and CIA officials sitting down very quietly together to discuss what technologies they might be using against one another. We have a travel advisory in place that is hurting US travel to Cuba. That travel advisory is not going to go away until they resolve what happened.

“Cubans are looking for a significant improvement in their daily existence, which frankly is a struggle.”

The Trump administration has completely changed from the daylight of the Obama era and a tone of respect and civil dialogue and negotiations with the Cubans, to the darkness of regime-change rhetoric, abusive insults, and being a bully from the bully pulpit. That said, the policy that Obama and Cuba and Raúl arrived at has not significantly changed. US businesses can still work in Cuba under certain restrictions. We still have various teams of diplomats that meet somewhat regularly. We just had more plane routes approved, more cruise ships approved. It’s not as if relations are being broken, even if the sounds from Washington have gone from being respectful to being abusive and malicious. Hopefully, on the Cuban side, they understand this is part of the theater of the Trump era and they focus on the substance of our relations.

It would be to the benefit of all that the Trump administration understands that this is a transitional point in Cuba. The best way to take advantage of that is to work toward civil and more normal relations. Trump seems to have no problem having relations with other strongmen around the world. If Trump will stop trying to channel his inner Theodore Roosevelt, as a kind of bully from the imperial Colossus of the North, I think there could be a real opening here.

MJ: What are Cubans hoping to see from their new president?

PK: Cubans are looking for a significant improvement in their daily existence, which frankly is a struggle. It’s a struggle because there are shortages. It’s a struggle because of the bureaucracy. It’s a struggle because they don’t get paid enough to make ends meet. It’s a struggle because even those in the private sector are being cast in a negative light by the party when in fact they are the ones helping to move Cuba into the modern world. They are the ones in the end who are going to provide a tax base to pay for the substance of the revolution, the health care, the education, the things that the state has done so well for people in the past but can’t afford to do now unless there are significant changes.

Educated Cubans don’t see a future for themselves, and by and large the majority of them try to leave. It’s incredibly disheartening. The Cuban state as a society makes this amazing investment in its young people to educate them, give them incredible skills and talents and creativity. Then they can’t offer them anything that makes it worth staying in their own country.

There aren’t high hopes that this is going to be some significant change. If anything, there’s a bit of trepidation about who the people who are going to take over really are. Díaz-Canel is perhaps known more in the province where he worked on the ground than he is known nationally. He has kept a low profile as first vice president. Other members of his generation who took a high profile found themselves purged. So he’s a survivor. But you don’t get to be to the top of the Cuban Communist Party and the president of Cuba without being a stalwart member of that system. There’s no evidence there will be a shocking change here. This is going to be a significant transition, but it’s also going to be an evolutionary one.

President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, has dropped his defamation lawsuits against Buzzfeed and the intelligence firm Fusion GPS. The move will allow him to avoid turning over information to the companies’ lawyers in legal proceedings.

Cohen, who is the subject of a Justice Department criminal probe, arranged a $130,000 hush money payment to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who alleges an affair with Donald Trump. Last week federal agents raided his New York office, seizing emails and other records related to the payment and other Cohen business dealings.

“The decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one,” Cohen attorney David Schwartz told Politico on Thursday. “But given the events that have unfolded, and the time, attention, and resources needed to prosecute these matters, we have dismissed the matters, despite their merits.”

Dropping the lawsuits could present multiple benefits to Cohen.

Cohen filed the two suits early this year, after Buzzfeed published a 35-page dossier authored by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Cohen has denied allegations contained in Steele’s report, in particular the claim that Cohen travelled to Prague during the 2016 election to collude with Russian officials on Trump’s behalf. In his original lawsuit, he assailed claims about a Prague trip as false and harmful to his reputation as a lawyer.

Last week, a McClatchy report cited two sources who claimed special counsel Robert Mueller has unearthed evidence showing Cohen “secretly made a late-summer trip to Prague during the 2016 presidential campaign.” Cohen again denied he had ever been to Prague, as did his lawyer.

Dropping the lawsuits could present multiple benefits to Cohen. He avoids having to turn over documents or answer questions as part of these civil cases, and the risk that information would be publicly disclosed. Such information could also be used against him in the federal criminal probe.

It may also strengthen an argument Cohen and his lawyers made as they petitioned a Los Angeles court last week to halt a lawsuit brought by Stormy Daniels to invalidate the 2016 non-disclosure agreement covering her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen argued his testimony in that case could affect his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the related ongoing federal investigation. That argument would have been much harder to sustain while leaving himself open to questioning in the civil lawsuits he initiated against Buzzfeed and Fusion GPS.Looking for news you can trust?

Late on Wednesday night, the Senate took the rare step of voting to change its own rules to allow infants who are less than 1-year old onto the chamber floor during votes.

The move was championed by Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who gave birth this month to a baby girl. In doing so, Duckworth became the first sitting Senator to be pregnant and have a child—a milestone that isn’t without its challenges: Senators cannot vote remotely, and Duckworth was concerned she might be kept out of the chamber because of Senate rules barring infants from the floor.

“If I have to vote, and I’m breastfeeding my child, especially during my maternity leave period, what do I do? Leave her sitting outside?” Duckworth told Politico in February.

Kaitlin Fahey, Duckworth’s chief of staff, explained in a statement given to CNN that the rule change was introduced “to ensure no senator with an infant is prevented from performing their constitutional responsibilities—and send a message that working parents everywhere deserve family-friendly workplace policies.”

“If I have to vote, and I’m breastfeeding my child…what do I do?”

The resolution passed unanimously, but not without some mostly older, male Senators expressing concern about babies’ potential danger to the Senate’s decorum.

Sen. Orrin Hatch told the Associated Press that he had “no problem” with the rules change, though he went on to ask: “But what if there are 10 babies on the floor of the Senate?”

“I’m not going to object to anything like that, not in this day and age,” Sen. Pat Roberts, (R-Kan.) told the AP.

But he pointed out that Senators can vote from inside the door of the cloakroom, just off the Senate chamber.

So allowing babies on the Senate floor, Roberts said, “I don’t think is necessary.”

On Thursday, Duckworth took advantage of her victory by bringing her daughter Maile on the Senate floor to participate in a confirmation vote for President Trump’s nominee for NASA administrator. Duckworth voted against Republican Rep. Jim Bridenstein, Trump’s nominee for the job. She arrived on the floor to applause from her colleagues. Predictably, the historic moment is going viral.

In the next few weeks, Detroit is set to start shutting off water to thousands of residents with unpaid bills. Since the shutoffs began four years ago, tens of thousands of Detroiters have had their water cut off, drawing sharp criticism from local anti-poverty activists as well as the United Nations.

Households are slated for shutoff once their water bill is 60 days or $150 past due. While more than 17,000 households are at risk, Gary Brown, director of the Detroit Water and Sewage Department, told the Detroit Free Press that roughly 2,000 will actually be shut off as more residents enroll in repayment and assistance plans. The city’s Water Residential Assistance Program (WRAP), for instance, offers up to $1,000 a year to help customers catch up on their accounts.

According to Brown, the average home slated for shutoff this year is $663 past due, and most water connections are restored within 48 hours of being turned off. City records obtained by Bridge Magazine show that the number of yearly shutoffs went from 33,000 in 2014 to 17,500 last year. Overall, there have been more than 101,000 shutoffs in the past four years.

In late March, Mayor Mike Duggan’s office touted the $7 million that has been spent in the last two years to help Detroiters facing shutoffs. Just the week before, the city council approved a $7.8 million contract to Homrich Wrecking for conducting water shutoffs.

Advocates who work with the poor black and brown Detroiters who are most vulnerable to losing their water say the city’s financial assistance programs are inadequate. They are little more than “a marketing plan being framed as a compassionate solution,” says Monica Lewis Patrick, president and CEO of We the People of Detroit, a grassroots group fighting the water shutoffs. Many Detroiters who enroll in payment plans are at risk of falling back into cycles of nonpayment, says Mark Fancher, staff attorney for the Racial Justice Project of the ACLU of Michigan. “Not because they’re lazy or just choosing to be poor,” but because “there are a whole lot of reasons why people are poor and there are lots of poor people in Detroit.”

“You can’t convince me that while you’re smiling at me and shutting my water off that this is good for me and you represent my interests.”

Brown told the Free Press that the tricky part of conducting shutoffs is “separating the truly needy from those who are just not paying.” That line of thinking, says Fancher, presumes that those who aren’t paying are “deadbeats that have the money, but have chosen not to pay. This is completely contrary to the reality of most people who are dealing with these shutoffs.”

In a city that’s 80 percent black, more than 35 percent of residents live in poverty, the highest rate among the nation’s 20 largest cities. Unemployment hovers around 9 percent and the median income is around $28,000. Yet water rates have climbed as much as 400 percent in the last 20 years.

Large-scale water shutoffs began in 2014, just as the city was crawling out from the wreckage of the country’s largest-ever municipal bankruptcy, pegged at $18 billion. The shutoffs have been advertised as an unavoidable, if painful, treatment for restoring the city’s fiscal health. In 2014, the office of then-Emergency Manager Kevin Orr referred to the shutoffs as “a necessary part of Detroit’s restructuring.” Patrick isn’t buying it: “You can’t convince me that while you’re smiling at me and shutting my water off that this is good for me and you represent my interests. As my grandmother would say, ‘You can’t piss on me and tell me it’s raining.’”

In 2014, two United Nations special rapporteurs declared the shutoff policy a “violation of the most basic human rights.” “I heard testimonies from poor African American residents of Detroit who were forced to make impossible choices—to pay the water bill or to pay their rent,” Catarina de Albuquerque, the special rapporteur on the human right to water and sanitation, said after visiting the city. Among the findings she recounted:

Ms. de Albuquerque cited the case of a woman whose water had been cut and whose teenage daughters had to wash themselves with a bottle of water during menstruation. In other instances, she continued, she heard mothers who feared losing their children because their water was shut off; heads of household who feared losing access to water without any prior notice; others who feared receiving unaffordable and arbitrary water bills.

Activists and researchers have pointed out that the Detroit Water and Sewage Department’s financial woes can’t be blamed entirely on the city, since it stretches far beyond the city itself, serving 40 percent of Michigan’s population. The progressive think tank Demos has described the decision to include the department’s $6 billon debt in the city’s bankruptcy filing as an accounting trick used to negotiate more favorable terms with lenders.

We the People of Detroit and other grassroots groups have been organizing to not only stop the shutoffs, but make water more affordable. Cities like Philadelphia are experimenting with tying residents’ water bills to their incomes to ensure that families don’t become trapped in a cycle of missed payments. We the People recommends that no family living at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty line ($25,100 for a family of four) pays more than roughly 3 percent of their income for water, the rate considered affordable under UN guidelines. (The Environmental Protection Agency pegs affordability at 4.5 percent of median household income.) In 2017, Michigan State University researchers found that the median household spends about $1,620 on water bills annually, roughly 6.5 percent of a poverty-line income. More alarmingly, they found that by 2022, water rates would climb to unaffordable levels for 35 percent of households nationally.

Under an income-based plan, Fancher says, many Detroiters would not be paying market rate for water, but they would be paying something, leaving the city in better financial shape than it is under the status quo: “You replace a whole lot of people who are paying nothing with a whole lot of people who are paying something. In the long run, the utility is far better off than it would be.”

However, the city has refused to alter water rates, insisting that its hands are tied by a state constitutional amendment that requires new taxes to be approved by voters. An affordability fee, Fancher argues, would not legally be a tax. The constitutional argument, he says, has been “a convenient excuse for not doing something that makes a whole lot of sense.”

Some water rights activists see the city’s intransigence as more evidence of a quiet campaign to push poor people of color out of the city. In a recent study, We the People found that many home foreclosures concentrated in Detroit’s black communities were driven in part by overdue water bills. “It’s about using water to displace residents in order bring in a younger, whiter population to dilute black political power in Detroit,” Patrick says. They are “weaponizing water as a tool of gentrification.”Looking for news you can trust?

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach was held in contempt of court Wednesday afternoon by a federal judge for failing to follow a court order to register voters in Kansas. Kobach, who led President Donald Trump’s election integrity commission and is the country’s most prominent advocate for restrictions on voting, “willfully failed to comply with the preliminary injunction” against the state’s law requiring proof of citizenship law for voter registration, Judge Julie Robinson, a George W. Bush appointee, ruled.

In 2013, Kobach pushed Kansas to enact a law requiring people to provide certain forms of documentation, such as a birth certificate, passport, or naturalization papers, to register to vote. The law prevented 35,000 Kansans from registering between 2013 and 2016. The ACLU filed suit and won a preliminary injunction in May 2016 blocking the law for the November 2016 election.

As part of the settlement, Kobach was supposed to mail a postcard to voters who were blocked from registering letting them now that they were now eligible to vote. He was also instructed by the court to update the state’s election manual, which Robinson called “the policy and training Bible for the 105 county election officials,” to let local officials know that the proof of citizenship law would not be in effect. But Kobach did neither.

“The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a valid court order existed requiring Defendant to ‘register for federal elections all otherwise eligible motor voter registration applicants that have been cancelled or are in suspense due solely to their failure to provide DPOC [documentary proof of citizenship’ and that Defendant had knowledge of the order,” Robinson wrote today. “The term ‘register’ is not ambiguous, nor should there have been any question that these voters were to be treated just like any other registered voter prior to the 2016 election.”

Kobach was repeatedly humiliated in court when he defended the law from a challenge by the ACLU in a March trial. Robinson scolded him for not following her earlier order, telling Kobach, “I made it clear they’re fully registered voters,” and pounding on her desk for emphasis. Despite Kobach’s assertion that “the illegal registration of alien voters has become pervasive,” his own hand-picked witnesses could not cite a single instance where votes by non-citizens decided an election, nor did they support his debunked claim that Trump lost the popular vote in 2016 because of illegal votes. The judge repeatedly lectured Kobach on “Evidence 101” when he tried to present evidence that was not properly submitted to the court.

This is not the first time Kobach, who is now running for governor of Kansas, has been formally sanctioned by a federal judge. After the election, Kobach gave Trump a copy of a proposal for a federal amendment to allow states to require proof-of-citizenship for registration, but he later told the court that “no such document exists.” He was sanctioned by a magistrate judge and fined $1,000 for “deceptive conduct and lack of candor.” When Kobach appealed, Robinson upheld the fine and said Kobach had “a pattern” of “misleading the court.”

An opinion in the proof-of-citizenship case is expected later this year.Looking for news you can trust?

Last week, the US House Agriculture Committee released a draft of the farm bill, the once-every-five-years legislation that shapes and funds the country’s agriculture funding and policy. On Wednesday, the ag committee approved it, setting it up for a vote on the House floor.

It would gut what is arguably the most important program to encourage farmers to protect soil and water resources.

Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi (D.-Calif) quickly denounced the proposal, declaring, “Democrats cannot support this radical, harmful Republican bill.” It wouldn’t just add stringent work requirements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the nation’s main food-aid initiative. It would also gut what is arguably the most important program to encourage farmers to protect soil and water resources: the Conservation Stewardship Program.

The program helps farmers defray costs for implementing practices like cover crops to keep soil and fertilizer in place over the winter; buffer strips that prevent severe soil erosion from storms; and hedgerows as habitat for wild bees and other beneficial insects. At its current $1.8 billion funding level, CSP can’t keep up with demand from farmers—last year, there was enough money to fund just 6,500 of the 19,000 applications the program received. Which is too bad, because as a new report from Environmental Working Group shows, the kind of practices promoted by the CSP need to be dramatically expanded to stop widespread soil erosion and water pollution in Midwestern farm country.

Meanwhile, under the 2014 farm bill that expires in September, the federal government spends around $14.6 billion annually in commodity and crop-insurance subsidies, which encourage farmers to churn out as much crop as possible with minimal environmental strings attached.

The farm bill draft currently being mulled in the House would keep those subsidies intact while folding the CSP into another, similar conservation initiative called the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. While that may sound innocuous, the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition shows that the move would shave off nearly $5 billion from conservation funding over 10 years.

The group also notes that CSP generally takes a more comprehensive approach than EQIP to funding on-farm sustainability: “While EQIP provides one-time assistance to correct a problem or add farm infrastructure, CSP provides ongoing performance-based stewardship payments to support advanced conservation systems.”

But here’s the thing: The bill is virtually dead on arrival. Ferd Hoefner, senior strategic adviser for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition and a longtime farm bill observer, says the ag commitee’s version will likely never pass the House. Moderate Republicans oppose the SNAP changes and hard-right Republicans oppose essentially all anti-hunger and farm spending.

Even if Republicans do pass the bill through the House, he adds, their SNAP agenda will run into a brick wall in the Senate, where the GOP leadership has vowed to maintain the status quo. And according to Hoefner, the Senate agriculture leadership, Republican and Democratic alike, have shown no appetite for slashing conservation funds.Looking for news you can trust?

Louisiana has notoriously overworked and underfunded public defenders. Lawmakers are now considering a bill to pad their budgets with cash. The only problem? Public defenders hate the proposal.

The bill, which is currently awaiting debate in the Louisiana House, would increase the amount of money allocated to the state’s public defender offices by the Louisiana Public Defender Board, their umbrella organization. The board would be required to set aside 70 percent of its budget for local offices, up from 65 percent. The change would mean a $1.7 million increase in funding for public defenders.

That obviously seems like a win for the lawyers who represent the indigent. But public defenders have been vocal in their opposition to the proposal. Why? It would likely fund the offices by slashing the budget of legal aid organizations like the Innocence Project New Orleans, which works to overturn wrongful convictions, and the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights, which provides public defense for juveniles.

“I certainly don’t think it’s the solution,” Derwyn Bunton, chief district defender of Orleans Public Defenders, told Mother Jones. “It’s going to be inefficient, unfair, and unjust.

Louisiana’s public defenders have been in crisis for years. According to a 2016 report released by the board, on average public defenders handle caseloads twice the recommended state limit: In a particularly egregious example, one rural district’s average caseload is 4.39 times the limit. Several parishes have been forced to employ attorneys in other fields to alleviate the shortage. In 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of inmates against the Public Defender Board and the Orleans Parish office, claiming the refusal of the office to accept new cases violated inmates’ constitutional right to counsel. In a 2016 interview with Mother Jones about the ACLU lawsuit, Bunton justified his office’s choice to quit taking on cases, saying, “I think where we would be violating the Constitution and ethics and professional standards would be to continue to take on cases we don’t have the resources to handle.”

Organizations like the Innocence Project New Orleans and the Louisiana Center for Children’s Rights help public defenders shoulder the burden of massive caseloads by taking on cases that are too costly or complex for them to handle. Louisiana has the second-highest exoneration rate in the nation, meaning a cut to the Innocence Project’s funding could slow down exonerations and leave more innocent people behind bars. (Louisiana has the highest rate of incarceration in the country.)

That’s where the bill comes in. Legal groups worry that the proposal, which they say is likely to pass, would simply move money from legal aid groups to the public defenders instead of actually increasing resources for public defense. State Public Defender Jay Dixon, a member of the Public Defender Board, told Mother Jones that to meet the requirement of the bill, funding from legal aid groups will almost certainly be cut.

Emily Maw, director of the Innocence Project New Orleans, told Mother Jones the organization receives $360,000 annually from the Public Defender Board, a little over a third of its total budget. Maw said the organization could be forced to close if the bill passes.

“[The bill will] do nothing to solve the unsustainable, unpredictable, and grossly disparate funding the public defenders get,” she said. “It will only put at risk programs that are safety nets for either the most serious charges (capital cases), or the most vulnerable citizens (children), or people who have been completely disserved by Louisiana’s lack of care.”

Dixon said the bill would “cripple” the already limited resources public defense has.

“It’s good [Louisiana is] thinking about how to deploy resources. On the other hand, taking money away from Peter to pay Paul is not the way to do it.”

In an interview with New Orleans’ Times-Picayune, Republican Rep. Sherman Mack, the bill’s author, defended the proposal, saying he is responding to complaints from district attorneys about the backlog in public defender offices.

Unlike other states, Louisiana’s public defender offices are funded primarily by fees incurred through traffic tickets, leaving their budgets at the mercy of what happens in the courts. A 2017 investigation by nonprofit news organization The Lens found that traffic fines in the state are increasingly being diverted to district attorneys and pretrial diversion programs instead of going through the lower-court system, which means no revenue for public defenders.

The public defender shortage is not unique to Louisiana. Although a comprehensive picture of the situation is difficult to discern, since many states don’t produce data on the status of their public defense systems, a 2007 Justice Department report found that 73 percent of local public defense systems were operating above capacity, and it’s likely the problem has only gotten worse since then as state budgets across the country have been slashed.

“It’s good [Louisiana is] thinking about how to deploy resources,” Marc Schindler, executive director of the Justice Policy Institute, told Mother Jones. “On the other hand, taking money away from Peter to pay Paul is not the way to do it.”Looking for news you can trust?

Things have gone sour for New York’s dairy industry, the third-largest of any US state. Years of low milk prices have led to steady stream of farm closings and farmer suicides. The industry’s workforce, which includes large numbers of immigrants, faces low wages, long hours, and high injury rates.

And now, the area’s farms apparently have another headache: raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Syracuse Post-Standard recently reported on an incident at a dairy farm in Rome, New York:

John Collins was standing outside the milk house at his dairy farm this morning when he heard yelling coming from inside. He ran in, he says, and saw his worker, Marcial de Leon Aguilar, pinned up against the window by armed men.

In this video, Collins shares his story with a Post-Standard reporter:

In the video, Collins claims the ICE officials roughed up the worker, de Leon Aguilar, and then interrogated him in front of his school-age children. They also declined to show Collins a warrant for entering his farm. Collins says when he ordered the ICE agents to leave and began attempting to video-record the interaction with his phone, an agent threw his phone into the road and handcuffed him before eventually releasing him.

In an email, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls stated that “ICE deportation officers arrested Marcial DeLeon-Aguilar, a citizen of Guatemala illegally residing in the U.S., on immigration violations. ICE previously removed DeLeon-Aguilar from the U.S. on three occasions, most recently in January 2014. He has criminal convictions for reckless aggravated assault and illegal re-entry and is currently in ICE custody.” He added: “With respect to judicial warrants, federal immigration law clearly provides for the arrest of removable aliens based on administrative arrest warrants issued by authorized immigration officers.”

Walls declined to comment on whether ICE disputes Collins’ account of how the interaction played out.

US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D.-NY) expressed outrage over the incident at the dairy farm:

Deeply troubled by this report from Rome, NY. ICE officers should not be allowed to raid private property without a warrant. There must be an immediate investigation into what happened here. https://t.co/0eBEDAUQV8 — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 18, 2018

A 2015 report by Texas A&M agricultural economists found dairies that employ immigrant labor produce 79 percent of the US milk supply. Workers on dairy farms earn an average annual wage, including benefits, of $34,443. The researchers calculated that eliminating immigrant labor would cause retail milk prices to rise by 90.4 percent.Looking for news you can trust?

Donald Trump has had trouble finding any decent lawyers who are willing to work with him on the Russia probe, so he’s finally decided to let his pal Rudy Giuliani come on board. But what exactly is Giuliani’s role going to be? Here are three takes:

New York Times: Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and longtime friend of President Trump, will join the president’s legal team in an effort to “quickly” resolve the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to Trump associates. Wall Street Journal: In an interview, Mr. Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said his first task after joining the team will be to “find out what Bob Mueller needs” to complete the investigation. “I’m pretty sure we can comply with it,” he said. Mr. Trump’s legal team has “worked so hard to get this done. Hopefully we can speed it up,” Mr. Giuliani said. Washington Post: “I’m doing it because I hope we can negotiate an end to this for the good of the country and because I have high regard for the president and for Bob Mueller,” Giuliani said in an interview.

Giuliani wants to “quickly” resolve the investigation. He wants to “speed it up.” And he wants to “negotiate an end” to it. In other words, he’s less a lawyer than he is an ambassador to Robert Mueller. And apparently he thinks he can wrap things up in just a few weeks.

This is from a Fed Note published in 2016:

The column on the far right is the one to look at. It means that the likelihood of buying a car didn’t change much for different age groups once you control for family and income:

In summary, the probability model of new vehicle purchases that includes controls for employment, income, and other household characteristics suggests that the differences in average vehicle purchasing rates observed among age groups appear to reflect economic and (non-age) demographic factors….Using a probability model and household-level vehicle purchasing data, we find that new vehicle purchasing rates by age group have declined since 2007, but these declines do not appear to differ significantly by age group once we condition purchases on economic factors such as income and employment. Our results suggest the decline in the per capita rate of new vehicle purchases since 2007 more likely reflects economic factors than permanent shifts in tastes and preferences for vehicle ownership.

The authors suggest that young people are buying cars at about the same rate as always, once you control for income and family. The Great Recession was a big hit on incomes, of course, one that we’ve only barely begun to make up. And young people have been starting families at steadily later ages since at least the Baby Boomers:

I’ve been playing around with pictures of the night sky lately, and as you can imagine I’ve had varying success here among the bright lights of Orange County. The best I can do locally is out around Silverado Canyon, which is only a so-so viewing spot. But it’s good enough to let me figure out how best to set up the camera for future efforts.

I took these photos last night, which is the last moonless night for a while. The top photo is just an ordinary exposure, with the the Big Dipper highlighted. Polaris is right in the bend of the tree, so it was a good angle. Once all that was done, I set the shutter on Bulb and let the camera sit there for a while in order to get a nice photo of star trails.

I had planned to let it go for three or four hours, and I even brought along a Mophie battery pack so my camera could last that long. But after about an hour or so, clouds rolled in and I packed up. The Clear Sky Chart for Irvine had indicated that the cloud cover would change between midnight and one, but the change it showed was so abrupt that I didn’t really believe it. However, it turned out to be almost spookily accurate, and when I woke up this morning there was actual water falling from the sky.

Still, the result wasn’t too bad. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to do much better than this around here, but sometime in the next month or two I think Marian and I might take a short vacation to some nice, dark spots out in the desert. We just haven’t figured out which desert yet.COVER STORIES
