President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen indicated in a court filing on Wednesday that he will assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in a lawsuit filed by adult film actress Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump.

BREAKING: Michael Cohen, @realDonaldTrump lawyer and confidant will plead the 5th… https://t.co/60uM1b4bmr — Carol Leonnig (@CarolLeonnig) April 25, 2018

Cohen, who is a subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, cited a recent raid of his New York office, noting that federal agents “seized various electronic devices and documents in my possession,” including materials related to a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. Daniels alleges she previously had an affair with Trump. A federal judge in New York is slated to hold a hearing on Thursday about the materials.

“Based upon the advice of counsel, I will assert my Fifth Amendment rights in connection with all proceedings in this case due to the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI and US Attorney for the Southern District of New York,” Cohen said.

Daniels’ lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called Cohen’s decision a “stunning development” in the case. The adult film actress sued President Trump in March to get out of a nondisclosure agreement from October 2016.Looking for news you can trust?

The Department of Housing and Urban Development, led by Secretary Ben Carson, has drawn up a proposal that would overhaul how rents are calculated for low-income families using federal housing subsidies.

The proposal, first reported by the Washington Post, would increase renters’ share of a unit’s cost from 30 percent to 35 percent, and eliminate key deductions, including those for childcare and medical costs, now used to calculate how much families owe. HUD current technically allows local housing agencies to charge the neediest renters a minimum rent capped at $50 a month; the proposal would triple that cap to $150.

The proposal would need to be approved by Congress before being implemented. But if enacted, the move would affect approximately 4.5 million families that currently rely on HUD’s rental assistance programs.Looking for news you can trust?

Last year, Howard “Buck” McKeon, a former Republican congressman who chaired the House Armed Services Committee, was hired to lobby for an Albanian political party seeking access to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. But most of his firm’s work was bankrolled by a Cypriot shell company called Dorelita Limited. The outfit was created by a Cyprus-based lawyer who specializes in forming offshore corporations and who was affiliated with companies linked to a prominent Russian oligarch. Yet this shell company is now controlled, at least on paper, by an Athens-based attorney who in the past has advised a controversial Greek billionaire. The source of the money that flowed from Dorelita to the McKeon Group, the lobbying shop McKeon established in 2015 after leaving Congress, remains murky. That, in fact, may be the point.

The arrangement raises questions about who paid for US lobbying on behalf of a small Albanian third party called the Socialist Movement for Integration (known by its Albanian abbreviation, LSI) in advance of elections in the country last year. The mysterious deal provides another example of murky interests using offshore entities using the US political system to try to influence Balkan politics. Last month, Mother Jones reported that Nicolas Muzin, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) who also worked for the Trump campaign, was paid by a Scottish shell company with ties to Russian nationals to lobby for the conservative Albanian opposition party.

McKeon’s work for Dorelita also highlights how lax US lobbying laws make it easy for foreign interests to use shell companies and front groups to push their agendas in Washington without disclosing their identities or purposes. And this tale shows how players around the world can utilize shell companies—which can be whipped up in countries that have few disclosure requirements—to anonymously wield political influence in the United States and elsewhere.

“The primary purpose of offshore shell companies in secrecy jurisdictions like Cyprus is to hide sensitive activities,” says Jeffrey Winters, a Northwestern University political scientist who studies financial networks and how the ultra-rich use shell companies. “There are red flags all over this deal.”

“A good and very special relationship”

In January 2017, the McKeon Group signed a $15,000-a-month contract with the LSI, Albania’s third largest political party, to lobby on its behalf in Washington and promote its head, Ilir Meta, then the speaker of the Albanian parliament. At the time, Albania, a majority Muslim country of 2.9 million that borders Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro, was ramping up for its presidential and parliamentary elections, to take place in April and June 2017, respectively.

The LSI has traditionally played the role of political kingmaker in Albania, and it was then in a coalition government with the ruling Socialist Party of Albania. But this alliance was fraying, and the LSI would soon team up with the right-leaning Democratic Party of Albania (DPA). Meta, meanwhile, was gunning for the presidency, a mostly ceremonial post elected by the parliament. But should Meta win that position, the LSI would gain a political boost.

Meta is a longtime politician who served as Albania’s prime minister from 1999 to 2002. He was controversially acquitted in 2012 of bribery charges stemming from a video that showed him discussing apparently corrupt deals with another former minister. Meta is “perceived by many citizens to be a symbol of corruption,” according to a recent report by Freedom House, a nonprofit watchdog organization based in Washington.

The source said the primary goal of the Dorelita contract was to get Meta “access to” President Trump, in the form of a meeting or a photo op.

McKeon’s contract with the LSI called for his firm to arrange for Meta to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration and organize meetings with “key DC leaders” during the inaugural festivities. After Trump’s swearing-in, according to the contract, the lobbying firm was to help “develop a good and very special relationship with the incoming Administration and Congress.” The contract was signed not by LSI officials but by an acquaintance of one of the party’s members: an Athens-based lawyer named Iraklis Fidetzis.

In mid-January, Meta traveled to Washington to attend Trump’s inauguration, and during his stay McKeon brokered meetings for the Albanian politician with Republicans including Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) and Reps. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), Mike Turner (R-Ohio), and Ed Royce (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Washington is full of lobbyists who rep foreign regimes and interests. So it was not odd for the LSI to try to find supporters in Washington. Last year, Albania’s three leading parties each employed lobbyists to cultivate ties with DC politicos. But what is curious is what happened after the McKeon Group reported in February 2017 that it had wrapped up its lobbying contract with the LSI.

The following month, on March 24, the McKeon Group inked another contract signed by Fidetzis—this time to lobby for Dorelita Limited, which listed its “primary offices” at the same address in Athens as Fidetzis’ law firm. A source familiar with the contract said Fidetzis had suggested paying the McKeon Group to continue to work for the LSI through this corporate entity. The new lobbying contract, covering a year of work, paid more than three times what the McKeon Group had earned under its previous deal with the LSI: $50,000 a month, plus expenses.

The source said the primary goal of the Dorelita contract was to get Meta “access to” President Trump, in the form of a meeting or a photo op. That effort failed.

But the contract and other paperwork the McKeon Group filed for its work for Dorelita made no mention of LSI. The registration the firm submitted to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act to represent Dorelita stated only that McKeon’s firm would try “to manage meetings between U.S. government officials and Dorelita Limited.” The paperwork, in other words, suggested that the McKeon Group was lobbying for a company with its own independent agenda. But that was not the case.

“That’s why you use shell companies”

Dorelita, it turned out, was a shell company with what seemed like one purpose: to provide payment for McKeon’s lobbying for the LSI. The firm was incorporated in 2013 by a Greek attorney named Andreas Petrou. He runs a law office in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia that creates and administers shell companies. The firm says about one-third of its clients are Russian, and it advertises a special phone number for Russian speakers. According to Russian and Cypriot business records, Petrou’s firm was involved with Cyprus-based companies that are linked to Oleg Deripaska, the Russian aluminum magnate, whose business relationship with Trump’s indicted campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has entangled him in the Trump-Russia scandal. Two Deripaska-linked businesses were headquartered at the same address as Petrou’s law firm: EN+ Corporate Services Limited and ACL Aluminum Constructions Limited, where according to Cyprus business records, Petrou was the director. Russian corporate filings note that Petrou was also affiliated with four other Russian businesses that were part of Deripaska’s aluminum empire. Earlier this month, Deripaska and several companies he controls were sanctioned by the Treasury Department.

After Mother Jones sent Rusal, the Moscow-based aluminum conglomerate owned by Deripaska, a list of questions about the oligarch’s ties to Petrou, the company replied by email that the “allegations are false, groundless and defamatory” and threatened legal action. But a spokesperson subsequently confirmed Petrou’s law firm had been hired by one of Deripaska’s companies to provide “corporate and secretarial services.” Deripaska has for years used Cyprus—among other offshore locales—as a corporate home for some of his businesses. The spokesperson denied any connection between Dorelita and Deripaska and said the oligarch had no business interests in Albania.

Mother Jones sent a reporter to Petrou’s office in Cyprus, where a board with brass plates showed the names of about 40 other companies that appear to be registered at the same address. Petrou, who an assistant said was not present, later responded via email. He said he provided “nominee services” for two Deripaska-connected outfits. That means the businesses paid him to serve as a stand-in on paper as an officer or shareholder. Such arrangements may serve to mask a company’s real owners. Petrou said he was ending his firm’s relationship with Deripaska’s businesses due to the recent sanctions imposed on the oligarch and his firms by the US government.

“Name Dorelita was rejected several times by the clients because as they told me it sounded as the name of a lady dancer in Mexican night club.”

“The main activity of my office for the last 25 years is the incorporation of companies in Cyprus and other jurisdictions abroad and the provision of fiduciary services to our clients as well,” Petrou stated in an email. And he provided some of Dorelita’s backstory. He explained that the company “was kept in our offices as a shelf company”—that is, a ready-made corporation left dormant until it would be sold to a buyer either looking to avoid the hassle of incorporating a new company or seeking an outfit with an established corporate history.

According to Petrou, a banking crisis that hit Cyprus in 2013 sharply reduced demand for his services, “and as a result of this a lot of our shelf companies remained unsold.” Dorelita, he said in an email, was particularly difficult to offload: “Name Dorelita was rejected several times by the clients because as they told me it sounded as the name of a lady dancer in Mexican night club.”

Eventually, he found a buyer. On February 22, 2017, he sold Dorelita to Iakovos Taliadoros, the managing director of a Nicosia-based accounting firm, for 1,000 euros. Petrou said he had no involvement with Dorelita after that “and therefore there is no any knowledge from our side concerning the structure and ownership of the company and its activities.” Taliadoros refused to answer questions about Dorelita.

Shortly after Dorelita changed hands, Iraklis Fidetzis—who Taliadoros confirmed is his client—was named the company’s director. According to the Athens-based law firm of Papaconstantinou & Partners, where Fidetzis serves as of counsel, he specializes in “financial matters and investments” and has “wide and long international experience” in these areas.

Fidetzis, who did not respond to inquiries, has worked as an adviser to Dimitris Kontominas, a Greek billionaire and owner of a television station who was charged in 2016 with tax evasion and money laundering. Kontominas has faced accusations of several alleged financial crimes during his career, without any apparent convictions. A former Macedonian intelligence official said in a 2014 deposition taken by the US Securities and Exchange Commission that Fidetzis was present at a 2005 meeting when Kontominas allegedly arranged to bribe Macedonia’s prime minister and other officials on behalf of a telecommunications company called Magyar Telekom. The alleged bribes were paid through Cypriot shell companies controlled by Kontominas. The SEC investigated the case because the telecommunications company was owned by Deutsche Telekom, at the time traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Deutsche Telekom and Magyar Telekom paid a combined $95 million penalty in 2011 to settle charges that they had violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Two former Magyar Telekom executives paid a combined $400,000 in fines in the United States in April 2017 to settle individual cases. Kontominas was not charged.

It was the month after Fidetzis took control of Dorelita in early 2017 that he signed the new lobbying deal between the McKeon Group and the shell company. The lobbying firm’s subsequent filings with the Justice Department provide inconsistent information about its work for Dorelita. In December, the McKeon Group filed a notice with the Justice Department that said it had terminated its representation of Dorelita as of March 28, 2017. But that was the same day the firm registered to work for Dorelita and four days after the contract was signed.

According to this December filing, the lobbying firm severed its ties with the shell company before performing any work. But that was not what happened. In April 2017, the McKeon Group contacted a host of congressional Republicans to set up meetings for Dorelita, according to another filing McKeon submitted to the Justice Department. And multiple sources tell Mother Jones some of these meetings related to the LSI. A spokesman for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who met LSI officials, says they “did not appear to have a specific ‘ask’ and it was more of an introduction.” Dorelita, the Lee spokesman said, was not discussed. Lobbying disclosures the McKeon Group filed with Congress stated that the firm continued to represent Dorelita through December 2017. In total, the company reported earning at least $65,000 for its work for Dorelita. It was paid $15,000 by the LSI.

The LSI denies any connection to Dorelita. A spokesman for the party said it had “zero contact with and zero knowledge about” the company. The spokesman noted that a prominent party member, Vangjel Tavo, had connected the party to Fidetzis and that later Tavo approved the $15,000 payment from the LSI to the McKeon Group. A doctor and a member of Albania’s Greek minority, Tavo visited the United States in late April 2017, days before Albania’s parliament elected Meta the country’s president. He was in Washington on the days that McKeon scheduled meetings with members of Congress on behalf of Dorelita, raising the possibility that he may have taken part in these sit-downs. Tavo did not respond to a request for comment.

Arben Cici, who serves as director of cabinet for President Meta, said in an email that Meta since his election has had no relations with lobbyists or “any political force.” Cici did not respond to questions about Meta’s ties to Fidetzis or Dorelita.

McKeon declined to speak to Mother Jones about his firm’s work for the shell company. McKeon’s son, Howard McKeon Jr., who works with his father and was involved in the Albanian project, also would not discuss the matter. McKeon’s wife, Patricia, who is listed as a contact on disclosure documents filed with Congress regarding Dorelita, hung up when contacted by a reporter.

There is no law against accepting payments from a foreign shell company for lobbying, according to experts on lobbying rules. But the Foreign Agents Registration Act does require disclosing the foreign government or political party that is a principal beneficiary of lobbying work—and the McKeon Group did not identify the LSI or Albania as the beneficiary of its work for Dorelita. “If [McKeon] knows, or has every reason to believe, that the work he is doing is really being directed by the party, and they are the real client, then he has got to disclose that,” says Joseph Sandler, a Washington lawyer with expertise on FARA compliance. “It doesn’t really matter who pays. Your foreign principal under FARA has to be the person for whom you’re an agent. The whole point of the law is to disclose who you’re really working for.”

Yet the whole purpose of an offshore shell company is to obscure the true interests behind it. “That’s why you use shell companies,” says Jack Blum, a Washington lawyer with expertise in international tax avoidance. “For secrecy.” Indeed, it seems unlikely that Fidetzis, who has no apparent Albanian interests, was financing Dorelita’s expensive lobbying campaign himself. And he was possibly acting on behalf of another party. So the question remains: Who was funding pro-LSI lobbying in the United States, and what was the objective behind this influence campaign? Peeling back the layers on Dorelita does little to clear this up—but the story of this shell company does reveal much about how the murky foreign influence game is played in Washington.

If President Donald Trump can ban people from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States, could an anti-Semitic president ban all residents of Israel from coming?

That was among the tough questions the Supreme Court’s liberal justices posed to the Trump administration as it defended its travel ban on Wednesday. And the lawyer representing the government was put in the uncomfortable position of answering yes.

Wednesday’s arguments over the legality of the travel ban marked the first time in which the court will rule on a key Trump policy. The ban, which Trump enacted via an executive order in September, prevents around 150 million people from seven countries, most with a Muslim majority, from entering the United States. Hanging over the justices’ deliberations were the president’s statements about Muslims during his 2016 campaign, when he pledged to ban all Muslims from coming to the country. Opponents of the travel ban have argued that those comments suggest the travel ban is really Trump’s Muslim ban in disguise and should be struck down as discriminatory.

The unusual nature of the case led the justices to pose a series of hypotheticals to the government’s lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco. The first came from Justice Elena Kagan, who posited a future scenario in which someone campaigns for president as a virulent anti-Semite. Once in office, the new president asks his Cabinet to help him design a new travel ban. “What emerges is a proclamation that says, ‘No one shall enter from Israel,'” she imagines. Can such a ban pass constitutional muster?

Francisco replied that if the Cabinet said, “There is honestly a national security risk here and you have to act,” then the president “would be allowed to follow this advice, even if in his private heart of hearts he also harbored animus.”

The hypothetical gets at the heart of the constitutionality of the travel ban, and whether the president, after calling for a “total shutdown” of Muslims entering the country, can persuade the justices that his ban does not discriminate on the basis of religion.

“Campaign statements” are made by “private citizens,” Francisco argued. There is a “fundamental transformation” from candidate to president, and only the comments of the sitting president would trigger constitutional questions.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the swing justice on contentious cases, chimed in with another hypothetical. “Suppose you have a local mayor, and as a candidate he makes vituperative, hateful statements,” he said. “He’s elected, and on day two he takes acts that are consistent with those hateful statements. Whatever he said during the campaign is irrelevant?” Francisco replied, “I would say yes,” because the government believes that the oath of office “marks a fundamental transformation.”

The outcome of the case could hinge on Kennedy’s interest in the questions raised by these hypotheticals involving the First Amendment’s prohibition on government actions that favor certain religions over others. At oral arguments, the liberal justices appeared skeptical of the ban, and the conservatives appeared poised to support it. Only Kennedy seemed undecided. Once again, the fate of one of the country’s most controversial policies is likely to come down to him.Looking for news you can trust?

Speaking before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday morning, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered an impassioned, wide-ranging speech rebuking some of President Donald Trump’s signature policies while urging the United States not to close its doors to the international community.

“There is no Planet B.”

The remarks, which prompted standing ovations from Democrats in the chamber, were seen as a veiled but sharp denunciation of his American counterpart’s doctrine. He urged the US to rejoin the Paris climate agreement—”There is no Planet B,” Macron said, sparking loud applause—and condemned the rise of nationalism throughout the world.

“We can choose isolationism, withdrawal, and nationalism—this is an option,” Macron said. “It can be tempting to us as a temporary redemptive to our fears. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse, but inflame, the fears of our citizens.”

Macron’s speech comes at the end of a three-day state visit to Washington where the two world leaders appeared to go out of their ways to demonstrate a strong bond, repeatedly shaking hands and patting each other’s backs. “We do have a very special relationship,” Trump said Tuesday, before brushing off what he said was a piece of dandruff from Macron’s shoulder on live television.

A report released by the Education Department on Tuesday reveals that black students and students with disabilities are still suspended and arrested at much higher rates than their classmates, further complicating Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ reconsideration of an Obama-era rule meant to curtail the disproportionate punishment of students of color.

According to the Education Department, 2.7 million K-12 students were suspended at least once during the 2015-16 school year, the most recent year for which data is available. Black students make up 15 percent of students enrolled in schools across the country but accounted for 39 percent of those suspended out of school at least once. Black boys, who make up 8 percent of the student population, accounted for 25 percent of suspended students, while black girls (another 8 percent of students) accounted for 14 percent of those suspended.

Of the 120,700 students expelled from school in 2015-16, 33 percent were black. Black students were also overrepresented among those who were physically restrained (27 percent) and secluded in rooms in which they were prevented from leaving (23 percent).

What’s more, black students were more likely to get referred to law enforcement and arrested at school, a notable finding considering the Trump administration called for more cops in schools following the Parkland shooting. Black students account for 31 percent of all referrals to law enforcement, up 4 percentage points from the 2013-14 school year.

Students with disabilities, meanwhile, were subject to 26 percent of out-of-school suspensions, even though they made up 12 percent of students.

Suspensions can ultimately lead to a loss of instruction time that could overwhelmingly fall on students of color and those with disabilities. A report released last week by the UCLA Center for Civil Rights Remedies and Harvard Law School’s Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice found that black students with disabilities were more likely to be suspended and lost 77 more days of instruction, on average, than their white peers. In at least 28 states, the gap between disciplining black students with disabilities and white students worsened between 2013-14 and 2015-16.

Dan Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at UCLA, tweeted out several examples of what the newly released discipline data meant in several urban school districts:

New OCR data on Memphis show Black males lost 83,727 days of instruction due 2 out of school suspensions, yet only 43,216 Black males r enrolled. That =s 194 days lost for every 100 Black males! Every district reports days lost showing profound impact on ed opportunity .@losendan — Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018

Ferguson MO schools Black males lost 9,905 days of instruction 2 suspension with only 4,695 enrolled =s 211 days per 100 enrolled + White mls lost 54 days per 100. 157 more days lost per 100 for Black mls @SarahDSparks @EricaLG OCR released data but this not mentioned. .@losendan — Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018

OCR data out today, in Jefferson Cty Kentucky, Black males lost 115 days lost 2 out of school suspension per 100 enrolled which is 81 days per 100 more than the 34 days lost for white mls enrolled. A devastating racially disparate impact on educational opportunity. .@losendan — Dan Losen (@losendan) April 24, 2018

On April 4, DeVos held closed-door listening sessions with educators and advocates on both sides of the Obama-era discipline rule. The guidance, issued in 2014, seeks to ensure that schools don’t disproportionately punish black and Latino students for wrongdoing and encourages schools to look at their own disciplinary policies. Members of a White House school safety commission, overseen by DeVos, is looking into repealing the guidance.

That same day, a report released by the Government Accountability Office found that black students, students with disabilities, and boys were far more likely to be disciplined than their classmates. The GAO report notes that “implicit bias” from teachers and staffers “may cause them to judge students’ behaviors differently based on the students’ race and sex.”

In December, the Education Department also proposed delaying another Obama-era guidance, known as the significant disproportionality rule, that’s meant to require states to look at whether schools are overidentifying students of color for special education or disciplining students of color at higher rates.

For the first time in Donald Trump’s presidency, the Supreme Court will begin hearing a case Wednesday in which it will decide the fate of one of his key policies. At stake is his travel ban, which bars entry into the United States by people from several Muslim-majority countries.

The court has already allowed the ban to go into effect while it hears the case. That means that thousands of American citizens and residents, foreign students, and their loved ones are feeling the effect of the ban, which applies to most nationals of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, as well as certain Venezuelan officials. We asked some of those people what they want the Supreme Court to know as it hears oral arguments on Wednesday. Here are some of the stories they shared.

Amin lives in Missouri, but his father was denied a visa to visit him:

I really miss my dad and I know he misses me a lot, but he tries to stay strong. But I cannot give him even a tiny bit of hope for being with him again after all I see the Trump presidency has brought to immigrants life, especially Iranian families. The worst part is I really fear something happen to my dad and…and I won’t forgive myself for coming to U.S. for studying, working and following my dreams… IF the travel ban stays in effect, I have planned to move to another country or even back home.. I have to leave everything I have worked for here.. but at the same tie I do not want to live in a country where the government bans me from visiting my family.

Rosita Oloumi , 34, has lived in the United States since she was 16:

I would want [the justices] to know that not everyone is a bad person! We have families on the other side of the world and this ban has separated us. I feel like my country has betrayed me!… In August of 2016 I got engaged to the love of my life. I met him when I had to travel back to Iran after 13 years being away and attend my father’s funeral… He had his interview in August 2017. We have been waiting for the response from the embassy ever since. We were told that the administrative processing will take 4-6 months. Obviously that is not the case. It’s been 8 months already. I am 4.5 months pregnant with a baby girl who might not even see his father as a result of this travel ban!

Fatemeh Karimi lives in the United States with her children:

I applied for my husband’s visa on January 2015 and he had his interview on January 2017. Now it’s been more than one year we are waiting for his visa. My husband has missed almost 3 year of our children’s lives and now we all have stressful times here. It’s very hard. We were born in Iran but even though we were not living there we are banned! This also is effecting my sons education and grades and my daughter hasn’t had as much positivity in her than she did before. My son sees the therapist but it doesn’t help because the only thing he needs is his father, he’s just a little kid. This is the time he needs his father the most. The only thing we want is to be like other families. Together. Not separated.

With the backing of President Trump, former Republican state senator Debbie Lesko won a special election Tuesday to fill a House seat vacated by Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct.

Lesko beat political novice Hiral Tipirneni with 53 percent of the votes in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, an area that covers Phoenix’s northwest suburbs and traditionally skews conservative—Trump won the district by 21 percentage points in 2016.

Tipirneni got 47 percent of votes.

“This is so awesome,” Lesko said, shortly after unofficial results were announced. “It’s overwhelming.”

On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his support of Lesko.

Arizona, please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08. Strong on Border, Immigration and Crime. Great on the Military. Time is ticking down – get out and VOTE today. We need Debbie in Congress! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2018

Registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the district by 19 percent, according to the Arizona Secretary of State. But, bolstered by Connor Lamb’s upset last month in Pennsylvania, Democrats had been hoping Tipirneni’s story as a first-generation immigrant who became a physician and her affordable health care platform would create similar results in the red district.

Unlike Lamb’s Pennsylvania constituency, the Arizona district is known for its sleepy retirement communities—roughly a quarter of residents are over 60—and its voters’ devotion to former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, according to FiveThirtyEight. Republican Rep. Franks, who stepped down in December after reports that he offered a staffer $5 million to carry his child, ran unopposed in 2014 and 2016.

Democrats in the district rely on minority voters for wins—the group that is least likely to turn out for off-year elections.

But Lesko’s win isn’t necessarily an indication of an end to a nationwide Blue Wave.

Democrats outperformed Republicans in the red-leaning district by 19 percentage points, based on FiveThirtyEight’s analysis that the district leans red by 25 percentage points. That’s on par with the national average—17 percentage points—since Trump’s inauguration, according to FiveThirtyEight. The margin is in spite of a last-minute influx of about $1 million into the race from outside GOP groups, and a robocall in which Trump warned Tipirneni’s victory would mean, “illegal immigrants will pour right over your border.”

The relatively close race may even position Democrats to better challenge Republicans in November. Democrats have plans to flip at least one Arizona chamber and Sen. Jeff Flake’s (R-Ariz.) U.S. Senate seat. One senior Democratic Party official told CNN earlier this month that they saw the special election “as a test run of how we are going to gear up for 2018.”Looking for news you can trust?

A federal judge in Washington, DC, just dealt a major blow to the Trump administration’s plans to end protections for undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children.

In an order issued Tuesday evening, US District Judge John D. Bates called the decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, “arbitrary and capricious,” and ordered the Trump administration to continue the program and accept new applications. The judge gave the administration 90 days to defend its decision before the ruling would take effect.

Bates wrote that the administration failed to adequately explain why it believes the program was unlawful, and that its “meager legal reasoning” and the Department of Homeland Security’s assessment of litigation risk was not a sufficient reason to sustain the program’s termination.

He is the third judge to rule against the Trump administration’s decision to rescind DACA, according to the Washington Post.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has decided not to steer clear of the Justice Department’s investigation into President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, according to a Tuesday report.

Sessions’ decision not to recuse himself from the probe into Michael Cohen raises questions both about his earlier pledge to recuse himself from any investigations related to the 2016 presidential election, and about the details of the Cohen probe itself. Bloomberg, which first reported Sessions’ decision to retain oversight, said the attorney general would consider stepping back from certain portions of the Cohen investigation.

Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to confirm or comment on Sessions’ decision to Mother Jones. Sessions has “said repeatedly that he consults career ethics advisors on any matters that come to his desk to determine whether he needs to be recused—as do all lawyers at the department,” Flores noted in an email.

In March 2017, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from “any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States” due to his role as a campaign adviser to Donald Trump.

It’s hard to see how the Cohen investigation wouldn’t be related to the campaign. The probe, which is being conducted by the office of the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, reportedly relates to Cohen’s election-eve payment of $130,000 through a Delaware shell company to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic actress. Cohen says he paid Daniels as part of a contract in which she agreed not to publicly discuss her claim that she had sex with Trump in 2006, when he was already married to his wife, Melania. Investigators appear to be looking at whether the payment, which Cohen claims he made without Trump’s knowledge, constituted an in-kind contribution to the Trump campaign that would exceed the legal limit for donations. Neither Cohen nor the Trump campaign reported the payment as a contribution.

In March 2017, Sessions said he would recuse himself from “any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President.”

“To the extent campaign finance issues are part of the investigation, Sessions should be recused under department rules,” says John Bies, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel who is now chief counsel at American Oversight, a watchdog group that has faulted Sessions for not adhering to his recusal.

Sessions’ original recusal caused him to step aside from the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia. That investigation was later taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Sessions’ recusal enraged Trump, who has publicly berated his attorney general for failing to protect him from the probe.

Since then, under White House pressure, Sessions has appeared to walk back his recusal. In a letter last year, the Justice Department acknowledged that Sessions played a role in responding to congressional Republicans’ calls for the department to investigate issues related to Hillary Clinton, when it boasted he personally “directed senior federal prosecutors” to undertake such a review. Sessions also oversaw a decision to fire FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, though Trump had urged McCabe’s ouster due to McCabe’s role in probes related to both major 2016 presidential candidates. (Check out our timeline of Sessions’ apparent recusal violations.)

Trump renewed his attack on Sessions’ original recusal after federal agents raided Cohen’s property on April 9. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that Cohen will not “flip” and cooperate with prosecutors to build a case against the president. The New York Times has reported that Trump sees the investigation into Cohen as a bigger threat than Mueller’s probe.

Sessions’ decision not to recuse himself from Cohen’s case means that he can receive briefings and retain some control over an investigation that threatens Trump. Sessions could even influence decisions by prosecutors, including whether they should pursue subpoenas. His decision leaves Session in a position where Trump can seek information about the course of the probe, or to pressure him to curtail it.

Bies says that Trump’s attacks on Sessions highlights the need for Sessions to recuse himself from the Cohen probe. “It would be very troubling if the president’s pressure affected how the attorney general thought about when he should recuse himself,” Bies says.Looking for news you can trust?

On Monday, a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Dallas County Republican Party that would have kicked most Democratic candidates in the Texas county off the ballot.

The lawsuit, filed in January, tried to keep 127 Democratic candidates from appearing on the March 6 primary ballot, in a county that tends to vote Democratic. The suit was later amended to apply to the November election, and the number of candidates whittled down to 82.

The suit argued the Democratic party chair, Carol Donovan, did not properly authorize the ballots for most of the party’s 150 primary candidates. Had District Judge Eric Moyé ruled in the GOP’s favor, the suit would have disproportionately affected voters of color, who overwhelmingly cast their ballots for Democrats in the state, Randy Johnston, the attorney representing the Democratic Party in the case, told Mother Jones in January.

The lawsuit named candidates for Texas’ state Senate and House, plus county judge, county commissioner, and justice of the peace. Many of those seats in Dallas County are typically held by Democrats. The suit was stalled for several months after Dallas County Republicans tried to get Moyé to recuse himself. Moyé is a Democrat, and has donated to local and national Democratic candidate campaigns.

The Dallas Morning News reported Monday that Donovan, the Democratic party chair, said the decision “ensures that democracy has been protected.” Donovan, it appears, emerged from the lawsuit relatively unscathed. She overwhelmingly defeated her challenger for the Democratic party chair seat, according to Dallas County Elections results.Looking for news you can trust?

The mother of Michael Brown, the teenager whose police killing in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked unrest in 2014 and was a major catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, said on Monday that she is considering running for Ferguson’s city council. Lezley McSpadden made her announcement during a panel discussion on police violence at Harvard University.

“We have to get behind people who look like us and get them in these elected seats so that they can really do what’s right by the community, and I’m going to start with me by running for Ferguson City Council,” McSpadden said to applause.

“What a legacy that would be—elected to the City Council and supervising the same police that killed Michael Brown,” added McSpadden’s attorney, Ben Crump, who was also on the panel. Crump is also representing the family of Stephon Clark, the unarmed 22-year-old shot and killed in March while he was in his grandparents’ backyard in Sacramento, California.

“What a legacy that would be—elected to the City Council and supervising the same police that killed Michael Brown.”

Ferguson’s residents are predominately black, but its city council and police department were both predominately white when Brown was killed. In April 2015, in the first municipal election following Brown’s death, Ferguson residents elected two black candidates to its city council, bringing the total number of black members on the six-member council to three.

Since her son’s death, McSpadden completed her high school diploma, wrote a book, and joined Hillary Clinton on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. If she runs, she would not be the first relative of a black victim of a recent, high-profile, race-tinged killing to do so. Lucy McBath, the mother of 17-year-old Jordan Davis, who was shot and killed at a Jacksonville, Florida gas station in 2012 by a white man upset about the volume level he was playing music in his car, announced earlier this year that she is running for the U.S. House of Representatives in her home state of Georgia. McBath told Mother Jones in an April interview that she dropped her standing bid for a seat in Georgia’s statehouse to enter the higher-profile House race after the Valentine’s Day high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.Looking for news you can trust?

President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to suggest that amid recently surfaced allegations of workplace misconduct, Ronny Jackson, his embattled pick for Veterans Affairs secretary, should withdraw his nomination, calling it “totally” Jackson’s decision. The president also characterized the vetting process for cabinet nominations as the work of a “vicious group of people that malign”—a likely reference to members of the media and bipartisan lawmakers leading the vetting process.

“I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, ‘What do you need this for?’ This is a vicious group of people that malign—and they do and I live through it, we all live through it,” Trump told reporters at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. “You people are getting record ratings because of it, so congratulations.”

“He’s an admiral, he’s a great leader,” the president continued. “They question him about every little thing.”

Trump took aim at the routine scrutinization that reportedly prompted the bombshell accusations surrounding Jackson to emerge—ignoring the fact that the president himself put Jackson in the position of facing the rigorous process without having properly vetted his choice beforehand. “I don’t want to put a man through a process like this,” he said. “It’s too ugly and too disgusting.”

Jackson, a combat veteran who has worked as a White House physician for 12 years, has been under intense scrutiny amid allegations from White House medical staff that include excessive drinking on the job and improperly prescribing drugs. The claims threaten what was already a fraught nomination, with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressing serious concerns over Jackson’s glaring lack of management experience to lead a historically troubled department.

During his remarks as he stood with French president Macron on Tuesday, Trump acknowledged that Jackson had an “experience problem,” though he denied having knowledge of the specific allegations that first surfaced Monday. Trump’s afternoon remarks appeared to undercut the White House statement earlier in the day expressing confidence in Jackson’s record of “strong, decisive leadership.”Looking for news you can trust?

While welcoming French President Emmanuel Macron to the Oval Office Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump warmly discussed the “special relationship” the two world leaders share, even praising news outlets he typically bashes as “fake news” for correctly describing their friendship in recent reports.

He then demonstrated just how uniquely close their bond is by proceeding to flick a piece of dandruff from Macron’s shoulder. Leaving no room for speculation over the bold move—Trump explained his action in front of dozens of reporters on live television. “We do have a very special relationship,” the president said. “In fact, I’ll get that little piece of dandruff off.” He then added, “We have to make him perfect. He is perfect.”

The painful moment below, followed by a useful reminder from my colleague that sometimes art can’t compete with the absurdity that is the Trump administration:

The White House on Tuesday defended Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, after troubling allegations surfaced surrounding Jackson’s workplace conduct.

“Admiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in serve to this country,” a statement from White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley read. “He’s served as the physician to three Presidents—Republican and Democrat—and has been praised by them all.”

The expression of support came shortly after a Senate committee announced that it was indefinitely postponing Jackson’s confirmation hearings—which were originally scheduled to start Wednesday—as lawmakers became aware of the accusations. The exact nature of the allegations have not been confirmed, but CBS News reported late Monday that they included claims of “excessive” drinking on the job, “improperly dispensing meds,” and that he had created a “hostile work environment.” (The New York Times separately confirmed those allegations later on Tuesday.) It is unclear if the allegations came from current or previous White House medical staff.

The statement from the White House Tuesday appeared to hit at such concerns, adding that “Admiral Jackson’s record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what’s needed at the VA to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.”

This new information threatens to upend an already fraught nomination, with both Republicans and Democrats having voiced serious concerns over Jackson’s lack of management experience to helm one of the most troubled agencies in federal government. (Jackson was a combat surgeon in Iraq and has worked at the White House for 12 years, serving under former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.)

Trump’s decision last month to replace his Veterans Affair secretary with Jackson reportedly did not involve any proper vetting normally reserved for a cabinet position. Jackson first received national attention in January after delivering a glowing report on Trump’s physical and mental health.Looking for news you can trust?

In the first week of his presidency, Donald Trump requested that Congress give Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enough money to hire 5,000 new agents to patrol the US-Mexico border as part of his immigration crackdown. The move raised eyebrows among immigration activists and experts, who had been monitoring the agency’s poor discipline record and had seen cases of corruption spike in the wake of such hiring sprees.

New records obtained by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO) reveal that their concerns may not have been misplaced. Since 2016, there have been 40 cases of corruption-related charges against CBP employees, including 13 since Trump took office. Overall, 80 Border Patrol agents and 127 CBP officers have been arrested or charged with corruption-related crimes since 2004. Records show that between February 2017 and mid-March 2018, CBP employees racked up charges including embezzlement, human smuggling, theft, bribery, breaking and entering, money laundering, providing false statements, and using firearms during drug-related crimes.

In early 2016, the Department of Homeland Security declared that corrupt border agents “pose a national security threat” and found that the CBP had a “broken disciplinary process.” James Tomsheck, the former head of Internal Affairs at CBP, has repeatedly warned about corruption at the agency. He maintains that its background investigations of new employees are sorely lacking, that it sweeps corruption allegations under the rug, and that it largely resists efforts to clean house. In an interview with Mother Jones last year, Tomsheck claimed that the head of the Border Patrol agents’ union had “opposed every integrity proposal” he had made during his eight years at CBP. (The National Border Patrol Council did not respond to requests for comment.)

The Department of Homeland Security has declared that corrupt border agents “pose a national security threat.”

Some of the crimes committed by border agents on the job have been extreme. While on patrol in March 2014, Border Patrol agent Esteban Manzanares kidnapped, assaulted, and raped two Honduran girls and their mother. He committed suicide when FBI agents surrounded his home. In late 2016, the discovery of a headless body a few hundred feet from the shore of South Padre Island in Texas led investigators first to an assassin for the Gulf Cartel and eventually to a Border Patrol agent who had run guns and drugs across the border.

The 210 corruption cases documented by POGO are just those that have come to light and in which legal action was taken. In 2014, the American Immigration Council published data on 809 complaints of alleged abuse by Border Patrol agents from 2009 to 2012. In 97 percent of the cases, Border Patrol took no action on the complaints. The same year, Tomsheck told Reveal that at least a quarter of violent incidents involving Border Patrol agents were “highly suspect,” adding that “in nearly every instance, there was an effort by Border Patrol leadership to make a case to justify the shooting versus doing a genuine, appropriate review of the information and the facts at hand.” In 2016, Reveal identified 140 CBP officials who had been arrested or convicted for acts of corruption including weapons charges, drug smuggling, and human trafficking.

Experts worry that increased hiring without improved oversight will make a bad situation worse. Joshua Breisblatt, a policy analyst at the American Immigration Council, says that in previous hiring surges, “You saw a huge increase in the budget for Border Patrol and CBP, but you did not see a corresponding increase for the appropriate oversight. You did not see a corresponding increase in the DHS civil rights and civil liberties budget; you did not see an increase in the DHS Inspectors General budget. For the longest time, CBP Internal Affairs did not actually have the ability to investigate shootings done by Border Patrol agents.” Tomsheck argues that in order to fulfill Trump’s hiring request, CBP is taking an “unacceptable shortcut” by outsourcing background checks to private companies to recruit agents more quickly.

In a statement, POGO Executive Director Danielle Brian said, “Without appropriate oversight, corruption can—and will—spread like a disease, even within law enforcement. The danger of corruption is significantly increased as the president pushes to quickly hire new agents to beef up security at the border.” As Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego and co-chair of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, told POGO, CBP employees “have this extraordinary power, and they have a de facto immunity because they have no meaningful oversight and accountability.”Looking for news you can trust?

Nearly a week before thousands of Colorado teachers are expected to descend on the state capitol to rally for better pay and protest potential retirement benefit cuts, two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to try to stop them from striking in the future.

The bill, introduced Friday by state Sen. Bob Gardner and Rep. Paul Lundeen, would stop public school teachers and teachers’ unions from organizing strikes against employers. School districts would be barred from paying teachers who participate during the time of the strike. The districts could also seek an injunction to stop a strike from happening.

If teachers failed to comply, they could face up to $500 a day in fines and up to six months in county jail—and if found in contempt of court, they could be fired without a hearing.

The bill, which is seen as a long shot to make it through the state Legislature, came just days after hundreds of Colorado educators rallied in Denver, joining educators in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Arizona in protesting for better pay and funding for public schools. Gardner told the Denver Post on Monday that the idea for the proposed legislation emerged after the strike in West Virginia, and he noted he was open to changes in the penalty for teachers who strike, adding it was “probably most important” that unions are penalized for sponsoring a strike.

“It’s a wise thing to do, in some shape or form, in the state of Colorado because we have one district that’s already voted to strike. We have others discussing a strike,” Gardner told the Post. “Strikes are not good for children.” On Twitter, Colorado Senate Democrats slammed the bill as “anti-worker trash.”

This bill is anti-worker trash. Republicans would rather pay to throw teachers in jail than pay them to teach. #copolitics https://t.co/WXxhIUEyFO — Colorado Senate Dems (@COSenDem) April 23, 2018

Last week, the Colorado Education Association, the state’s teachers’ union, announced that a statewide rally would take place this Thursday and Friday, prompting several school districts to cancel classes for those days, including eight of the state’s largest districts, affecting more than 400,000 kids.

Colorado teachers were among the lowest paid in the country in the 2016-2017 school year, making an average of $46,506, a 15 percent drop from the 1999-2000 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Educators there get paid worse than their peers who aren’t teachers, earning just 65 cents for every dollar other college graduates make, according to the Economic Policy Institute. In Arizona, where educators are expected to participate in a walkout on Thursday, that number is 63 cents.

At the same time, according to the Colorado Education Association, the state’s teachers spend an average of $656 out of their own pockets to pay for school supplies every year.Looking for news you can trust?

In a major reversal, Republican Sen. Rand Paul announced Monday afternoon that he would support Mike Pompeo’s nomination to be secretary of State. The Kentucky senator had previously criticized Pompeo’s support of the Iraq War and had threatened to vote against him in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Had Paul done so, Pompeo would likely have failed to win support from a majority of the committee—though he would likely still have been confirmed by the full Senate.

Paul tweeted Monday that he “received assurances” from President Donald Trump and Pompeo that Pompeo now believes “that the Iraq war was a mistake, and that it is time to leave Afghanistan.” Paul then announced he would vote in favor of Pompeo’s nomination.

Last August—eight months before Travis Reinking allegedly killed four people and wounded four others at a Tennessee Waffle House—Illinois law enforcement came to take away his guns. The then-28-year-old had a history of mental health issues and run-ins with the local sheriff’s office. About two weeks earlier, the US Secret Service had arrested Reinking for entering a restricted area near the White House.

Reinking surrendered four firearms: an AR-15, a 9mm handgun, and two hunting rifles. His firearm owner’s identification card was also revoked. (In Illinois, most people need this card to legally own a gun.)

“We need laws to very clearly lay out the procedures for removing guns and how the guns are going to be stored.”

The officers took the weapons from Reinking—but then they immediately gave them to his father, Jeffrey Reinking, who has a valid firearm owner’s card, the Tennessean reported. The father “was advised that he needed to keep the weapons secure and away from Travis,” and he “stated he would comply,” according to a Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office report from the time quoted by the Tennessean. That fall, Travis Reinking moved to Tennessee.

Early Sunday morning at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, Travis Reinking allegedly opened fire with the AR-15 he had surrendered less than a year before. Four people were killed and four others were injured. An unarmed patron wrestled the semi-automatic rifle away from the shooter, who fled on foot. Police took Travis Reinking into custody on Monday afternoon.

Jeffrey Reinking admitted to local law enforcement that before the shooting, he had given the confiscated guns back to his son. It’s unclear whether the transfer took place in Illinois or Tennessee (or somewhere else), which could have implications for whether Jeffrey Reinking violated the law.

BREAKING: Federal agent: Waffle House shooting suspect's father "could potentially" face charges for giving weapons back to son. — The Associated Press (@AP) April 23, 2018

On Monday, I spoke with Lindsay Nichols, federal policy director at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, about the Illinois law that allowed police to remove Travis Reinking’s weapons—and that allowed them to turn over those same weapons to Reinking’s father. Here’s our conversation, lightly edited for length for clarity.

Mother Jones: Why were Travis Reinking’s guns taken away? Why were they then given to his father?

LN: Illinois has gun laws that are relatively stronger than the majority of gun laws in the country. The state requires a person who has a gun to generally have a license called a firearm owner’s identification card (FOID card). It has a process for removing guns when a person loses the eligibility to possess them. Most states have really no process for this. Illinois’ law is also stronger in that there is a way for a law enforcement officer—in this case it was FBI—to say this is someone who should not have a gun.

The FBI person told the state police that [Travis Reinking] was someone who should not have a gun under the Illinois clear and present danger law. This law was enacted in 2013 after Sandy Hook, and it allows law enforcement officers to make those reports and have someone’s gun eligibility taken away. That imposes a certain responsibility on state police to revoke the person’s FOID card and send a revocation notice to the person, who usually has to surrender the FOID card and fill out a form saying how they are disposing of their guns. In many of these cases, a law enforcement officer will go out to the person’s house and make an effort to make sure the person’s guns are removed. That’s what happened here.

In those circumstances where the guns are removed or the person surrenders, the person is often given the authority to decide who is going to keep these guns or how they are going to be kept. In this case, it sounds like his father was going to keep them, and his father was eligible because he had a FOID.

MJ: In these situations, can the police take guns away and simply hold onto them themselves?

LN: They can seize them. There is some question about the reluctance of law enforcement to store guns that belong to the public. It is a responsibility that some law enforcement agencies are reluctant to do, because it is property that belongs to a member of the public. Because of that reluctance, we need laws to very clearly lay out the procedures for removing guns and how the guns are going to be stored.

We are working towards that. You may have heard of extreme risk protection orders. In those bills [also known as “red flag laws“], there is very clear language stating that the law enforcement agency must store the guns and that they can only return them under specific circumstances. They may seem tedious to talk about, but they are very important parts of the law that need to be included because of situations like this—because of situations where [law enforcement officials think]: “Oh, it would be so much easier if a family member would just hold onto it for him, during this period where he is ineligible to possess a gun. We’ll just let them do it.”

That has all sorts of dangers. The possibility that a disqualified person is going to get their guns back by persuasion, or coercion, or stealing is really great. The best approach is to have law enforcement hold onto those guns.

MJ: Does this transfer of confiscated weapons happen often?

LN: This an area where there is a lot of variation. There are probably 10 or 15 states that have some provision that says something along the lines of, “You have to surrender your guns.” Hardly any of them really specify how or to whom. There is a larger number of states who address this issue specifically with regard to domestic violence protective orders. That’s a policy based on the extreme danger that often exists in these domestic violence situations.

But only a few states have expanded that, or set up procedures to address the issue: When people lose their eligibility to possess a gun, how do we make sure that they no longer have guns or that they surrender the guns they own?

MJ: Was it legal for Jeffrey Reinking to give the guns back to his son?

LN: It seems from the facts that we know about here that the father did violate the law [if the transfer took place in Illinois]. There is a law in Illinois that very explicitly says it’s illegal to knowingly transfer a gun to a person who does not have a FOID card.

MJ: Once he moved to Tennessee, could Travis Reinking have been eligible under state law to own a gun?

LN: It seems very likely to me that Tennessee laws would not have prohibited him from owning guns. Tennessee does not have a clear and present danger-type law. Generally in Tennessee, unless someone was convicted of a crime or was committed to a mental institution, which I don’t think he was, he would have been eligible to posses a gun in Tennessee.Looking for news you can trust?

After a brief hiatus, President Donald Trump is back to tweeting that Mexico should crack down on migrants. Trump wrote Monday morning that Mexico “must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S.” and said his administration might not approve a new free trade agreement with Mexico if the country ignores his demands. Like similar tweets from earlier this month, his attacks came shortly after Fox News reported on a “caravan” of Central American migrants traveling north through Mexico.

Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2018

Trump did not specify what he hopes Mexico will do to stop people from coming to the United States, but his administration has been pushing Mexico to adopt a “safe third country” agreement that would allow the United States to return Central American asylum seekers to Mexico, despite significant concerns about Mexico’s ability to protect people fleeing persecution. The United States has a similar agreement with Canada. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement on Monday that her department “encourages persons with asylum or other similar claims to seek protections in the first safe country they enter, including Mexico.”

But if Trump’s aim is to get Mexico to agree to a “safe third country” deal, then he’s long been undermining his own effort. Trump’s frequent attacks on Mexico have pushed the country away from taking in more asylum seekers. Last week, an unnamed Mexican official told Politico that Mexico was open to striking an asylum deal until Trump reportedly “lost his temper” during a February call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. The call and Trump’s refusal to back down from insisting that Mexico will pay for his proposed border wall led Peña Nieto to cancel plans to travel to the United States to meet with Trump, the Washington Post reported in February.

Mexico’s presidential election officially began in late March, and there seems to be little chance that Peña Nieto, who cannot run for reelection, will hurt his party’s political standing by caving to demands from Trump, who is extremely unpopular in Mexico. (Only 5 percent of Mexicans have at least some confidence that Trump will do the right thing on world affairs, according to a 2017 survey from the Pew Research Center.) One hour after Trump’s tweets, Mexico’s foreign secretary, Luis Videgaray, tweeted that Mexico determines its own immigration agenda and that it would be “unacceptable” to tie the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to unrelated policies.

The advocacy group Human Rights First found last year that Mexico is “far from a ‘safe third country.’” The group reported that people in Mexico who “fear persecution are often deported back to danger” and that Mexican immigration agents “often do not take the steps necessary to allow them to apply for asylum.” The number of asylum applications filed in Mexico increased by nearly 700 percent between 2013 and 2016, further straining Mexico’s underfunded asylum agency.

The Trump administration does not appear particularly concerned by those findings. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called for expanding safe third country agreements in October, and Republicans in Congress are backing legislation that would allow immigration authorities to return Central Americans asylum seekers to Mexico, regardless of whether Mexico signs a safe third country agreement. But the bill has little chance of becoming law, so Trump’s best option is to negotiate an agreement. Instead of doing that, he is publicly attacking Mexico during an election in which the country’s political leaders are under pressure to show they can stand up to Trump.Looking for news you can trust?

Service opened with the choir’s performance of Survivor by Destiny’s Child #BeyonceMass pic.twitter.com/j453R2dWLa — Brandon E. Patterson (@myblackmindd) April 26, 2018

A San Francisco church held a worship service Wednesday night themed on the teachings of… Beyoncé.

Grace Cathedral, an historic episcopal church known for its commitment to social justice, hosted its “Beyonce Mass” as part of a weekly worship series intended to uplift the experiences of women and appeal to young worshippers. The unconventional service featured a sermon about liberation struggle, readings from a speech by civil rights leader Ella Baker, scripture readings by black women, a traditional communion, and of course, the singing of Beyoncé songs. A gospel soloist backed by a choir and live band performed Beyonce’s songs “Listen,” “Freedom,” “Flaws and All,” and “I Was Here,” as well as “Survivor,” a hit by Beyonce’s original girl group Destiny’s Child.

News of the planned service appeared in more than two dozen local and national news outlets—including the New York Times. Not surprisingly, the church was mobbed. Ushers estimated there were about 900 people in attendance—Grace’s Wednesday night service normally attracts 50 or so.

The sermon was delivered by Rev. Yolanda Norton, a professor at the San Francisco Theological Seminary who specializes in black feminist interpretations of the Bible, and who helped organize the service. The notion of a Beyoncé mass ruffled some feathers, with conservative Christian voices mocking the idea or claiming the church was deifying Beyoncé—as if she’s not been deified already.

Beyoncé’s Coachella set has inspired me to do squats again. Praise Beysus 🙏🍋🐝 — Tilly (@TllySggtt) April 16, 2018

I’m still not over Beychella 🙏🏼 #praisebeysus — Savannah Devereux (@SavannahJoelle1) April 16, 2018

Norton rejects that claim: “Our goal is to have a worship experience that honors the fact that we’re all created in the image of God,” and stipulates that that image “includes black women,” she told me. A note on the church’s website adds that the service was intended to show how Beyoncé’s art “opens a window into the lives of the marginalized and forgotten, particularly Black women.”

Beyoncé received acclaim for her 2016 album Lemonade, which was widely interpreted as a reflection on both the hurt that black women sometimes experience in romantic relationships and the trauma they’ve endured over generations from the double-whammy of being black and female in America. But the lyrics to many of her songs, when viewed as a conversation with God, are ripe for use as hymns, Norton adds.

As an example, she cites “Flaws and All” from Beyoncé’s sophomore album B’Day: “She talks about being a train wreck. She talks about, ‘When I need attention I tend to nag.’ All the things that she says in there, whoever she’s talking to, if we make that in our worship a song to God, that’s exactly what we do,” Norton says. “So put that into that context and then have this chorus, ‘I don’t know why you love me, and that’s why I love you.’ That to me is a perfect conversation with God.”

Beyonce has identified herself as a “devout Methodist.” The name of her girl group was also drawn from a Bible verse.

Here are a few more highlights I shot at Beyoncé Mass:

The New York Times obtained audio of a tense three-hour meeting between NFL players and owners in October that sheds new light on how the two sides sought to deal with the fallout from ongoing national anthem protests—including President Donald Trump’s relentless criticism of the league.

During the meeting, which included 30 owners, league executives, and players at the NFL headquarters, players wondered why free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick—who kicked off the anthem protests in 2016 and has gone unsigned since he opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers last March—was being blackballed. (Kaepernick is currently in the middle of a labor grievance against the league, alleging owners colluded to keep him out.) The Times reported that his former teammate Eric Reid told the group he felt Kaepernick “was hung out to dry.”

“Everyone in here is talking about how much they support us,” Reid told a silent room. “Nobody stepped up and said we support Colin’s right to do this. We all let him become Public Enemy No. 1 in this country, and he still doesn’t have a job.”

“The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interests of America.”

Owners were relatively quiet on the Kaepernick issue, but many—including those who had long supported Trump—had plenty to say about what the league should do to fix its image in the midst of the president’s assault on the NFL.

“The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don’t feel is in the best interests of America,” said New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, whose Kraft Group contributed $1 million to Trump’s inauguration committee.

Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, the rare Democratic donor among NFL owners, told the group, “We’ve got to be careful not to be baited by Trump or whomever else.” Some of Lurie’s players, including Malcom Jenkins and meeting attendee Chris Long, were among the most vocal athletes during the anthem protests, and it’s unclear whether the team, which went on to win this year’s Super Bowl, will visit the White House.

“You fellas need to ask your compadres, fellas, stop that other business, let’s go out and do something that really produces positive results, and we’ll help you.”

Houston Texans owner and GOP megadonor Bob McNair insisted that players stop kneeling altogether. “You fellas need to ask your compadres, fellas, stop that other business, let’s go out and do something that really produces positive results, and we’ll help you,” McNair said. McNair, who contributed to Trump’s campaign and inaugural committee, ended up apologizing after the meeting when ESPN reported that he also told the group that owners “can’t have the inmates running the prison.”

Perhaps one of the strangest comments, though, came from Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula, who argued that the league needed to learn from the National Rifle Association and elevate a spokesman like Charlton Heston to combat its “media problem”—and that that spokesman needed to be black: “For us to have a face, as an African American, at least a face that could be in the media, we could fall in behind that.”Looking for news you can trust?

On Christmas Eve 2008, the president of the Marshall Islands declared a state of emergency after seawater flooded the country’s biggest urban areas, displaced hundreds of islanders, destroyed dozens of homes, and contaminated freshwater reserves. But this wasn’t some freak storm or tsunami; it was a garden-variety, seasonal storm surge, coupled with high tides—and it marked the third time that month the country had been hit by a major flooding event.

“If the tide had been two feet higher, it would have been much worse,” said Deborah Manase, then the deputy director of the Office of Environmental Planning and Policy Coordination.

Nearly a decade later, Manase’s words sound foreboding. By some estimates, sea level is projected to rise at least that much by 2100, thanks to climate change, but now scientists are saying thousands of islands may become uninhabitable even sooner than that due to frequent flooding and, consequently, freshwater contamination. Specifically, most low-lying atoll islands (islands formed of coral) will lack potable water by 2050, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.

Those islands could include, according to the authors, the Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, Gilbert Islands, Line Islands, Society Islands, Spratly Islands, Maldives, Seychelles, and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

“Historically, these islands would be over-washed every 20 to 30 years, due to a big North Pacific winter storm or the passage of a typhoon,” Curt Storlazzi, the lead author on the study and a research geologist with the US Geological Survey, tells Mother Jones. “However, what we started to see is, because sea level is rising, these events are now happening multiple times per decade.”

To get their projections, researchers from the USGS, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, International Atomic Energy Agency, and the University of Hawaii studied Roi-Namur, an atoll island in the Marshall Islands chain located in the central Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the Philippines. Using the terrain measurements of Roi-Namur, they built computer models that could predict how sea-level rise would affect its freshwater resources and similar, low-lying islands.

Based on current greenhouse gas emission rates, sea-level rise will “lead to the annual wave-driven overwash of most atoll islands by the mid-21st century,” the authors write. This will cause “frequent damage to infrastructure” and the “inability of their freshwater aquifers to recover” between flooding events, leaving the islands without a clean water source.

“They are asking the right question,” says Bob Kopp, director of the Institute of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Rutgers University, who was not involved with this study. But Kopp said it’s worth noting some of the scenarios in the study showed “implausibly rapid rates of sea-level rise in the first half of the century.”

Still, Kopp doesn’t deny the threat is very real. “Based on the work they’ve done, it is likely that—even under an aggressive mitigation scenario—in the lifetime of children living on the Marshall Islands today, that [freshwater contamination] threshold is going to be crossed.”

For many island nations, expensive infrastructure projects, like desalination plants, aren’t an option, and residents will likely need to relocate, says Storlazzi. Globally, nearly 750,000 people live on atoll islands, he adds, which means the world could see an unprecedented mass of climate refugees fleeing their home islands in a few decades.

Without alternative options, experts say the safest bet is to simply prepare for the inevitable. “It’s a lot more cost-effective when you can plan for mitigation or relocation before a potential disaster rather than dealing with one,” says Storlazzi. “So that’s our ultimate goal: it’s really to save dollars and lives.”Looking for news you can trust?

If you’re locked up in Texas and want to earn a master’s degree, you’re out of luck unless you have a penis. That’s right: Although the state incarcerates more women than any other, its prison system denies female inmates access to educational programs offered to men, according to a startling new report by the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition.

The report was released Tuesday and points out several jaw-dropping disparities in educational programming: It says men in Texas state prisons can get vocational certificates for 21 occupations, ranging from computer technology to cabinet-building, while women can only earn certification in two—office administration and culinary arts/hospitality. According to the report, male and female inmates can both take courses through the Windham School District, but men can choose from 48 courses and women only get 21.

Male inmates can choose from 48 courses offered by a school district and female inmates only get 21.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) has since slammed the report as “a significant mischaracterization of the facts,” arguing that the allegations about certification programming are “simply not true.” The report states that female inmates are limited to associate’s degrees. Jeremy Desel, a spokesman for the Department of Criminal Justice, acknowledged that women inmates in Texas state facilities can’t earn a master’s degree. But he said prisoners at 3 of the state’s 15 facilities for women can earn bachelor’s degrees in business administration and liberal studies from Texas A&M University.

The report’s author, attorney Lindsey Linder, says the data she cited came straight from the department itself, as well as from Windham School District. “I reported everything they gave me,” she says, referring to information from the corrections department. She added that the department had an opportunity to review the entire report before it was published.

“The master’s degree program for men is offered at a single unit that’s in close proximity to an educational institution,” says Desel by way of explanation about the disparities. “The majority of our women’s units are all in the same geographic area—that may be part of the issue.”

In contrast with the report’s findings, he added that women can get certification or training in more than 35 vocational occupations ranging from embroidery and sewing-machine operation to cabinet-making. He could not immediately comment on the number of certifications offered to male inmates. “Certainly we are active in doing our best as an agency to make sure there are as many programs and possibilities educationally, vocationally, and otherwise for women, men, and the entirety of the offender population,” he added, noting that the agency recently created a new position to focus on those issues.

When I asked Linder about the claim that geography might limit educational access for women, she wasn’t immediately convinced. “You can get all manner of degrees online, so I can’t imagine there aren’t programs that would be accessible through telecommunication,” she pointed out. When I told her the Department of Criminal Justice said dozens of certificates were available to women, rather than just two, she reiterated that the department reviewed the statements in her report before publication. She says she met personally with the department’s executive director, Bryan Collier, and his team, and that she incorporated their feedback into the final study. “They raised no concern with the certification programming we reported,” she adds.

Most women in the system are locked up for nonviolent crimes, and about two-thirds of them have not completed high school.

While men outnumber women in Texas state prisons, female inmates are a quickly growing population: Their numbers increased more than 900 percent from 1980 to 2016, compared with a nearly 400 percent increase in male prisoners. Most women in the system are locked up for nonviolent crimes, according to the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, and about two-thirds of them have not completed high school, while more than half were living below the federal poverty level at the time of their offense.

The coalition’s report found that state prisons offer more rehabilitation programs to men than to women, a claim that the Department of Criminal Justice spokesman was not able to immediately confirm or deny on Tuesday. “Women deserve to have equal opportunities to these programs,” says Linder. “Without equal access to educational vocational programs, they don’t have the same opportunity to succeed.”

Here’s more information from the coalition’s report and from the Department of Criminal Justice’s spokesman. The first two tables show the report’s account of programs offered by gender. The second two lists show the department’s account of educational and vocational programs for women.Looking for news you can trust?

Alcohol can cause cancer. That’s the takeaway from Mother Jones senior reporter Stephanie Mencimer’s blockbuster piece that weaves together her own breast cancer diagnosis and the disturbing history of the alcohol industry downplaying the carcinogenic effects of drinking. For Bite podcast, host Kiera Butler caught up with Stephanie to talk about drinking during her teen years in Utah, how the liquor industry courts women, and why doctors still aren’t warning patients about the dangers of booze.

Mother Jones: How did you discover the link between drinking and cancer?

Stephanie Mencimer: I was diagnosed with lobular invasive carcinoma in April last year, and it came as a bit of a shock. I don’t think anyone gets cancer and thinks, “Yeah, I saw that coming.” Being a journalist, I thought, “Well, I wonder why this is happening to me.” It wasn’t because I was angry or bitter or anything, but I was just curious to know where I fit in the bigger picture. What are the risk factors for this disease that I now have? I started just Googling, of course, and I looked at all the risk factors. I went down the list, and the biggest risk factor was age. The average age of a breast cancer diagnosis is 62.

There are more than 100 studies over several decades that all come to the same conclusion that alcohol contributes to breast cancer.

That was a lot older than I was at the time. I didn’t think that was my risk factor. Taking hormone replacement therapy after menopause was also a big one, and I hadn’t hit menopause yet and had never taken those drugs. As I went through the list, there were a couple other things in there, like how early you start your period as a kid and how late you got to menopause and all that stuff. Then there was this one that really stuck out, and it was alcohol consumption.

I had no idea that alcohol was something that contributed to breast cancer. I was interested to know why I didn’t know. It wasn’t so much that I thought, “Oh, this has to be it. This is what caused my cancer.” I just wanted to know why I never found out about it until I got cancer and how is that possible. That’s what set me on the course of this research.

MJ: I think it’s really important to point out that the story that you wrote is not a health trends story. We’re so used to hearing, “Coffee is good for you. Now it’s bad for you. Eggs are bad for you. Now they’re good for you.” This is actually a case where there’s this really robust body of research over years and years that shows unequivocal results. What does the science say about the correlation between drinking and cancer right now?

SM: As you said, the science is really clear. There are more than 100 studies over [several decades] that all come to the same conclusion that alcohol contributes to breast cancer. It’s the most common cancer among women except for [skin] cancer. Alcohol contributes to about 15 percent of those [cases]. In real numbers, that’s quite a few, about 35,000 cases in a year.

There is a pretty clear biological mechanism for why alcohol is carcinogenic. It really does some pretty serious damage to the DNA in your cells, especially in places like your mouth where it can work with enzymes there to really mess up the cells and the DNA in your mouth and your esophagus. Then for breast cancer, there is a double whammy. Alcohol raises estrogen levels in the body, and estrogen weirdly enough is kind of carcinogenic. It causes the cells in your breast tissue to reproduce or replicate faster. That creates more opportunities for tumors to develop.

MJ: Your particular history of drinking got you thinking even more about this.

It was like, “Let’s mix a bunch of awful stuff from our parents’ liquor cabinets, whatever we can get ahold of, and pour it in, call it a Slurpee, and drink it with a straw.”

SM: I had my first beer when I was 13. Which is kind of weird because I grew up in Utah where people are known for not drinking. But I wasn’t Mormon, and the culture around being a non-Mormon in Utah involved lots of alcohol. The person who gave me my first beer was actually my dad. We were out pheasant hunting. I remember it really vividly, getting in the car, and it was cold outside. He was like, “Here, have a Mickey’s Big Mouth.” That was kind of the attitude that people had toward alcohol around me from a pretty young age. I can’t say that I continued to drink a lot of beer at 13, but by the time I was 15, in high school, we were drinking a lot.

Maybe everybody’s like that, but I think that we were trying as this non-Mormon group of kids to not be like the missionaries in Utah. We really pounded stuff, and it wasn’t really like the kind of social drinking that you do when you’re older. It was like, “Let’s mix a bunch of awful stuff from our parents’ liquor cabinets, whatever we can get a hold of, and pour it in, call it a Slurpee, and drink it with a straw.” That set off my years of drinking. I don’t know if I ever drank quite as much as I did when I was in high school when I was an adult. I thought about that when I got cancer and discovered that alcohol was a carcinogen and thought, “Wow, I’ve been exposed to this substance for a really long time.”

MJ: It sounds like from your piece that for women and breast cancer, that early drinking period is particularly important and particularly detrimental.

SM: Breast tissue doesn’t fully mature until a woman gets pregnant. You have a lot of cells that reproduce pretty quickly and robustly for those years, however long it is. If you never get pregnant, that in itself is a risk for breast cancer. There’s some evidence that suggests that it’s because those breast cells never mature fully, and it makes them really vulnerable to carcinogens.

Researchers had data from women who were exposed to radiation from the nuclear bomb in Nagasaki. Women who had been under the age of 20 who were exposed to radiation had way more breast cancer than women who were over 40. The researchers deduced that this was a vulnerable time for breast tissue for women. If you start drinking when you’re quite young before you’ve had children and doing a lot of it, actually, it can cause benign breast disease first, which I don’t think people really realize. Anyone who’s ever had to deal with a mammogram that involves dense breast tissue, well, alcohol can make that happen. Even though you don’t have cancer, it can still make it harder for mammograms to do their job to pick up on the tumors. It works in a whole bunch of insidious ways for younger women that I think is really powerful.

MJ: The most disturbing piece of this is that you found that the alcohol industry is actually working hard to downplay this science. Can you tell me a little more about that?

Instead of talking about the risks that come along with alcohol, they have really pushed hard to market alcohol as a health product.

SM: Instead of talking about the risks that come along with alcohol, they have really pushed hard to market alcohol as a health product, which is kind of ironic. It’s a really audacious marketing strategy to take something that kills almost 90,000 people a year, and that includes cancer but like also car crashes and accidents and things like that, to take that and say, “Hey, this is actually something you should drink every day because it’s good for you, and it might protect you from heart disease or from dementia.”

MJ: And they’ve actually tried really hard to get women into drinking more.

SM: Per capita alcohol consumption in the United States peaked in about 1981 or 1982. The industry then really got hammered because there were a lot of drunk driving tests that came along with that. Public health people pushed back and passed a bunch of laws to enforce underage drinking laws, to raise the legal drinking limit to 21. There was a lot of fetal alcohol syndrome work back then in the ’80s, and it was pretty effective so that by the mid-’90s, per capita alcohol consumption in the US had really plummeted. I think by like ’97, you can see it’s a real dip. People really just weren’t drinking as much at that point.

There’s just more of a culture of drinking, I think, for men than there was for women. The industry looked at all that and was like, “Wow, here’s a growth market.”

The industry was trying to figure out what to do about it, because they were losing money. They’re not selling as many products, and so I think that what happened is they looked at the data. Historically, women have always drunk a lot less than men. We metabolize it differently. It affects us more. There’s just more of a culture of drinking, I think, for men than there was for women. The industry looked at all that and was like, “Wow, here’s a growth market.” They set about to really push drinking on women. They came up with products for them, special types of like alcopops, sweetened malt beverages. Because women, I guess historically, don’t like the taste of beer. They created these things they marketed to young women.

It was quite a concerted effort to get women to drink more like men, and it worked. Today, [teen] girls are more likely to drink than the boys are, and that’s true of college students, too.

MJ: You have this whole part of your story where you talk about when you were diagnosed, you were sent to go meet with a nutritionist who was going to give you this anti-cancer diet.

SM: That was one of the more depressing moments of my cancer treatment, when I learned all the things that I was supposed to do to keep it from coming back. This very nice nutritionist gave me a list of things that I should do and not do; I needed a spreadsheet to really keep track of it all. I was supposed to eat cruciferous vegetables four to five times a week. I was supposed to have tofu or some sort of natural soy three times a week. She wanted me to eat 30 grams of fiber a day, which is almost impossible to do even if you’re eating a lot of lettuce because it’s a really high number, so she said, “Beans, you have to eat all these beans in order to hit that target.”

After an hour of this conversation about all the ways I should modify my diet to fight cancer, not once did she ever bring up alcohol. I talked to an oncology researcher who said, “That’s really funny because there’s a lot more data about why you shouldn’t drink alcohol than there is about eating tofu or broccoli as part of your anti-cancer diet.”

MJ: How do we compare in the United States to other countries when it comes to how much people know about this connection between alcohol and cancer?

SM: Other countries are actually doing quite a bit more than we are. One of the most interesting things I’ve found was that when the tobacco wars were really heating up, there was money that went into campaigns to do counter-advertising to combat the tobacco industry’s marketing, especially toward young people. There were ads about smoking, like the Marlboro man coughing and dying of cancer and those sorts of things, and ads that showed what smoking really did to people to make it look less sexy to counter what the tobacco industry was doing.

In England, and also in Australia, some of the cancer groups there have started doing the same thing around alcohol. They’ve run some ads where there’s a great one where they have a guy drinking a beer, and in the bottom of the glass is a tumor. It shows him sipping away at this glass, and the narrator goes on about why alcohol causes cancer, and then the guy swallows the tumor. His little kids are running around in the background.

Here in the United States, cancer groups actually join up with the alcohol industry to raise money. I found a whole bunch of places, like at Georgetown Hospital here in D.C. They have a wine and women fundraiser for their Lombardi Cancer Center. Breast cancer especially—a lot of the charities raise money through craft brew events or wine events. That’s not happening so much overseas. Other countries are doing things that will help prevent cancer by reducing alcohol consumption, like really basic stuff like raising taxes on booze, which in the United States, not only have we not raised alcohol taxes in a really long time—in the tax bill this year, they just slashed them even further. Our alcohol taxes now are lower than they were in the 1950s.

Our alcohol taxes now are lower than they were in the 1950s.

MJ: What does the science say about men’s drinking and their cancer risk?

SM: Men don’t get off the hook on this one. Alcohol for men causes more than 50 percent of all mouth and lip and throat and esophageal cancer. It causes 16 percent of all colon cancer in men, and that’s the big one because there are a lot of colon cancers. Men don’t get breast cancer like women do, and because it’s hormone related, it’s not really such an issue for them, but it’s still a problem. Esophageal cancer isn’t that common, but it’s pretty astonishing that 50 to 55 percent of all those cancers are caused by drinking. I really don’t think people appreciate that, and it’s especially true for men.

MJ: One thing that as I talk about your piece with my friends and my colleagues, we can’t shake this chilling feeling that for many of us, the damage has already been done. For me, for example, I’m 38. I had my baby right before I turned 36, at which point I had been drinking alcohol since college. Even if I quit drinking right now, would it even have any effect on my cancer risk?

SM: There is good news on that front. It’s like smoking. If you quit, your risk starts to go down. There hasn’t been as much research on this, and I imagine this would be some place that people are going to start digging into now that it’s so clear that alcohol causes cancer. Your risk will definitely go down. If you figure that things like breast cancer don’t start to show up in people a lot of times till you’re 70 years old, that gives you another 30-some years of drinking that could still give you cancer.

I don’t think that anyone is really recommending prohibition or don’t drink at all, but the government recommendations and sober scientists, they’ll say, “If you don’t drink, don’t start, but if you do drink, you should stick to the guidelines,” which say that if you have only one drink a day or less, that you’re probably going to be fine. I think that we don’t all just live to prevent cancer. I don’t want to be a total killjoy. One drink a day probably isn’t going to make your life that much shorter, but don’t have seven drinks on Saturday. I think that if people stayed within that guideline, they’d be in pretty good shape. They’d certainly be better off than they are now.

MJ: Right. One of your sources was somebody who talks to college kids about the risks of binge drinking, and she observed that she would talk to these kids, and then she would see them going out that same night and getting wasted. It seems we need to change how we’re talking to our kids about it from a much earlier age.

One of the reasons that doctors don’t like to talk about it is that doctors like to drink. There are quite a few wine companies that are owned by doctors.

SM: I think a big part of that is going to be up to the medical profession because in my experience, even going through cancer treatment—and I see my oncologist every three months—they just never talk about alcohol. Part of that is because the industry has really targeted doctors with the message that alcohol can reduce heart attacks. They distribute studies to doctors to make sure they see all that stuff about red wine, but the doctors really haven’t gotten the message that alcohol is carcinogenic.

Especially for young women, it’s such a big deal. I think that the American Society of Oncologists is trying to remedy this problem because they did a study about how few people really understand the risk of alcohol and cancer. They put out a paper saying, “Here’s all the evidence. Here’s why we need to talk to our patients about this.” They also said that one of the reasons that doctors don’t like to talk about it is that doctors like to drink. There are quite a few wine companies that are owned by doctors.

People will listen to their doctors, even if you’re a teenager or a college student. If your doctor says, “Look, this is going to give you breast cancer if you don’t cut way back,” I think that people are not stupid. They will take that into consideration and make some changes.Looking for news you can trust?

Adopting a strategy successfully employed by the tobacco industry, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced a sweeping new regulation that would restrict the kinds of scientific studies the agency can use in developing its regulations.

The EPA administrator, who has come under fire from both parties for his personal conduct and ethical scandals, announced the changes at an EPA event Tuesday, where he was surrounded by conservative allies and pollution skeptics. “I know many of you here have supported this through a number of years,” he told his audience, which did not include any reporters.

For years, EPA critics have pushed Congress to forbid the agency from relying on the studies that comprise the bulk of the independent research on fossil fuels on public health. Their strategy aims to sow doubt about the health effects of air pollution, while slowing down or weakening future rules targeting particulate matter and ozone. The proposed rule is modeled after bills introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) in the House, which Pruitt described as the “codification of an approach.”

The centerpiece proposal—restricting the EPA’s use of the best available science in crafting policy—has been tried before. The tobacco industry laid out its strategy to combat “secret science” in the EPA’s work to rein in cigarette smoke in a 1996 memo, according to The Intercept, claiming that it was impossible to know the accuracy of studies in which the researcher didn’t make all their raw data public. The fossil fuel industry later borrowed the same strategy in an attempt to undermine the landmark 1993 Harvard “Six Cities” public health study on air pollution.

Many scientists note that, in practice, the policy will prove to be unworkable. It would drastically limit the kinds of studies available to regulators crafting the agency’s air and water regulations, because many of these studies rely on sensitive medical records that cannot be made public, or may be owned by private institutions not keen on publishing proprietary information.

“The irony is whenever the industry does these studies from their own angle, do they reveal all the data? No. It becomes this very disingenuous cry of someone playing dirty.”

The EPA’s critics “are forever trying to cut this data and saying the broad scientific community aren’t giving them all the information they need to disprove this data,” says Dan Costa, former director of the EPA’s Air, Climate, and Energy Research Program, who recently retired. “The irony is whenever the industry does these studies from their own angle, do they reveal all the data? No. It becomes this very disingenuous cry of someone playing dirty.”

According to emails obtained by the Union of Concerned Scientists through FOIA requests, Nancy Beck, a top political appointee at the agency, had noted her concern about this approach in January to Richard Yamada, the top political appointee in the Office of Research and Development. She suggested that industry studies also would be affected by the changes. “Such a requirement would be incredibly burdensome,” she wrote, “not practical.”

The proposed rule that will be published in the Federal Register appears to get around this obstacle for industry studies by granting Pruitt the power to personally decide what exemptions can be made. The generous carveout allows the “Administrator to exempt significant regulatory decisions on a case-by-case basis if he or she determines that compliance is impracticable because it is not feasible…”

Once implemented, the rule would have a far-reaching impact on the agency’s future policymaking and its rules on lead in drinking water and air pollution. For example, the agency is due to review regulations on particulate matter small enough to lodge into the lungs and cause serious health problems. “This is very transparently a way to attack the ozone and particulate matter standards,” Gretchen Goldman, lead analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists says. “It’s written very prescriptively, focused on getting down to the inconvenient studies for those being regulated.” Every five years the EPA is supposed to assess the best available science on ozone and particulate matter and decide action from there, but with this policy in place, the work would either be slowed down to a crawl as researchers try to obtain the raw data, or it would end up being based on a skewed sample of studies.

For the “Secret Science Reform” bill introduced by Rep. Smith in 2014, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the implementation costs would be $250 million a year—half of the Office of Research and Development’s research budget. Though the EPA proposal is not as far-reaching, applying to economically significant regulations only, it is still burdensome for a cash-strapped agency. The CBO report estimated the cost would go up $10,000 to $30,000 for each study the agency uses; one way it suggests reducing costs is for the EPA to rely on “significantly fewer studies each year in support of its mission.”

The most effective way Pruitt can hollow out the EPA, besides gutting its staff, is to attack the heart of how the agency uses and studies science—the bedrock of the EPA’s work. And he’s taken aim at science in other ways, as he highlighted in Tuesday’s speech, such as changing the composition of the agency’s independent science advisory boards. He claimed that he was removing advisers because they had a “conflict of interest” because they received EPA grants. But by removing them, he paved the way for more industry-sympathetic views on the boards that are designed to serve as an independent check on the agency’s science.

Tuesday’s move advances that goal. Joseph Goffman, a former EPA attorney who is now director of the Harvard Environmental Law program, told me he was especially struck by “how transparent Pruitt is about rigging the process: Rigging the membership of the science boards, rigging the range of studies that will be incorporated in agency decision-making. And in both cases [he’s] excluding sources of information or expertise that would lead to outcomes that Pruitt doesn’t prefer.”

Goffman thinks Pruitt’s predecessors never went as far as Pruitt to change the agency’s internal processes to suit their political purposes. “He’s changing the internal rules of the game by which [the] EPA plays in order to rig it.”Looking for news you can trust?

While the United States effectively banned lead-based paint in 1978, in many developing countries—even after decades of research showing how lead is linked to learning disabilities, lower IQ, and other health effects in children—the element is still abundantly applied in paint products, with lead concentrations sometimes up to 100 times higher than what’s permitted in the US.

The Philippines had long been a prime example of this. Just ten years ago, local activist Manny Calonzo decided to test the paint in his home country—the first person to publicly do so. Calonzo had long been involved in consumer safety, working for Consumers International in Penang, Malaysia, in the late 90s. After he returned to his home country, in 2008, he became president of pollution watchdog EcoWaste Coalition, a network of more than 150 environmental groups based in Quezon City.

If you do a Google search for lead paint or lead exposure, so many articles will pop up relating to problems in the US. We do not want that to happen in our country.

Alarmingly, Calonzo found that most of the paint he tested contained lead levels above the allowable US limit, 90 parts per million (ppm), with more than 40 percent of the paint measuring levels over 10,000 ppm. This shocked Calonzo, a grandparent of 12. For years following the discovery, he used scientific evidence to advocate for the phase-out of lead paint in his country and organized more than 100 events to draw attention to the issue. Five years later, the government finally listened.

In December 2013, the Department of the Environment and National Resources secretary signed a Chemical Control Order, which limited lead to 90 ppm, and aimed to eliminate household lead-based paint over the course of three years. By January of last year, 85 percent of the paint market in the Philippines was certified as safe.

Calonzo is credited with protecting the lives of millions of Filipino children. On Monday, Calonzo will be granted the Goldman Environmental Prize, commonly called the “Oscars” of the field, along with six other global winners—including LeeAnne Walters, who exposed the Flint water crisis in Michigan.

A few days before the awards, I sat down with Calonzo in San Francisco to talk about his work with EcoWaste Coalition, how he hopes to inspire a new generation of environmentalists, and one very memorable Christmas.

Mother Jones: Before we talk about your work, I’m interested what it was it like growing up in Makati [the country’s financial center, in Manila]. What did your parents do?

Manny Calonzo: I come from a typical Filipino family. My father used to be a government employee before he passed away in 2006, and my mother is a home manager. I have five other siblings.

MJ: Has being a grandparent shaped your experience as an activist?

MC: Before I got involved in this advocacy in the Philippines, we had encountered toys containing toxic metals, such as lead, cadmium, and mercury, above the allowable limits. And that was really scary.

MJ: Do you remember any specific products that your grandchildren played with that you later found out might be contaminated?

When we received the results, we were really shocked because high levels of lead were detected in most of the samples.

MC: The most recent was a chair and table set given by McDonalds to children celebrating their birthdays in their restaurants. One of my grandchildren was given a complimentary set. I was curious because the furniture was brightly colored, so I brought them to the office, and using our X-Ray Fluorescence analyzer, we detected high concentrations of lead, more than 50,000 ppm on the yellow-coated metal frames, way above the threshold limit of 90 ppm. So, just to be sure, we sent the chair to the lab for analysis, and it was confirmed. We reported it to McDonalds and they took immediate action.

MJ: Tell me a little about your research process. How did it all begin?

MC: Our first foray into this research was in 2008. The EcoWaste Coalition participated in a study organized by Toxics Link, an NGO based in Delhi, India, in collaboration with IPEN, an international NGO network promoting safer chemicals policies and practices. We bought paint samples in Manila and shipped the entire cans to India for analysis in a government-accredited laboratory.

When we received the results, we were really shocked because high levels of lead were detected in most of the samples. Follow-up studies conducted in 2013 and 2015 also confirmed the prevalence of highly-leaded paints in the local market. The last study we conducted was in 2017 and we saw some progress.

MJ: What kind of progress?

MC: Based on the study we conducted in 2017, 77 percent of the 104 paint samples analyzed pass the 90 ppm lead paint limit. The remaining 23 percent are still non-compliant, suggesting the need for further compliance monitoring—but that was remarkable progress from the previous studies.

MJ: It seems like the Philippine government was very receptive to your advocacy. What’s your “secret sauce”?

MC: I think our painstaking efforts to reach out to stakeholders from the government, industry, and other sectors is a key factor. Without that bridge-building, it would be difficult to get listened to, especially on matters that are quite technical.

It was also very important that our relationship with the paint industry association and their affiliates was very constructive. We didn’t have to deal with any corporate “mafia” of sorts. It was a mutually respectful relationship. There was even a point in time where we got invited in their board meetings to present our views and make recommendations.

We thought it was the best Christmas gift ever that the government could give to the Filipino children.

MJ: Were the paint companies aware of the lead in their paint?

MC: Of course they knew, because lead is intentionally added, but in terms of overall impact to society—particularly to children’s health—maybe that was not as well understood before our campaign was initiated.

MJ: When that legislation did go through [in 2013], what did that feel like?

MC: Actually, there’s a small story behind that. It was signed on December 23, 2013, before Christmas, which is a big thing in the Philippines. I was actually at the gate of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, waiting for the big news, just to be sure I could text-blast my colleagues. We thought it was the best Christmas gift ever that the government could give to the Filipino children.

MJ: Even with legislation, there’s still the issue of houses that have paint on the walls, which is something we’re seeing in the US, in mostly low-income neighborhoods. How do you plan on addressing that problem in the Philippines?

MC: Thank you for asking that. When we were pushing for the phase-out of lead-containing paints in the Philippines, one of the arguments that we forcefully put forward is the fact that by acting now, we avoid a problem that is more complicated and costly to address. Often times, we cite the US experience. If you do a Google search for lead paint or lead exposure, so many articles will pop up relating to problems in the US. We do not want that to happen in our country. I understand that in the United States, about eight to 15 US dollars are needed per square foot, or about 10,000 US dollars are needed to safely remove lead in a typical US house. That’s a lot of money. And developing countries can’t afford that, so it makes sense that we act fast and prevent childhood lead exposure by phasing out lead paint now.

MJ: Speaking of the future, is there anyone in your family who you’ve inspired to work on this kind of advocacy?

MC: One of my grandchildren, his name is Aedan. He’s nine years old. He has good grades on math and science, and he knows the word “toxic.” He knows that some toys can be hazardous for him if they contain lead, so I am hoping I can cultivate his curiosity to become someone who can help in safeguarding his generation against toxic pollution.

MJ: That reminds me—I saw that EcoWaste has done outreach to schools to teach kids about lead paint. What is the goal there?

MC: I think it is important for young children to get informed about the issue at an early age because they’re the ones affected most by lead exposure. And, it is not uncommon in the Philippines for young children, when they get back home, to share news and stories to their parents and to their siblings. We’re hoping a kind of multiplier effect will happen.

MJ: I know you’re being awarded the Goldman Prize for your work on lead-based paints, but you and EcoWaste work on a lot of different environmental issues. Is there one global environmental issue that you think isn’t getting enough attention?

MC: I think chemical safety in general doesn’t rank that high in the list of priorities of governments and other sectors. I think there is a need to elevate the issue of toxic chemical pollution to a higher level because it is a common threat to people’s health and well-being, even to babies who are still growing in the womb.

You have studies in the US showing that babies are born pre-polluted with highly hazardous chemicals. Even breast milk is also affected by these pollutants. I think more resources should be provided to efforts at the global, national, regional, and local levels to promote and ensure a toxics-free future for all.

Album Review

Kate Nash

Yesterday Was Forever

Girl Gang

Britain’s Kate Nash is a real live wire. Her enticing pop songs feature elegant melodies, ultra-catchy choruses and insistent vocals that mix poise and anxiety to striking effect, not unlike the best of Lily Allen (an early Nash supporter). Her excellent fourth outing, the fizzy Yesterday Was Forever, explores depression and volatile relationships with bracing directness. “Life in Pink” opens the album with the declaration, “I think about death all the time,” going on to say, “I wish I could take you to another time / When everything was cool and my mental health was fine.” On “Today” she calmly notes, “Maybe today when I go out it will feel different / And I won’t feel scared at all,” adding, “I don’t wanna always have to try.” However dark the sentiments, the raw energy Nash brings to her tales of struggle adds a triumphant undertone, suggesting everything will eventually turn out okay.Looking for news you can trust?

A quick YouTube search for Clemantine Wamariya will bring a clip of her 2006 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Wamariya, then in high school, had won an essay contest about Elie Wiesel’s book Night and was invited onto the show with other winners. She could relate to Wiesel’s experiences in the Nazi death camps, having fled her hometown of Kigali, Rwanda, in the wake of the 1994 genocide. Wamariya and her sister Claire ultimately took refuge in the United States, and although they knew their parents had survived the massacres back home, they hadn’t seen them in more than 12 years.

Winfrey invited the girls onto her show, where she stunned them by bringing their estranged parents and siblings out on stage. The family members enveloped each other in joyful hugs. Wamariya crumbled to the floor in tearful elation. “That’s a moment that will be with me forever,” Winfrey says in the clip. “It’s just beautiful, raw, raw, raw. Pure.” But that moment only offered an introduction to Wamariya’s saga. “Oprah could get someone to listen,” says Wamariya, now 30. “But I needed to continue the story.”

We’re sitting on a small hill in San Francisco’s Lafayette Park on a bright Thursday morning, just blocks from the apartment building where Wamariya now lives. Our perch offers a view of a playground where parents play with their youngsters. We’re joined by Elizabeth Weil, a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine and co-writer of Wamariya’s engrossing new memoir The Girl Who Smiled Beads, which comes out this week.

“I really wanted to go back to the roots of me—of me choosing me.”

Wamariya, dressed in jeans and a white blouse, had brought delightful soft drinks—passion fruit with seltzer and mint in small mason jars, each kept cool with a large ice cube. This is the same spot where Wamariya and Weil met for countless hours during the writing process. Their book chronicles the sisters’ travails as they make their way across Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and South Africa, and Wamariya’s subsequent experiences as a refugee in the US. It’s a visceral and gripping account of what it’s like to try and pull yourself up—to make a decent life for yourself—while wrestling with profound emotional trauma.

“I really wanted to go back to the roots of me—of me choosing me,” Wamariya says. “I felt like I was being pulled so many directions, and I just wanted to bring myself in one place. I wanted to have a narrative that was for me.”

She credits Weil for helping to excavate her memories, which at times felt chaotic and disorganized: “One of the things I think Liz did so well was to be able to pull out places that I didn’t want to go.” The process took almost four years, with Weil helping Wamariya reflect on her experiences with family members and pivotal moments in her life.

The way Wamariya unpacks her story and interrogates how she wants to tell it to others is one of the book’s most captivating aspects. She writes, for instance, that when she started reading Wiesel’s memoir, she “wanted to consume it whole.” Until then, she had been unfamiliar with the word “genocide” and unable to talk about her horrific experiences with family members. “When I read Night I was like, [Gasps], ‘He’s saying that? I can say that?’ I thought that was so shameful,” she recalls. “I found words to be able to communicate what I felt.” Wiesel’s willingness to lay bare his own feelings of darkness and shame gave her courage to do the same.

“I did not want to be a tool or case study,” she writes. “I did not want to be that Rwandan girl.”

That’s part of the reason Wamariya is so unwaveringly honest about the details of her life—recounting how her toenails fell off after she had walked hundreds of miles, and how she and most of her fellow refugees were infected with lice in one of the camps. But surviving didn’t exactly make her a saint. Safe in the United States, she distanced herself from her parents, who seemed like strangers to her after so many years apart. And she was often offended when people asked about her time in Rwanda. “I did not want to be a tool or case study,” she writes. “I did not want to be that Rwandan girl.”

Even as she hops from one success to another—attending an elite private school, getting into Yale, being appointed to the board of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum by President Barack Obama, the Oprah invite, this book—she remains overwhelmed by her emotions, and still struggles to connect with her parents. “I think when you survive any intense experience people try to moralize you, a lot of people just try to raise you high, and it’s so not fair to you and to everybody else,” Wamariya says. “I’m hoping that whoever reads [the book] from Rwanda and Burundi, from all the places that I mentioned, I hope that everybody just goes like, ‘Oh goodness! She’s saying that out loud.’ And some people might say, ‘How dare she!’ and there are people who will say, ‘Oh goodness, I can say this,’” she continues. “All I want is whispers in Rwanda. I don’t even need a conversation.”

Wamariya is adamant that she doesn’t believe in letting labels like “refugee” define her. And she hopes that sharing her experiences will help others who have experienced trauma. “I hope that it gives people ownership of their human being, the ownership of their breath, their heartbeat, their body,” she says. “I want people to know that they are the masters, the queens, kings, and gods of their own story.”Looking for news you can trust?

If you’re making a salad to go along with your dinner tonight, you should probably thank the farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley, who produce about two-thirds of the country’s lettuce and much of its strawberries, tomatoes, and broccoli. When they head home to meet their families this evening, many of them won’t have the space to cook their own meals: A long-standing housing crisis has likely pushed tens of thousands of farmworkers into cramped and dangerous living conditions without adequate access to kitchens and bathrooms, according to a housing survey released Thursday by the California Institute for Rural Studies (CIRS) and the California Coalition for Rural Housing.

Surveyors found about 40 people lodged into a three-bedroom home with just two bathrooms.

Some farmworkers sleep in cars, motels, garages, converted school buses, and reportedly even chicken coops—which helps explain why 1 in 3 students in the Salinas school district are technically homeless. Many more share apartments with strangers, sometimes dozens of them, leading to public health concerns. The poor conditions have deterred some families from moving to the area or staying there, contributing to a worker shortage that has affected the ag industry’s bottom line.

Housing prices have skyrocketed in much of California in recent years, and the situation is dire for many of the 90,000 farmworkers in Salinas and neighboring Pajaro Valley, about 100 miles south of San Francisco. According to the survey of 420 workers, they earn an average of $25,000 a year per household, though a typical two-bedroom apartment in Salinas rents for $1,600 a month. Only 1 in 10 of them own a home or mobile home, and the rest rent, sometimes cutting back on food or medical care to cover housing costs. On average, more than seven people share a one-bedroom unit—though some apartments are more crammed: In one case, 40 people were lodged into a three-bedroom home with just two bathrooms, according to Ildi Cummins-Carlisle, a survey coordinator at CIRS.

And these aren’t all single migrant men. The survey found that most of the farmworkers are married immigrants who came from Mexico more than a decade ago and now live year-round in the region with their US-born children. Some parents teared up while describing their kids’ living conditions, like a father who worried about whether his daughters could safely use their home’s bathroom at night with dozens of strangers sleeping in the hallway and the living room. Kids sometimes have to wait so long for the bathroom they develop urinary tract infections, and when they get hungry, it’s often not possible to cook. One in five respondents of the survey didn’t have a kitchen.

Kids sometimes have to wait so long for the bathroom they develop urinary tract infections.

The worsening housing crisis comes amid a labor shortage in the world’s “salad bowl.” Farmers have struggled to recruit enough workers in part because of the federal crackdown on immigrants, as my colleague Tom Philpott has reported, and the lack of affordable and sanitary housing has exacerbated the situation, according to the researchers. “They can’t get people to move here, or stay here, because there’s nowhere for them to live,” says Cummins-Carlisle.

Millions of dollars worth of lettuce crops rotted in the fields a few years ago when Tanimura & Antle, a vegetable producer in Salinas, only managed to recruit about 200 of the 500 farmworkers it needed, so the company decided to build more designated housing for its employees. The $17 million complex opened in 2016, and after that the vegetable producer was able to fully staff its team. But the housing complex isn’t a cure-all—it’s only for employees, not kids, and many more rooms are needed. Although other ag families are working to build more housing for workers, the surveyors note that about 48,000 additional units of farmworker housing are needed to alleviate overcrowding. Subsidized, permanent housing will be key: There are currently only 1,207 year-round units in designated farmworker complexes in the region, far short of the 6,351 such units recommended.

On Thursday, government officials from Santa Cruz and Monterey counties met in the city of Salinas to discuss the problem with the researchers along with agriculture company representatives. “It was alarming to hear the statistics of the number of families living in overcrowded situations,” Mayor Maria Orozco of the city of Gonzales tells Mother Jones. She said city officials plan to talk with companies and nonprofits about how to follow Tanimura & Antle’s lead with the development of new housing, and to review city regulations in an attempt to streamline the process of building more units.

She hopes the high turnout at the summit in Salinas signals a shift in momentum to tackle the shortage of affordable rooms. “This is the first time I can remember seeing this issue at the forefront,” she says. “How that turns out, I don’t know,” adds Gail Wadsworth of the CIRS. “But there definitely was a commitment there.”Looking for news you can trust?

James Shaw Jr., the 29-year-old being hailed as a hero after wrestling a rifle away from a gunman who opened fire inside a Nashville Waffle House Sunday, has launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for the shooting victims and their families.

Shaw’s effort has so far raised nearly $25,000—far surpassing his original goal of $15,000. Dozens of donors who contributed to the page left messages expressing their gratitude for Shaw’s actions, which law enforcement officials say likely saved numerous lives.

“Heartbroken for those who lost their lives to more gun violence, but so proud of James Shaw Jr.,” Laurie George, a donor, wrote on the page Monday. “A fine, brave young man.”

Shaw has repeatedly declined to call himself a hero, instead describing his decision to attack the suspected gunman and grab his AR-15 rifle as an ordinary act.

“I’m not a hero,” Shaw said at a Sunday news conference. “I’m just a regular person. I think anybody could have did what I did if they’re pushed. You have to either react or fall. I chose to react because I didn’t see any other way to live.”

“I hope we can bring violence in all facets—not just gun violence, but all facets of violence—to an end,” he said in a another interview.

The early Sunday morning shooting killed four people and injured four others. The suspected gunman remains at large.

On a clear day in the summer of 2016, an ambulance arrived at the Yale New Haven Hospital carrying a man in his 60s with the classic signs of an opioid overdose: His breathing had stopped, his heart had slowed, and his blood pressure had dropped. Over the next six hours, 11 more people were admitted with similar symptoms, three of whom died. At first, the cause of the overdose cluster appeared to be the usual: Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, had probably made its way into a batch of heroin.

But subsequent drug tests and interviews with those who survived revealed a more complicated answer: The admitted patients thought they were using cocaine. What they snorted, however, turned out to be fentanyl with trace amounts of cocaine. Fentanyl can be deadly for regular opioid users, but for people who hadn’t built up a tolerance, the amount of fentanyl in the cocaine was “staggering,” said Dr. Anthony Tomassoni, an emergency medicine professor at Yale University who wrote about the case for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Yet, alongside deaths involving fentanyl-laced heroin, overdoses involving cocaine and fentanyl—without the heroin—are quietly rising. Many medical examiner’s offices don’t specify the exact drug combinations found in the bodies of overdose victims, but data compiled by Mother Jones found an increase in cocaine-fentanyl deaths in four places that track these specifics: Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York City, and Cuyahoga County in Ohio.

Cuyahoga County experienced a particularly big jump—medical examiner Dr. Thomas Gilson has called the influx of fentanyl a “tidal wave.” In 2016 and 2017, deaths involving cocaine and fentanyl without heroin made up about a quarter of the county’s total overdoses. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York City saw similar, though markedly less extreme, patterns. The rise prompted New York City to issue a public health advisory last summer. “Anyone using drugs, even casually, is at risk,” reads a health department flyer, which urges users to “use with someone else,” “take turns using,” and “use a small amount first to see how strong your drugs are.”

It’s challenging to tell what’s driving the increase in cocaine-fentanyl deaths, as an autopsy can’t determine the timing and intention of drug use. Perhaps the victim intentionally used both cocaine and opioids—a combination known as a “speedball”—or perhaps they sought out cocaine without realizing it was laced with fentanyl.

But available supply data indicates that cocaine is increasingly mixed with fentanyl before it’s ingested. In Cuyahoga County, law enforcement seizures of cocaine-fentanyl mixes increased 43-fold between 2015 and 2017. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported that 7 percent of seized cocaine contained fentanyl in 2017, up from 4 percent the previous year, according to NPR.

Theories abound in the public health world as to why cocaine would be laced with such a fatal drug. One is simply that drug use overall is up, and with that has come some unintentional contamination: “There’s more cocaine, and there’s more fentanyl, so there’s going to be more cocaine-fentanyl,” says Boston Medical Center epidemiologist Dr. Traci Green.

But given the scope of the trend, some are beginning to think that contaminating cocaine with fentanyl could be a calculated strategy of cartels and drug dealers to hook cocaine users on opioids. “It seems like a funny way to go about it, but once people use fentanyl as much as a couple times in a week, they’re very likely going to want more,” says Tomassoni, the Yale emergency medicine professor. “The very first dose of an opioid has been demonstrated to begin to change your brain chemistry. If you try it and you like it, you’ll do it again.”



Health experts are particularly worried about the impact of fentanyl-laced cocaine on the black community. Though the opioid epidemic is typically framed as a white problem, African American overdose deaths have climbed dramatically in recent years, driven largely by the influx of fentanyl into the drug supply. In Cleveland, “the African American community has been less affected by the heroin and opioid crisis—until this strategy was implemented of introducing fentanyl into the cocaine supply,” says Hugh Shannon, administrator of the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office. In 2017, 99 African Americans in Cuyahoga County died of overdoses involving fentanyl—up from seven in 2014. The majority of the deaths involved fentanyl and cocaine. Similarly, in Connecticut last year, African Americans made up 15 percent of the cocaine-fentanyl deaths, compared to 8 percent of overall overdose deaths.

As part of her research, Green, of Boston Medical Center, examines the death scenes of those who overdosed on cocaine and fentanyl in Rhode Island and speaks to those close to the victims. She’s trying to figure out what exactly happened: Did the victims intend to use opioids? Did they mean to mix the drugs? Her conclusion, after dozens of interviews: “Whether it was intentional or unintentional, contaminated or cut, what I know for sure is that these people who died were definitely not expecting fentanyl in their system.”

On Thursday night, the Justice Department sent Congress the declassified and redacted version of James Comey’s famous memos, in which the then-FBI director memorialized his conversations with Donald Trump in the months leading up to his unceremonious firing by the president. The documents were quickly leaked to the press, and Trump soon took to Twitter to simultaneously denounce Comey and maintain that the memos vindicate him and his campaign. (They don’t. In his memos, Comey notes that allegations in the Steele dossier had been corroborated by other intelligence sources.)

James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018

In Comey’s memos, he recounted an exchange with Trump in which the president questioned Michael Flynn’s judgement. But on Friday morning Trump tweeted sympathetically about his former national security adviser, who was fired last year for allegedly misleading Vice President Mike Pence and has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about those conversations. Trump also trashed Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty.

So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018

This is just the latest in a series of tweets attacking Comey, who’s on a media tour promoting his new book. Earlier this week, Trump once again suggested the former FBI director should be prosecuted.Looking for news you can trust?

How are things going down on the Southwest border? Not so good according to the Border Patrol: “During the month of March CBP saw a 37 percent increase overall when compared to February, but a 203 percent increase compared to March 2017.”

Yikes! But how are things really going? Illegal immigration is seasonal, so let’s take a look at border apprehensions in winter:

Even if you use the average for all of winter, apprehensions are up 50 percent compared to last year. However, over the past few years illegal border crossings have been only mildly seasonal, so it might be more helpful to zoom in on all monthly totals for the past few years:

A moderate drop in January followed by a rebound in February isn’t unusual, but in 2017 we got an enormous drop from January all the way through April, bringing border apprehension levels to historic lows. This is something I thought might happen: there are a few areas where pure bluster can accomplish something, and this is one of them. After Trump was elected, it’s quite possible that his loud talk, followed up by some showy raids after he took office, scared a lot of potential border crossers away:

This is a case where fear works. But will it work for long? The problem with amping up the bluster is that eventually it becomes the new normal and no longer has much effect. By that time, you really need to have an effective policy in place, and it’s not yet clear if Trump has the attention span or political skills to make that happen. We’ll see.

To give him his due, I’d say that Trump’s attention span has been fine on this issue. He keeps hammering away at it. But he hasn’t been very effective at putting together actual policies to keep illegal immigration levels low, even though Democrats have offered him some pretty good deals. But that’s our negotiator-in-chief for you. He’s spent 30 years screwing up every deal he got his hands on, and now he has an even bigger canvas to screw up on.Looking for news you can trust?

Paul Morse explains how he got that viral picture of all the presidents and first ladies:

It all kind of naturally came together. All of the characters were there except President Clinton, who was talking to someone. He was the last one who joined the picture and he kind of scooted in there, which is why he’s partially obscured by Mrs. Clinton.

Of course he was. Never change, Bill.Looking for news you can trust?

Perusing my LA Times this morning, Michael Hiltzik brings me up to speed on the latest GOP plan for paid family leave:

The idea of government-sponsored paid family leave is gaining popularity at the state level and in Washington, where Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ivanka Trump are “strategizing” to bring more Republicans into the fold….It’s a good idea that would finally bring the United States into line with every other high-income nation on Earth, as a recent analysis by the Urban Institute points out. But the Urban Institute also observes that the Rubio-Trump idea for financing the program through Social Security is a terrible idea.

Wait. Social Security? What does that have to do with paid family leave? Here’s a previous Hiltzik column on the genesis of this proposal from Kristin Shapiro and Andrew Biggs:

Shapiro and Biggs propose offering mothers and fathers the equivalent of Social Security disability for up to 12 weeks of leave….But unlike traditional Social Security disability coverage, the recipients would be required to pay the money back by delaying their Social Security retirement benefits.

Details aside, let’s call this what it is: a loan. The Trubio plan basically offers new parents a 12-week loan that they have to pay back later. So why bring Social Security into this at all? Why not just handle it like student loans, with new parents getting a bank loan guaranteed by the federal government and repayment delayed for, say, ten years? Banks would love the guaranteed profits. It’s true that parental leave loans would be less lucrative than student loans since they’re only for 12 weeks, but maybe payday lenders could get into the act. That would make it a twofer for Republicans.

It would also make it clear to recipients what they’re getting themselves into. “Delayed retirement” 40 years in the future seems pretty fuzzy to most people. A loan that has to be paid back in a decade is a lot more concrete. And at least it would be cheaper than the Trubio version. The Urban Institute, using their fabulous DYNASIM model, recently calculated an estimate of benefits vs. repayments for the Trubio plan, and it looked like this:

On the bright side, the Trubio plan turns out to be fairly progressive since it inherits the progressiveness of Social Security payments and benefits. On the not-so-bright side, everyone with kids has a big loan to be paid off when they retire. This does not strike me as an especially family-friendly policy.Looking for news you can trust?

Debi Cornwall’s Welcome to Camp America: Inside Guantánamo Bay (Radius Books) is an exhaustively researched, exceptionally photographed documentation of one the most heavily guarded prisons in the world. The way in which photographs, interviews, and government documents intersect and overlap in a multifaceted layout makes the physical book itself becomes important to the narrative. As Cornwall says, the fold-over pages and other layout elements invite the reader to either “take what is given or choose to dig a little deeper.” It’s rare to find a photobook in which the book doesn’t just act as an outlet, but actually amplifies the power of the work within.

It’s no surprise that access at Guantánamo proved to be restrictive, even for Cornwall, who was first granted access in 2014 after a nine month clearance process. What can and can’t be photographed on the base is highly controlled. When shooting film, she had to develop the work on base, under control of military censors. Working within those confines, Cornwall’s work focuses on life and the every day elements at Gitmo—for US military personnel and, as much as possible, for detainees. Most of her photos, though, are hauntingly empty—empty cells, empty restaurants, empty golf courses. Operational security largely prevents the inclusion of people in photos. In the rare instance people appear, their back is to the camera.

Against this barren backdrop, Cornwall drops in still life photos of items available for purchase at the Gitmo gift shop. You can buy a bobblehead Fidel Castro ($20), a Camp X-Ray coffee mug ($7.99), plush rasta iguana ($4.99), I LOVE Gitmo lip balm (price not available). It’s easy to laugh when you’re on this side of the fence. But not all the still life images portray such a queasy playfulness. Cornwall also photographed items not available at the gift shop: shackles used to restrain detainees ($142.50), detainee-issue shoes ($8.59/pair), shirts ($21.95), and trousers ($26.95). It’s surreal mix of images, made only more disorienting by the inclusion of the government documents—partially redacted, naturally.

What makes Camp America different from other photo projects on Guantánamo Bay—like Louie Palu’s excellent Guantánamo, Paolo Pellegrin’s multimedia piece of the same name, or Christopher Sims’ project from 2009—is the inclusion of 14 inserts containing portraits of former detainees who have been released. Like the few soldiers who appear in the book, the detainees are photographed with their backs to the camera, faceless. But unlike the US soldiers we see in the book, these men are not completely anonymous. The inserts include basic information: where they’re from, their current occupation, where they’re photographed, how long they were held, when and where they were released, and the charges filed (if any). This humanizing aspect of the book, buffeted by pieces of interviews with detainees dropped in throughout the book, make it so much more than a quirky look at a secretive, tropical military base. Cornwall plunges you just a little into the utter madness of Guantánamo.

“Guantánamo Bay’s detention centers have now been open for more than fifteen years,” writes Cornwall in an essay in the book, which is heavily and powerfully influenced by her past as a civil rights lawyer focused on wrongful convictions. “Of the 780 men who have been held there, only eight have been convicted in the military commissions, and five of those convictions were overturned on appeal. Nine captives have died. Hundreds have been cleared and released, returning home or, if U.S. authorities deemed it necessary, transferred to third countries pursuant to secret agreements between governments. As of this writing, 61 men remain in custody.”

The book also includes essays from the president of the International Center of Photography, Fred Ritchin, and from a former Guantánamo detainee named Moazzam Begg. All text in the book is printed in both English and Arabic—an important nod to the book’s audience beyond the usual English-speaking crowd. All these elements push this book past a mere photobook. It’s an important documentation of an awful period in America’s history, one that, it should be noted, is ongoing.

“Placing ‘War on Terror’ captives,” Cornwall writes, “on an offshore military base has on one level been a great success: out of sight, out of mind. Over the last fifteen years, most Americans have stopped looking.”

About a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Scott Pruitt arrived at the Environmental Protection Agency for his first full day of work. The new administrator had weathered a contentious confirmation battle, with bitter debate over his long-standing ties to the industries he was now responsible for regulating—not to mention the 14 lawsuits he had filed against the agency as Oklahoma’s attorney general. But as he stepped into the EPA’s stately Rachel Carson Green Room, Pruitt wore the satisfied grin of a man in charge.

He took the stage with Catherine McCabe, the acting head of the agency. In the front rows sat some members of the EPA’s “beachhead team,” a group of mostly men whom Trump had installed to begin the process of dismantling the department of the Obama years. Among them were some familiar faces, such as David Schnare, a former career EPA official and prominent climate-science skeptic. A conspicuous number of security staffers circulated among the crowd.

McCabe handed Pruitt two gifts. One was a beige baseball hat inscribed with the EPA’s logo—a nod to Pruitt’s career as a college second baseman and a minor league co-owner. The other was an EPA pin, which she advised he should “proudly wear…on your lapel as you represent the agency.” Pruitt considered the pin for a moment and then set it on the podium. He appeared uncomfortable sharing the spotlight; as he stood next to McCabe, I saw him fidgeting with his glasses, his eyes shifting between her and the audience while she read a version of his biography that omitted the lawsuits.

Half a head shorter than many members of Trump’s Cabinet, a bit stocky, and balding on top, Pruitt didn’t visibly command the space. But once McCabe stepped aside, he relaxed as cameras broadcast his address to 15,000 EPA staffers nationwide. “I am excited about being in a city that actually has a Major League Baseball team,” he said, using his new hat as a prop. The speech was light on the environment and the agency’s mission and heavy on where the Obama administration had gone wrong. He covered talking points that he would repeat ceaselessly during the next few months: “Regulations ought to make things regular”; it was time to be “pro-energy and -jobs”; “process matters”; he would “listen, learn, and lead.” When it was over, Trump’s men enthusiastically pumped his hand while career staffers silently filed out the back.

It was not quite the fire and brimstone of his boss, but Pruitt’s quieter style masks the extent to which his approach to governing is the practical implementation of the president’s wrecking-ball rhetoric. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to “get rid” of the EPA “in almost every form.” In just his first year in office, Pruitt has already made stunning strides in that direction. He’s dismantling the Obama administration’s landmark Clean Power Plan, which imposed greenhouse gas limits on fossil-fuel-fired power plants. He has slashed enforcement efforts against polluters and tried to repeal rules meant to safeguard drinking-water supplies. He has threatened to roll back fuel economy standards. He’s moved to weaken new rules for smog, coal ash, and mercury pollution, poorly enforced a new toxic-chemical law, and refused to ban the dangerous pesticide chlorpyrifos. He’s taken aim at dozens of lesser-known rules covering everything from safety requirements for replacing asbestos to emergency response plans in hazardous chemical facilities. In the process, Pruitt has driven away hundreds of experienced EPA staffers and scientists while putting old friends and industry reps in charge of key environmental decisions—a troubling trend that has led former EPA administrators from both parties to warn that he is doing irreversible damage to the agency.

For the president, Pruitt has become a trusted partner. “We’ve been through our battles, Scott,” Trump said a few weeks after sharing his Rose Garden podium with Pruitt as they announced plans to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement. “Not with each other, with the world.”

Thanks to his habit of tenting his fingers, Pruitt has prompted comparisons to C. Montgomery Burns, the villainous nuclear power plant owner in The Simpsons. And indeed, Pruitt has been almost cartoonishly contemptuous of the EPA’s work, pushing draconian cuts to the agency’s science, climate, regulatory, and enforcement offices. Meanwhile, in just his first year, he has reportedly expanded his around-the-clock security detail at a cost of at least $2 million annually. He spent $25,000 on a secure phone booth inside his office, at least $12,000 for flights around the country between March and May (each of which included a leg in Tulsa), $58,000 on chartered and military flights over the summer, and nearly $40,000 on a trip to Morocco to promote natural gas exports. His frequent first-class trips with his security detail have added more than $200,000 to that tally. He also issued a $120,000 no-bid contract to a Republican opposition research firm to target and track journalists, though the contract was canceled after I exposed it.

Like Trump, Pruitt has engaged in a continuous battle against the press. Within weeks of his arrival, the EPA’s public affairs office stopped responding to many reporters’ questions and sharing his complete schedule. Instead, the agency has mostly focused on spreading its message through the right-wing media, talking frequently to Fox News and conservative radio hosts while dismissing less favorable coverage as fake. The EPA’s social-media accounts spent the first months of Pruitt’s tenure blasting out photos of him fist-bumping EPA staffers and meeting with politicians. In the Obama years, the EPA tweeted about the agency’s programs and environmental issues. During Pruitt’s first three weeks in office, 90 percent of the agency’s tweets were about him.

For those of us who cover the EPA, Pruitt’s profound impact on policy has been hard to miss. What’s tougher to see, behind the secrecy and paranoia, is how his new job has advanced his own future plans. There have been rumors he is interested in replacing Jeff Sessions as attorney general and whispers that he sees himself as a future president. His zeal—or overzealousness—might be seen as typical behavior for an inexperienced man thrust into the major leagues of a Cabinet position. But his political calculations and driving ambition can all be traced 1,210 miles west of Washington, DC, to the place he’s called home for nearly three-fifths of his life.

Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, 15 miles southeast of Tulsa, is a prosperous town, named for Native Americans forcibly relocated there in 1836, during the Trail of Tears expulsion organized by Trump’s hero President Andrew Jackson. Like much of Oklahoma, it’s dominated by the energy industry. A largely white town of 107,000 residents, with a median income 43 percent higher than the rest of the state, Broken Arrow is also home to many evangelical mega-churches.

One is the First Baptist Church of Broken Arrow, whose campus is marked by a water tower, emblazoned with its name, that’s visible for miles. With a coffee shop, a bookstore, and an indoor basketball court, the church has expanded to meet the needs of 2,800 members and, as its website proclaims, “to reach everyone that we can with the Gospel of Jesus Christ in Broken Arrow, Tulsa, Oklahoma, North America, and the Ends of the Earth.”

I met Nick Garland, an animated 66-year-old senior pastor who had just returned from a trip to DC. There, he and a few dozen others—Pruitt’s friends from around the country and other influential Oklahomans—attended a private reception in the EPA administrator’s offices. Garland was one of the few who had known Pruitt for decades, not from his political life, but as a family man and deacon, deeply committed to his evangelical faith. Garland has watched Pruitt since the early ’90s, when Pruitt was a law student and the pastor recruited him and his wife to First Baptist. Over the years, Pruitt’s commitment to the congregation has been unwavering. His two children grew up in this church. Shortly after law school, he joined fellow parishioners on a missionary trip to Romania. When he was the state’s attorney general, he taught a seminar on how to blend one’s faith into communication and current events.

During his early days in Oklahoma, Garland says, Pruitt knew “there was something more he’s supposed to do than be a student of law.” Garland, who has a collection of eagle-themed memorabilia scattered around his office, compares Pruitt to the bird. “Eagles are one of the rare creations of God that delight in the storm,” he says. The 114-year-old Broken Arrow church subscribes to a conservative branch of the Southern Baptist tradition. When dozens of evangelical leaders endorsed Pruitt’s nomination in late 2016, they wrote an open letter explaining their rejection of “any ideology that sees human beings as a blight upon the planet and would harm human flourishing by restricting or preventing the rightful use and enjoyment of creation.” This echoed a view of environmental stewardship that has become widely accepted in conservative evangelical communities: “He created human beings in His own image, bearing responsibility to advance human flourishing through many forms of human activity, from agriculture and enterprise to technology and innovation,” the religious leaders wrote. In other words, the planet’s resources are there for the purpose of human use.

This approach is the polar opposite from that of other religious leaders—including Pope Francis—who interpret stewardship as the responsibility humans have to protect God’s creation for as long as possible. “Is true environmentalism ‘do not touch’?” Pruitt remarked last year. “It’s like having a beautiful apple orchard that could feed the world, but the environmentalists put up a fence around the apple orchard and say, ‘Do not touch the apple orchard because it may spoil the apple orchard.'”

I asked Garland to shed some light on the remark. “Either we’re going to steward the Earth and use it for God’s glory and man’s good, or we serve the Earth,” Garland says. Failing to use the Earth for our benefit, he notes, would violate Genesis 2:15, which concerns the relationship between humans and the natural world: “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.” Garland does not believe humans are the main cause of climate change, and neither does Pruitt. “I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” Pruitt said in March 2017. But his biblical references are not restricted to climate change. Pruitt’s two guiding stars—evangelical faith and political zeal—sometimes seem interchangeable. In October, when he announced a controversial new “conflict of interest” policy barring researchers who receive EPA grants from serving on the agency’s science advisory boards, he quoted the Book of Joshua: “Choose this day whom you’re going to serve.”

If the roots of Pruitt’s religious approach to policy are deep, so is his yearning for power and influence. In a 2010 campaign ad, Pruitt explained that his will to succeed began at his birth as a three-pound premature baby. He grew up in Kentucky, spent his freshman year at a state university, and then graduated in 1990 from Georgetown College, a Christian school, with a degree in political science and communications. He played second base and dreamed of going pro. His friends told E&E News that his appearance inspired the nickname “the possum“—a creature that deceives its enemies by playing dead.

Pruitt married Marlyn Lloyd in Louisville, Kentucky, after graduation and they moved to Tulsa for law school. I visited Jim Thomas, Pruitt’s administrative law professor, at the small firm he shares with his son. Wearing an Oklahoma sweatshirt, he settled into an armchair at a large conference table. The 89-year-old recalled Pruitt as conservative, personable, and striving, someone who had already set his sights on elected office, with hopes to perhaps become governor someday. Pruitt was driven not by a fascination with the workings of government—Thomas remembers he had little interest in environmental law or policy in general—but by sheer political ambition. “I’ve had a lot of politicians go through the University of Tulsa,” says Thomas, who’s been active in Oklahoma’s Democratic Party and says he knows how “to spot somebody who seems suited for politics…And that’s the way I saw Scott Pruitt.”

Pruitt remained in Tulsa and ran a small private practice, Christian Legal Services, where he specialized in constitutional and employment law and worked with several local firms. One of his first major clients, whom he met through church, was J.D. Young, an executive at a well-known oil equipment company, Tulsa Rig Iron. Young had deep connections in the community. David Page, the senior attorney who worked alongside Pruitt for the client, recalls that “on more than one occasion, [Young] said that Scott’s real ambition in life, from his perspective, was to be a well-known politician.”

When Pruitt turned 30 in 1998, he ran for the state Senate against a longtime incumbent Republican. He won on the unexpected strength of the evangelical turnout. David Blatt, a political scientist then working as a budget analyst for the Oklahoma state Senate, remembers colleagues taking note of the surprise win. As a state senator and eventually the Republican whip, Pruitt was a conventional social conservative and a member of the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council. He was particularly focused on the religious right’s core causes, including prayer in public schools and stopping same-sex marriage and abortion.

Pruitt left the Legislature after eight years, following losses in Republican primaries for a US House seat in 2001 and the lieutenant governor’s office in 2006. In 2003, while he was still in his state seat, Pruitt returned to his first love by becoming the co-owner and managing general partner of the RedHawks, a minor league baseball team based in Oklahoma City. Why might a legislator from Tulsa want to run a baseball team in Oklahoma City? Blatt, who now heads Oklahoma Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, says it made sense in the context of Pruitt’s ambition: “Owning the RedHawks would have definitely cemented relationships with the business elite of Oklahoma City and some of the oil industry folks.”

By 2010, when Pruitt announced his candidacy for attorney general, he had built a deep network, and with help from the new Citizens United ruling and the rise of the tea party, donors who had previously supported him—the likes of Devon Energy’s Larry Nichols and Koch Industries­—­stepped up. He campaigned on a platform of resisting the Obama administration, promising to file a lawsuit against Obamacare and pledging to push back against Washington at every opportunity, which often meant fighting environmental regulations. He won easily.

By this time, Pruitt’s old colleague David Page had been working with the attorney general’s office for five years on a major case against poultry companies accused of dumping manure that seeped into the Illinois River watershed. These same poultry companies contributed to Pruitt’s campaign. So when Page saw Pruitt at Tulsa’s Dilly Diner one Sunday after church, he thought he’d ask about his plans for the case. “I don’t believe in using lawsuits to change public policy,” Pruitt replied. Eventually, Pruitt agreed to a settlement that set aside some money for a study on the issue but required no concrete action.

Even more striking for Page was that while Pruitt insisted he had no interest in changing policy through the courts, he soon launched lawsuit after lawsuit to do just that. Pruitt enthusiastically joined more than a dozen suits filed by Republican-led states and energy companies against the federal government over environmental policy and health care. He also fulfilled a campaign promise to set up a Federalism Unit, committed to battling so-called interference from Washington. And he disbanded Oklahoma’s environmental protection unit.

“We have a full-on captive agency right now that is obedient not to the public, but to the fossil fuel polluters.”

This was in contrast to Pruitt’s Democratic predecessor, Drew Edmondson, who is now running for governor. “We were there to enforce consumer protection laws and antitrust laws and environmental laws,” he says. “That’s what the attorney general is supposed to do. I’m certainly not naive enough to believe that other philosophies don’t exist.”

Pruitt’s philosophy went over well within Oklahoma’s conservative policy circles. When oil prices sank globally and state revenue plunged, most agencies saw their budgets cut. Pruitt’s expanded by 40 percent, and he hired nearly 60 new employees focused on fighting legal battles against the Obama administration, according to the Associated Press.

On the national level, Pruitt became active in the Republican Attorneys General Association, which has received substantial money from the fossil fuel industry, and served as chairman of the dark-money nonprofit the Rule of Law Defense Fund. A Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times series detailed the web of connections Pruitt developed through these groups. In one instance, he copied and pasted a letter that the oil and gas corporation Devon Energy had drafted in opposition to an Obama administration attempt to rein in methane leaks from drilling operations. After making a few small changes and printing it on government letterhead, he signed his name to fight the regulation.

“I think he’s made the bet that the fossil fuel industry will take care of him one way or another,” says Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the committee that oversees the EPA. “They reward obedience, and nobody has been more obedient than Scott Pruitt.” Indeed, what environmentalists see as Pruitt’s boundless loyalty to corporate interests, or “stakeholders,” as he invariably calls them, is considered an asset by his supporters. One of them is former GOP Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who was serving the second of his two terms while Pruitt was in the state Senate. “Scott Pruitt is a conservative icebreaker. He doesn’t tread water,” he says. “Pruitt always tried to find a hard solution. I found him to be focused but sensible.”

Throughout Pruitt’s tenure as Oklahoma’s attorney general, activists tried to pry open his email records, which his office refused to disclose. On Pruitt’s first day at the EPA, his former office finally released some of those emails under a court order. They included correspondence from Pruitt’s staff thanking Devon Energy executives for their help drafting an argument against Obama’s methane regulations, and others from executives thanking Pruitt’s office. “You are so amazingly helpful!!!” read an email from Pruitt’s chief of staff to Devon Energy. The messages also revealed that Pruitt had used a private email account for state business, despite having denied doing so during his EPA confirmation hearing.

This case is ongoing as public interest groups try to obtain thousands of other messages that appear to have been left out of the public disclosure. The Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is suing for the emails. For Brady Henderson of the ACLU, Pruitt’s lack of transparency as attorney general and his claim under oath that he didn’t use a private email account were early indications of what has become business as usual in the Trump administration. “It’s very possible to have enough confidence to say, ‘Yeah, I’m just going to lie, and who’s going to do anything about it?'”

In an administration full of deregulators, Pruitt stands out, bringing to the EPA the anti-Washington playbook he developed with industry in Oklahoma. In December 2017, the White House trumpeted presidential accomplishments from Trump’s first year—a list dominated by handouts to the energy industry. Pruitt’s fingerprints were everywhere, from “exiting the Paris climate agreement” to “ending the war on coal.” It’s an agenda that taps directly into the right-wing populism that was integral to Trump’s success—and a corporate donor base that will be vital to Pruitt’s future.

One of Trump’s first actions as president was the creation of a new (and illegal, according to a complaint filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and other groups) order requiring agencies to jettison two existing regulations for every new one created. Once more, Pruitt was an overachiever. After 10 months, the EPA had put forward just one new rule—restricting the amount of mercury that dentists’ offices can release—while leading other agencies by freezing or reversing 16 regulations. By early 2018, Pruitt had placed nearly 50 existing regulations under review.

The EPA’s regulatory framework is vast and complex, meaning little can be built in a year. Often, the legal battles over rule-making span multiple administrations. During Obama’s eight years, the EPA pushed forward several long-delayed regulations—some mandated by courts—to strengthen the nation’s ozone standards, impose limits on pollution that crosses state lines, curtail mercury emissions from coal-fired plants, and protect drinking water.

Under Trump and Pruitt, much of the hard-won progress of the Obama administration has been attacked, including landmark climate policies such as the Clean Power Plan’s caps on carbon pollution from power plants and limits on methane emissions from oil and gas operations. So have dozens of rules that, with the Clean Power Plan, would have prevented tens of thousands of premature deaths and saved billions of dollars in public health benefits.

Meanwhile, enforcement has dropped precipitously, with fines on offenders down 60 percent in just the first seven months of 2017. “We have a full-on captive agency right now that is obedient not to the public, but to the fossil fuel polluters,” says Whitehouse.

The situation may be permanent. Staffers who have served at the agency for decades predict that the EPA of the future will be a regulatory body essentially controlled by industry—operating on a shoestring budget, unable to fill entry-level roles, and lacking institutional knowledge at higher stations. About 800 employees have already left, meeting Trump’s goal of cutting agency staffing to levels not seen since the 1980s. At the end of 2017, Pruitt put a check mark next to “Reagan-era staff levels” on a list of his accomplishments from the year.

Another accomplishment on Pruitt’s list was “science board transparency”—a reference to one of the more obscure ways in which well-established facts have come under relentless assault. The EPA has two major independent scientific advisory boards, the Science Advisory Board and the Board of Scientific Counselors, which serve as a backstop to ensure the agency’s policy reflects the best available science. Appointments can include experts from academia, government, or industry. Because the government also funds environmental research, it’s not uncommon for a scientist, appointed to the board for her public health expertise, to also receive EPA grants to conduct her own research.

“Pray for me. I’ve got something I feel like I’m supposed to run for.”

On Halloween, to an audience that included few reporters but several industry reps—including Steve Milloy, the former policy and strategy director of Murray Energy and a prominent climate denier—Pruitt announced a new plan. No scientist who received agency grants could serve on the boards. Seven board members were forced to leave immediately; two more chose to decline the EPA grants. Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, called the move a “desire to limit expert perspectives and the role of scientific information.”

To replace the departing scientists, Pruitt appointed industry supporters, including Michael Honeycutt, a toxicologist from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality who has built his career arguing that the impacts of air pollution are overstated. He is now the chair of the Science Advisory Board. Pruitt picked more than a dozen people to fill the empty seats of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors and 15 others for the 47-member Science Advisory Board, many of them former executives and staffers from organizations that have a stake in limiting the EPA’s chemical and air quality work, such as the utility Southern Co., Phillips 66, Total, and the American Chemistry Council.

Many of Trump’s appointees arrived in Washington with agendas that conflict with their agencies’ historic missions. Trump’s energy secretary, Rick Perry, famously called for eliminating the Department of Energy when he ran for president in 2011. But here, too, Pruitt led the pack. “I’ve never known any administrator to go into office with such an apparent disregard for the agency mission definition or science,” says former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush. Politics has always been part of agency decision making, she acknowledges, but now it “is starting to override science and the mission of the agency.”

Pruitt has proved especially creative in pursuing this political agenda by drumming up public confusion around climate science. Instead of taking any formal action, he’s interested in hosting what’s basically a reality show contest on the legitimacy of science. Take the endangerment finding, the agency’s key scientific determination that carbon pollution’s impact on climate change harms human health. Prompted by a 2007 Supreme Court decision, it allows the agency to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act and served as the basis for Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Climate deniers detest the endangerment finding, and many hoped the Trump administration would do away with it entirely. Pruitt has thrown red meat to the skeptics, saying on television that humans aren’t the “primary contributor” to global warming.

But a direct attack by Pruitt on the endangerment finding would entail a great deal of work, lots of lawsuits, and an unclear payoff. As former EPA air and radiation officer Janet McCabe told me, “Review of the endangerment finding would need to consider all the available science and respond to the public comments that will certainly be provided to the agency on such an important issue.” Big energy companies and industry groups tend to prefer a less risky strategy and have lobbied instead for simply replacing Obama’s Clean Power Plan with weaker rules.

Pruitt has opted for an idea floated in conservative editorials that would undermine the finding in the minds of the public. He proposed holding high-profile “red team, blue team” debates over climate science. On one side would be scientists who represent the consensus that greenhouse emissions are dangerously warming the atmosphere, and on the other would be the tiny minority of skeptics and fossil fuel advocates. Perhaps with an eye to Trump’s voracious viewing habits, Pruitt said he wanted the debate, which has been put on hold, televised.

Still, that hasn’t been enough for some Trump allies. A month after the new administrator took office, Trump’s EPA appointee David Schnare resigned, later explaining that Pruitt never tried to understand the regulations he was dismantling, refused to meet with experts on staff, and only relied “on the extremely short briefs I provided at his morning staff meeting.” Myron Ebell, who led Trump’s EPA transition team, reportedly told fellow climate deniers that Pruitt’s lassitude in filling rank-and-file jobs amounted to a “totally dysfunctional personnel process.”

There are other, less visible influencers in Pruitt’s work as well. During Trump’s campaign, a photograph appeared in OKC Friday, a small Oklahoma newspaper, of local politicians and powerful oil and gas executives attending a September 2016 fundraiser. One photograph was of Pruitt, laughing with Devon Energy’s Nichols, who had previously supported Sen. Marco Rubio. A co-chair of the event was oilman Harold Hamm, a self-made billionaire who pioneered hydraulic fracturing and chaired Pruitt’s reelection campaign for attorney general in 2014.

After the inauguration, Hamm revealed one of his expectations for the new administration. At an oil and gas panel in Houston, he made an observation that seemed to cause the other two oil executives onstage to shift uncomfortably in their seats. He announced that the Obama administration “wanted to eliminate our industry like they wanted to eliminate coal,” despite the fact that oil and gas enjoyed boom times under Obama. But it was clear what Hamm intended: By positioning itself as a victim of the Democratic administration, his industry would receive even more robust protection from Trump.

What transpired may have exceeded his expectations. In December, Pruitt flew with a seven-person entourage and security personnel to Morocco. He toured some solar and thermal energy projects, and there were photos of him deep in conversation with Moroccan leaders. But he also went, according to an EPA press release, to promote US exports of liquefied natural gas (from companies such as Hamm’s). When asked to respond to the criticism that the trip was outside the scope of the administrator’s duties, the EPA replied with a link to its press release.

Inside the agency, Pruitt has surrounded himself with security and walled himself off from the experts on staff. Before Betsy Southerland retired from her position in the EPA Office of Water in protest, she remembers observing him walk down the halls of the agency flanked by two men with earpieces. Employees tend to notice the guard who now surrounds the administrator because it’s a departure from customary EPA practices; past administrators relied on door-to-door protection only for events outside the agency. The 24/7 security detail is composed of staffers who would otherwise likely be investigating enforcement cases for the agency. The EPA’s reasoning for Pruitt’s guard is that this administrator has faced more threats than others. He has built a secure communications facility inside his office, justifying the expense as “necessary for me to be able to do my job,” though the EPA already has one in its buildings. Staffers have reported not being allowed to take notes in meetings or carry their cellphones, limiting the paper trail that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act.

This kind of secrecy is unprecedented and absurd, says Bush-era EPA chief Whitman: “We’re not talking about the FBI. We’re not talking about Homeland Security.” None of it adds up—that is, until you consider that the security provides another layer of opacity to the agency’s operations and makes it more difficult for whistleblowers to undermine Pruitt’s efforts. “I think he views his administration as a hostile takeover of the agency,” says Southerland.

As part of that hostile takeover, Pruitt spent most of his first year meeting with his stakeholders in industry. According to a Washington Post analysis of his public schedule, Pruitt held 218 meetings in 2017 with representatives of industries he regulates. He also gave dozens of interviews to Fox News and right-wing talk radio and delivered speeches in front of conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation. He met just a dozen times with environmental and public health groups.

During Hurricane Harvey, while a scattered, demoralized EPA was handling its emergency response, Pruitt’s press office was focused on challenging accounts of disarray. In one memorable press release, the EPA attacked an Associated Press report about the lack of agency presence at flooded Superfund sites as “yellow journalism.” The agency pointed to the fact that it had conducted an aerial review of the sites and referenced Breitbart News to further discredit the AP’s additional reporting.

“I think he views his administration as a hostile takeover of the agency.”

Without much hope that the agency will answer questions, mainstream reporters have turned to its glacial open records process for answers. Senators have complained that the agency has done no better for them. Democrats, who have already asked for EPA inspector general audits of Pruitt’s travel, including his frequent trips to Oklahoma, recently requested that the independent office add the Morocco visit to their list and examine “whether the purpose of travel is consistent with the EPA’s mission.”

At the same time, Pruitt installed fellow Oklahoma conservatives in EPA positions that don’t require Senate confirm­ation. He has hired several old friends, as well as four staffers who have worked for the Senate’s most prominent climate denier, Oklahoma Republican James Inhofe.

One of those hires was Albert Kelly, a former banker with no environmental experience, whose company issued three mortgages to the Pruitts, according to an investigation by the Intercept, for their $605,000 home in an upscale Tulsa neighborhood. Kelly’s company also financed Pruitt’s stake in the RedHawks. Last year the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fined Kelly for his alleged involvement in a loan that hadn’t received FDIC approval. Two weeks later, Pruitt hired him to lead the EPA’s Superfund Task Force—which Pruitt has singled out as a priority for the agency and an early success story.

As almost everyone I spoke with noted, Pruitt is a far more political creature—and quite talented in that respect—than his predecessors have been. When I was in Oklahoma, his old friends and associates openly speculated about which office he would set his sights on next: Maybe the seat held by the 83-year-old Inhofe? A governor’s race? The White House?

One way or another, “I don’t think EPA is his ultimate destination,” University of Tulsa law and environmental professor Gary Allison says. According to Politico, Pruitt is reportedly interested in Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ job, should Sessions resign from his post—a move that could put Pruitt squarely in the middle of the Russia investigation. (Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the EPA and a longtime Republican operative, told news outlets the rumors were “not true.”)

Will Pruitt remain as EPA chief for Trump’s entire four—or eight—years? That’s anybody’s guess. But what’s clear is that this position will not be the pinnacle of Pruitt’s career. Before each previous campaign, Pastor Garland recalls, Pruitt “would come and visit and say, ‘Pray for me. I’ve got something I feel like I’m supposed to run for.'” He describes a similar pattern after Trump won and Pruitt was summoned to Trump Tower in New York City. “We prayed for him through that process when he went up there for the interview,” he says. “He felt very humbled but very eager to serve in a national capacity.”

So, I asked Garland, what’s next?

“Stay tuned,” he replied with a big, loud laugh. “We may have this conversation again sometime.”Looking for news you can trust?

On a warm Friday evening in late February, Stacey Abrams held a fundraiser at Old Lady Gang, a popular Atlanta soul food restaurant owned by Kandi Burruss, the star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Abrams is running for governor of Georgia. If she wins, she won’t just be the state’s first black female governor, but the nation’s. Every detail of this evening had been strategically planned to play up Abrams’ appeal to black women.

Nearly all of the hundred or so donors had just come from Power Rising, a conference about black women in politics. The celebrity host was Erika Alexander, an actress and producer best known for her role in the ’90s sitcom Living Single. A who’s who of black women Democratic officeholders had shown up to support Abrams: Rep. Frederica Wilson, the bedazzled-cowboy-hat-wearing Florida congresswoman who chastised President Donald Trump for allegedly telling the widow of a dead soldier that “he knew what he signed up for”; Rep. Gwen Moore, Wisconsin’s first black representative; and Rep. Alma Adams, a veteran lawmaker from North Carolina known for her collection of more than 1,100 church hats.

Abrams is a tall, sturdy woman with a warm, gap-toothed smile. Taking the stage in a deep purple dress, the 44-year-old dived into a story about the time she was chosen to represent her home state of Mississippi at the Girl Scouts’ national conference in the mid-’80s. “But there were some folks in our Girl Scout troop who were unhappy with me”—a black girl—”being selected,” she said. When she got to the airport, she found out that someone had changed her reservation. “They thought if they left me behind, I’d stay gone.” Instead, she got on her first flight ever and traveled by herself to Arizona. “There are gonna be a lot of people who try to stop you from getting on that plane,” she told the rapt audience. “There are a lot of people organizing themselves to make sure I land at the wrong destination. There are folks who don’t think it’s time for a black woman to be governor of any state, let alone a state in the Deep South. But there’s no wrong time for a black woman to be in charge.”

“There are folks who don’t think it’s time for a black woman to be governor of any state, let alone a state in the Deep South. But there’s no wrong time for a black woman to be in charge.”

A prolific author who penned romantic thrillers before she entered politics, Abrams excels at telling stories—particularly tales in which a protagonist encounters an evil, resists the urge to give up, and charges into the unknown. “Faith is difficult,” she says. “That’s why the Bible talks about it so much.” Abrams’ quest to become the first black woman governor is a leap of political faith. While she needs her peers’ support, she also needs to build a coalition of young people, immigrants, and whites—including Republicans who are uncomfortable with Trump’s flirtation with white nationalism. Some have dubbed this the “new Southern strategy.” But to make such an approach work, Abrams must appeal to people who usually don’t vote for candidates who look like her.

Born in 1973, the second of six children, Abrams grew up in Gulfport, Mississippi. Her mother was a school librarian and her father was a shipyard worker. “Mississippi had perfected soul-crushing poverty wrapped in gentility,” she would later write in her memoir and self-help book, Minority Leader: How to Lead from the Outside and Make Real Change, which comes out later this month. When Abrams was in high school, her family moved to Atlanta so her parents could attend divinity school to become Methodist ministers. After graduating as her class valedictorian, she went to Spelman College, the premier historically black college for women.

At Spelman, she struggled to find her footing among the school’s “daughters of accomplishment.” Then, in April 1992, when she was a sophomore, the Rodney King verdict sparked violent protests in black communities across the country, including Atlanta’s West End, home to Spelman, Morehouse, and two other historically black colleges. As the Atlanta police moved in with tear gas against the students and residents of nearby public housing projects, Abrams grew furious at the media’s characterization of the young people in the streets as “angry vandals, rather than complex human beings who had seen in a single verdict an indictment of our humanity,” as she later wrote. She began calling up local TV stations to complain about their coverage. When they kept hanging up on her, she enlisted her dormmates to make calls.

A local TV producer took notice and invited her to participate in a town hall meeting with Maynard Jackson, Atlanta’s first black mayor. At the event, Jackson criticized the young people he said had wreaked havoc on the city. Abrams asked Jackson what he had done for dispossessed youth—a question that challenged the mayor but also impressed him. A few months later, Abrams began work as a research assistant for the mayor’s office of youth services.

Abrams would earn a master’s degree from the University of Texas and a law degree from Yale before returning to Atlanta as a tax attorney. In 2003, at just 29 years old, she was appointed Atlanta’s deputy city attorney. She was elected to the state Assembly in 2006 and became Georgia’s House minority leader in 2010—the first African American to do so.

Abrams is tapping into a moment when Democrats are finally realizing how much they owe to the black women who have long been intensely loyal to the party. In 2012, black women voted at higher rates nationally than any other demographic group. In 2016, 94 percent of them voted for Hillary Clinton. (Less than half of white women did.) And in a fiercely contested special election in Alabama in December 2017, black women supported the Democratic winner, Doug Jones, by a 98-2 margin. After Jones’ slim victory, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez tweeted, “Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we can’t take that for granted. Period.”

Let me be clear: We won in Alabama and Virginia because #BlackWomen led us to victory. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and we can’t take that for granted. Period. — Tom Perez (@TomPerez) December 13, 2017

But black women’s clout at the ballot box has not translated into representation. Nationwide, only 12 black women have ever been elected to statewide executive positions such as attorney general or lieutenant governor. Research shows that women candidates have to work harder than men to raise money, and black women who run for office face the additional burden of representing areas with less money to pull from. Some feel their fundraising is unfairly scrutinized because they are seen as not raising enough cash—or raising too much. Sarah Bryner, the research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, says black women candidates “face the same kinds of intersectional problems that they face in all sorts of areas—they have difficulty raising money because they’re women and because they’re black.”

On the one hand, Abrams is quick to tout the significance of being a black woman seeking higher office. But she’s also aware she has to beat her main opponent in the May 22 Democratic primary, Stacey Evans, a white state Assembly member. To do that, she’ll need white voters, and white women in particular, to rally to her side. “I do not disparage anyone based on race. I do not isolate any community based on religion. I want everybody,” Abrams says. “But I am going to focus on progressive voters who run the cross section of racial and economic and regional geography but who share core values that I have.”

Georgia is changing, and Abrams’ campaign is a bet on the future—though it’s not clear if the rainbow coalition she hopes to assemble is in place yet. People of color are predicted to be a minority of Georgia’s eligible voting population until 2036. Trump won the state by 5 percentage points in 2016, and it has been nearly two decades since a Democrat has been elected governor there.

So far, however, Abrams’ burgeoning national profile has helped get her fundraising off to a good start. By the end of March, she had out-fundraised Evans, bringing in nearly $3.3 million. A Democratic donor in San Francisco has said she’ll raise another $2.5 million for Abrams, including shelling out $1 million of her own fortune. Yet Abrams has already burned through $1.8 million, as of last month, opening field offices and building her get-out-the-vote operation, stoking fears about how much cash she has on hand. “Any businessperson will tell you it’s not who has the biggest bank account when you start a business, it’s who gets the most customers,” she says at her campaign headquarters. Whoever wins the primary will likely face Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a Republican who made headlines when he got the state to revoke a tax benefit for Delta Air Lines, a major employer, after it announced it would cancel its discounts for National Rifle Association members. He has already raised nearly $6.8 million.

Back at Old Lady Gang, Abrams told the room of supportive black women another war story. In 2014, she recalled, 800,000 eligible Georgians weren’t registered to vote—a group equal to the population of South Dakota. Three-fourths were black. Abrams took action, registering 200,000 people of color in less than three years through her $7 million New Georgia Project. “But I’ll tell you a dirty little secret: Some of the folks who fought against me looked like the folks in this room,” she said, seeming to refer to the former Atlanta mayor and other black politicians who questioned the need for her project and challenged her financial transparency. But she persevered.

Abrams then pulled back to make her broader pitch. After traveling to 155 of Georgia’s 159 counties and talking to voters who don’t look anything like her—”my hair’s a little different and I’m a little taller”—Abrams said she is more certain than ever that her job is not politics, but service. “I grew up working poor in Mississippi. And I’ll tell you this: I’ve never met a poor person who hates rich people. We hate being poor.” The crowd erupted in cheers as Abrams explained that Georgia needs a governor who understands the difference. “It’s not about begrudging anyone else. It’s about wanting something for yourself, and being willing to work for it if the systems will work with you and not against you.”
