American Media indicated earlier this month that it would fight Ms. McDougal, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her lawsuit.

But that was roughly a week before federal investigators obtained email communications, audio recordings and other documentation from Mr. Cohen during their raid of his office, home and hotel room. Those materials included information about American Media and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.

The suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks between A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal’s lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson — who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the talks. A.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.

Mr. Stris said on Wednesday that before reaching the settlement he was prepared to answer American Media’s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal’s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery, in which both sides would have been compelled to share emails and other records that could have provided information about the deal from inside American Media that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Stris said he would ask to submit written questions to Mr. Trump, and ask for several internal documents.

The settlement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal’s civil case, though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they need to fully vet the process behind the deal. “I have tremendous confidence in the men and woman of the Southern District of New York,” he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.

The initial deal precluded Ms. McDougal from speaking about her affair with Mr. Trump, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer “legitimate press inquiries,” in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent weeks, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.

Separate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure. The publisher has denied this, saying it was acting solely as a news organization with a First Amendment right to run stories — or not run them — as it chooses.“A guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.’ And he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl, it would be a shame if something happened to her mom,’ ” Ms. Clifford said in March during an interview aired on “60 Minutes.”

Ms. Daniels and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, are offering a $131,000 award for the person who identifies the man in the sketch.

Ms. Clifford has said that Mr. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid her $130,000 to keep quiet about an affair she says she had with Mr. Trump while he was married. The F.B.I. has been investigating Mr. Cohen for bank fraud related to this payment and other matters.

Ms. Clifford filed a lawsuit in California last month in which she claims a nondisclosure agreement she signed shortly before the 2016 presidential election was null and void because Mr. Trump never signed it.

Mr. Trump, who is known for tweeting his mind, has said little about the scandal. This month, he denied knowing about the payment Mr. Cohen made. Mr. Avenatti has said that the president’s denial only helps his client’s case. In his own Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Avenatti appeared to regard the president’s tweet as a gift and called Mr. Trump a “completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent.”

Mr. Avenatti also tweeted on Wednesday, saying that evidence collected in an F.B.I. raid on Mr. Cohen’s office and residences would show documents and recordings “showing con job after con job.”

In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Avenatti said the president’s tweet calling the sketch a “total con job” could lead to a defamation lawsuit. Mr. Avenatti said the president “has now effectively called my client a liar” and accused Ms. Clifford of “perpetrating a con.” Mr. Avenatti said he will decide in the coming days whether to pursue a such a claim.

David A. Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, said Mr. Trump’s tweet on Wednesday is not likely to have an impact on his legal problems.

“I don’t think it hurts him,” Mr. Super said, because Mr. Trump tweeted about information that is in the public domain and does not reveal inside knowledge that only he would know.

Mr. Super said a defamation suit is probably a “stretch.” At this point, Mr. Super said, Ms. Clifford is a public figure and therefore would have to prove that Mr. Trump knew he was being dishonest or reckless when he said the sketch amounted to a “con job.”

“Of his tweets, I think it’s one of the better designed, one of the less self-destructive,” Mr. Super said.Republican voters in Tennessee “don’t consider him an evil liberal person,” said Victor H. Ashe, a Republican and former longtime mayor of Knoxville. He predicted a tight race and said Ms. Blackburn could not afford to lose a significant chunk of Republican voters to her Democratic opponent.

In a nominal show of support for Ms. Blackburn, Mr. Corker wrote on Twitter last week that he was sending a donation to her campaign and wished her well in the Senate race. But in a brief interview, he said he would not campaign against Mr. Bredesen, recounting their long history working together and describing him as a friend.

“He was a very good mayor, very good governor, very good businessperson,” Mr. Corker said, adding, “He would be successful at anything that he did and is someone I consider to be very thoughtful.”

But there is ample reason for skepticism about Mr. Bredesen’s chances: No Democrat has won a statewide race in Tennessee since his successful re-election bid in 2006, and the state has turned more Republican since then. He will have to avoid being portrayed as being in lock step with national Democratic figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.

Ms. Blackburn and her allies “know that Bredesen is popular; they know that the national brand of the Democratic Party is not,” said Kent Syler, who teaches at Middle Tennessee State and was a longtime aide to former Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee. “So they will work very hard to connect him to that national brand, and he will work very hard to avoid that.”

Mr. Bredesen, 74, jumped into the race after Mr. Corker, a two-term Republican, decided to retire. A wealthy former health care executive who served as mayor of Nashville before becoming governor, Mr. Bredesen said he concluded that he was probably the only Democrat who would have a reasonable shot at winning the seat. In a video announcing his candidacy, he reminded voters of the successes of his tenure, including reining in the soaring cost of TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which had been financially troubled.

His decision to run for the Senate was a coup for Democrats in Washington who have been mapping out how to flip control of the chamber in November’s elections, even as their caucus defends 26 seats, 10 in states won by Mr. Trump, while the Republicans must guard only nine. Once seen as far-fetched, winning a majority is at least mathematically possible, especially after a Democrat, Doug Jones, won a special election in Alabama in December.

Skepticism of a Democratic takeover of the Senate has come from an unlikely voice in Tennessee: Mr. Bredesen. To Republicans who suggest a vote for him is a vote to make Mr. Schumer the majority leader, he pushed back on the idea.

“I don’t think it’s possible, I’ll be honest with you,” he said, naming Florida, Missouri and North Dakota as states where Democratic incumbents could be in danger. “My expectation is that I will be in the minority in the Senate.”

Mr. Bredesen is walking a careful line when it comes to Mr. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton by 26 percentage points in Tennessee. “Look, I’m not running against Donald Trump,” he says in a television commercial that is textbook Bredesen sobriety.

In the interview, he emphasized his attentiveness to rural voters who feel like elected leaders are not doing anything to help them, recalling his own upbringing in upstate New York and offering a pointed critique of today’s Democratic Party.

“My party, I think, has gotten way too far to the left and needs to learn how to win elections,” he said. “I think we Democrats have gotten too elitist. We’ve gotten too narrow. We’ve gotten too involved in litmus tests.”

He continued: “I’d like to belong to a church that’s bringing new members in, not routing out dissidents or heretics or something like that, and I’m afraid we’ve gotten too much in the latter.”

Still, there are clear policy differences between Mr. Bredesen and the president. Mr. Bredesen said Mr. Trump’s promised wall along the border with Mexico was “political theater, not anything practical.” He also criticized the Republican tax overhaul for providing “crumbs” to the middle class — echoing a description previously used by Ms. Pelosi that Republicans eagerly seized on.

“I think they did something which was clever politically, but I couldn’t have swallowed morally, which is I think they threw a few crumbs to the middle class to give these huge breaks to wealthier people and corporations and so on,” Mr. Bredesen said. “And I think I would have called that out as strongly as I possibly could have.”

Ms. Blackburn speaks proudly of the tax overhaul, and she has allowed little distance between her and Mr. Trump.

“What we need in the U.S. Senate is a senator who is going to stand with President Donald Trump,” she told the crowd at a county Republican Party dinner in Murfreesboro this month, where a handful of young supporters wore red T-shirts that said “Marsha Marsha Marsha” on the back.

First elected to Congress in 2002 after serving as a state senator, Ms. Blackburn, 65, is a frequent presence on cable news channels. She has been a leading opponent of abortion, overseeing a House panel that investigated Planned Parenthood and the sale of fetal tissue for medical research. She once debated climate change with the television personality Bill Nye.

In a video announcing her candidacy, she described herself as a “hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative,” spoke of carrying a gun in her purse, declared she was “politically incorrect” and said, with a note of pride, that liberals call her a “wing nut.”

But Ms. Blackburn’s full-throated conservatism is distinctive compared with the relatively moderate tone of Republicans whom Tennessee voters have sent to the Senate in the past — a group that includes Howard H. Baker Jr., a former Senate majority leader who became known as “the great conciliator”; another majority leader, Bill Frist; Mr. Corker; and Tennessee’s senior senator, Lamar Alexander.

In a Vanderbilt University poll conducted last year, 76 percent of Tennessee voters said they preferred that their legislators worked with the other party, even if it meant compromising on some of their values.

Ms. Blackburn is sending a different message. “Real conservative leadership,” promises a palm card for her campaign. “No compromise, no apologies.”

Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, questioned whether Tennessee voters would embrace a candidate in that mold over someone with a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly image.

“We’ve never had a politician on that level of anybody that’s been kind of mocked for their antediluvian ways,” he said.

Ms. Blackburn suggested that people in Tennessee needed to get accustomed to the idea of being represented in the Senate by a woman.

“This is one of the things that you’ll hear people talk about from time to time, because Tennessee’s never had a female senator,” she said. “So it is going to be a little bit different, if you will. An approach will be different.”

Then there is the unresolved question of just how much Ms. Blackburn will be able to exploit Mr. Bredesen’s party affiliation — even if Mr. Bredesen himself is not eager to dwell on it.

Voters may have fond memories of Mr. Bredesen as governor, but will they want to help expand the ranks of the Senate Democratic caucus? Mr. Schumer personally courted Mr. Bredesen to run.

“You can’t talk one way at home and go to D.C. and support Chuck Schumer and expect that to be what the people of this state want,” Ms. Blackburn told the crowd in Murfreesboro. “And let me tell you something: Chuck Schumer as majority leader would be an absolute disaster.”

Mr. Bredesen scoffed at the idea that he would fall in line with Mr. Schumer, noting that he has a history of breaking with his party, including over the Affordable Care Act, which he roundly criticized.

“I’ve got a pretty good reputation as somebody who does not toe the party line on everything, which I think will help get through that,” Mr. Bredesen said of his opponent’s line of attack. “I’ve certainly made no commitments to be supportive of Chuck Schumer or anything else.”AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, is expected to testify as soon as Thursday, with John Stankey, AT&T’s senior vice president who is poised to run Time Warner after the merger, testifying later on Wednesday. Arguments are expected to close as early as April 30. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over the case, is expected to take about a month before giving his opinion.

For Mr. Bewkes, 65, the courtroom appearance was a rare public pleading to salvage a career-defining deal. The media titan is a 39-year veteran of Time Warner and has been chief executive since 2008, overseeing the rise of HBO, the spinoff of Time Warner Cable in 2009 and the turbulent evolution of CNN and the Warner Bros. movie studio.

Confident and congenial, Mr. Bewkes engaged directly with Judge Leon, leaning forward in his chair and making eye contact as he explained how the media industry is being challenged by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix.

Among the biggest problems for Time Warner as a stand-alone television and movie producer is that it does not have access to viewer data to target advertising and other customer information, the same way that Amazon and Netflix do, Mr. Bewkes said.

“We don’t have emails, contact information, billing information … any of these things,” he said.

At the center of the antitrust trial are arguments over consumer and competitive harms, with attention focused on economic analyses presented by both sides last week. The Justice Department and several consumer groups said the deal would hurt consumers, who would have to pay bigger bills as a result of higher prices for Time Warner programs.

The companies have argued that the Justice Department’s lawsuit is at least a decade behind the times. They portray their companies as underdogs struggling to compete against Silicon Valley titans. AT&T and Time Warner also have said it is highly unusual for the federal government to block a so-called vertical merger of companies that don’t directly compete.

Judge Leon has said the action was indeed a “rare breed of horse” but not a “unicorn.”

Mr. Bewkes and Mr. Stephenson have previously suggested that the Justice Department was influenced to block the deal by presidential politics. President Trump said during his election campaign that the deal should be denied. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly bashed CNN, the news network owned by Time Warner, for its coverage of his administration.

The Justice Department has denied any political interference in its suit to block the deal.It also underscores Mr. Trump’s unorthodox approach to one of the riskiest diplomatic gambits of his presidency. However trusted by the president, Mr. Pompeo is hardly a traditional emissary. He is not yet the nation’s chief diplomat but a lame duck as the nation’s spymaster.

Mr. Pompeo met with Mr. Kim on Easter Sunday, a senior official said, bringing along several aides from the C.I.A. — but nobody from the State Department and not the top Asia official on the National Security Council, Matthew Pottinger.

Some former administration officials expressed surprise that he returned from Pyongyang without any visible concessions, like the release of three Americans detained in North Korea. But it was unclear whether Mr. Kim did not offer such a gesture or whether Mr. Pompeo did not ask.

In 2014, the then-director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, traveled secretly to North Korea to negotiate the release of two Americans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller. Three Korean-Americans — Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang-duk, and Kim Hak-song — currently are being held on charges of espionage and committing hostile acts toward the North Korean state.

The administration also has not agreed on a date for the meeting of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, which officials said pointed to problems in settling on a site for the encounter. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters the White House was looking at five potential locations.

Some of the potential sites — like Singapore, Sweden, or Switzerland — are far from North Korea, posing a challenge to Mr. Kim’s rickety fleet of aircraft. Others, like the Peace House in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, or an American warship anchored off the Korean Peninsula, could pose an optics problem for one side or the other.

The Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, has surfaced as a possible compromise. Without a site, however, the White House has been unable to announce a date, though officials are sticking to Mr. Trump’s recent declaration that the meeting will be in late May or early June.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump added to the mystery surrounding the visit by appearing to confirm that he had been in direct contact with Mr. Kim himself. He later clarified that while the talks were at “the highest levels,” he would “leave it a little bit short of that.”

Mr. Pompeo’s involvement with North Korea predated Mr. Trump’s decision to meet Mr. Kim, several officials said. He has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau.

He also has been in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim’s invitation to Mr. Trump.

While a meeting of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim would be one of the boldest diplomatic gambles of recent years, it was orchestrated largely by the intelligence services of the three countries.

Officials said Mr. Suh, the South Korean spy chief, laid the groundwork for Mr. Kim’s invitation in negotiations and a subsequent meeting in Pyongyang with Kim Yong-chol, a powerful general who heads inter-Korean relations and used to run North Korea’s intelligence service.

Mr. Suh was one of two South Korean envoys who visited the White House to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang — which led to the president’s impromptu decision to accept Mr. Kim’s invitation.

For Mr. Pompeo, who now has an office at the State Department, the choice to use the intelligence channel was mostly a convenience — allowing him to be involved in the planning while he awaited his move to the State Department.

Still, some officials expressed concern about the C.I.A.’s taking the lead in orchestrating a leader-to-leader meeting — work that would normally fall to the State Department. The intelligence officials on the North Korean side, they said, are shadowy figures, not least Kim Yong-chol himself, who is accused of masterminding the torpedo attack that sank a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, killing 46 sailors.

The State Department’s role in North Korea dwindled after Mr. Trump publicly split with Mr. Tillerson over his efforts to open a diplomatic channel to the North, initially to obtain the release of the three Americans but also to set the stage for a broader negotiation.

In October, while Mr. Tillerson was in Beijing, Mr. Trump tweeted, “I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...”

The State Department recently lost its chief North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, who retired from the Foreign Service, in part because of his frustration with his agency’s diminished role.

The timing of Mr. Tillerson’s departure, officials said, was not coincidental. Mr. Trump wanted to have Mr. Pompeo in place to oversee an opening to North Korea. But Mr. Pompeo has expressed extremely hawkish views about North Korea, suggesting last summer that the United States should push for regime change.

“It would be a great thing to denuclearize the peninsula, to get those weapons off of that, but the thing that is most dangerous about it is the character who holds the control over them today,” Mr. Pompeo said at the Aspen Security Forum.

“So from the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two,” he said. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent and break those two apart.”

Last week, Mr. Pompeo insisted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he had never advocated for regime change.

“Just to be clear, my role as a diplomat is to make sure that we never get to a place where we have to confront the difficult situation in Korea that this country has been headed for now for a couple of decades,” he added.

Mr. Trump took up Mr. Pompeo’s cause, describing him before a lunch with Mr. Abe as “very smart but he gets along with people,” not least Mr. Kim. He predicted his nominee would clear the Senate, though he acknowledged the vote could be close.

Earlier, the White House recruited an ally, Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, to tell reporters that Democrats who came out against Mr. Pompeo were “two-bit Tallyrands” and “munchkin Metternichs” — in other words, low-rent imitations of famous European statesmen.

Mr. Trump’s senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said the decision to send Mr. Pompeo to Pyongyang showed the president already regarded him as “the nation’s chief diplomat.”“I always knew Barbara was the most beloved woman in the world, and in fact I used to tease her that I had a complex about that fact,” her husband said in a statement released on Wednesday. “But the truth is the outpouring of love and friendship being directed at The Enforcer is lifting us all up.

“We have faith that she is in heaven,” he added, “and we know that life will go on — as she would have it. So cross the Bushes off your worry list.”

Among the luminaries planning to attend Mrs. Bush’s funeral in Houston on Saturday is Melania Trump, the current first lady, representing the White House. Also planning to attend are former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the former first lady Michelle Obama, according to their offices.

While the White House did not rule out President Trump attending, it did not seem likely. He is no favorite of the Bush family; he regularly insulted Jeb Bush as he beat him for the Republican nomination in 2016 and he has bashed George W. Bush frequently. Neither of the two Republican former presidents voted for Mr. Trump — the father voted for Mrs. Clinton and the son later said he voted for “none of the above.”

It is not unusual for sitting presidents to skip funerals for former first ladies. Mr. Obama did not attend funerals for Betty Ford or Nancy Reagan. George W. Bush did not go to Lady Bird Johnson’s funeral. Mr. Clinton did not go to Patricia Nixon’s service, although he did attend the funeral for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Ronald Reagan did not go to Bess Truman’s service.

George W. Bush said on Wednesday that he spoke with Mrs. Bush by telephone shortly before her death to tell her he loved her, and she replied that she loved him too.

“It’s the end of a beautiful life,” Mr. Bush told Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network on Wednesday morning in his first interview following Mrs. Bush’s death. “She truly believes that there’s an afterlife, that she’ll be wonderfully received in the arms of a loving God and therefore did not fear death. And as a result of her soul being comforted on the deathbed, my soul is comforted.”

He appeared beside his wife, Laura Bush, who noted that she learned how to be first lady from her mother-in-law. “She was a great role model for me,” she said.

The former president said his two daughters — Barbara Bush, who was named for her grandmother, and Jenna Bush Hager — were dealing with the loss of Ganny, as they called her. “They’re emotional but as I explained to them, we ought to be joyful that we had such a wonderful woman in our lives and, two, that she passed with such strong beliefs. She truly was peaceful.”

Ms. Hager, a correspondent on NBC’s “Today” show, posted on Instagram a photograph of her as a child sitting next to her grandmother. “I already miss this FORCE of a woman — the ‘enforcer’ because she was the glue that held our family together,” she wrote. “She taught me to use my voice but also to value the opinions of others. She adored her friends and family; her loyalty was unwavering. Humor helps, she often said and it does, Gans, but I will miss your laugh terribly.”

Another grandchild took to Twitter to offer a tribute. “My grandmother didn’t just live life; she lived it well,” wrote George P. Bush, the land commissioner in Texas and the son of Jeb Bush. “And the sorrow of her loss is softened by the knowledge of her impact on our family and our country. I will miss you, Ganny — but know we will see you again.”

His father posted his own statement on Facebook. “I’m exceptionally privileged to be the son of George Bush and the exceptionally gracious, gregarious, fun, funny, loving, tough, smart, graceful woman who was the force of nature known as Barbara Bush,” Jeb Bush wrote.

Mrs. Bush will lie in repose at St. Martin’s Church in Houston, where she was well loved. There will be a public viewing on Friday before an invitation-only funeral service on Saturday.

Mrs. Bush will be interred at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Tex., next to her daughter, Robin, who died at age 3 from leukemia, a searing moment in the life of the future first couple.

Her eldest son had already been scheduled for the interview on Fox Business Network on Wednesday morning to promote a leadership forum at his own presidential center in Dallas. He went through with the event because he said his mother would have wanted him to.

“My mother would say, ‘Make darn sure you participate fully in the leadership forum,’ ” he said. “In other words, ‘Don’t sit around and feel sorry for me or yourself, more importantly, but move on with life.’ And that’s what we’re doing.”TOKYO — As every Japanese knows, when you travel abroad, you must bring home some “omiyage” — souvenirs.

But after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s first day visiting President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., the Japanese public is wondering whether their leader, embattled at home by influence-peddling scandals, might return to Japan with the diplomatic equivalent of an “All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt.”

When Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe appeared before reporters in Palm Beach on Tuesday, the American president declared that “Japan and ourselves are locked, and we are very unified on the subject of North Korea” and that Japan and the United States “have never been closer than they are right now.”

But as the two leaders were meeting, news emerged that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, had been to North Korea this month for secret meetings with its leader, Kim Jong-un. There, Mr. Pompeo was laying the groundwork for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim to discuss the North’s nuclear program.It also underscores Mr. Trump’s unorthodox approach to one of the riskiest diplomatic gambits of his presidency.

Last week, Mr. Pompeo insisted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he had never advocated for regime change.

“Just to be clear, my role as a diplomat is to make sure that we never get to a place where we have to confront the difficult situation in Korea that this country has been headed for now for a couple of decades,” he added.

Mr. Trump took up Mr. Pompeo’s cause, describing him before a lunch with Mr. Abe as “very smart but he gets along with people,” not least Mr. Kim. He predicted his nominee would clear the Senate, though he acknowledged the vote could be close.

Earlier, the White House recruited an ally, Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, to tell reporters that Democrats who came out against Mr. Pompeo were “two-bit Tallyrands” and “munchkin Metternichs” — in other words, low-rent imitations of famous European statesmen.

Mr. Trump’s senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, said the decision to send Mr. Pompeo to Pyongyang showed the president already regarded him as “the nation’s chief diplomat.”China said on Wednesday that it wanted to play a positive role in formally ending the war, in which an estimated three million Chinese soldiers fought. But it stopped short of endorsing the idea of a treaty, which is likely to involve extensive negotiations and would require the recognition of North Korea by the United States.

“China’s attitude is open and supportive to any peaceful means to resolve the Korean Peninsula issue through consultations,” Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said when asked at a news briefing in Beijing about supporting a possible treaty.

China has promoted the idea of a peace treaty from time to time over the past two decades, to little avail. This time, analysts said on Wednesday, Beijing’s enthusiasm for the idea is likely to be tempered by rising tensions with the Trump administration over trade and Taiwan. Chinese officials are livid over Washington’s move this week to prevent American suppliers from selling parts to the Chinese tech giant ZTE, they said.

“If the two countries cannot settle the trade issues, that will have a significant impact on China’s attitude toward helping the United States on North Korea,” said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at the Beijing-based Renmin University. “The ongoing situation with trade is complicating and undermining cooperation.”

At the same time, Mr. Cheng said, China’s relations with North Korea have rapidly warmed in the wake of Kim Jong-un’s surprise visit to Beijing last month. That could give China leverage with North Korea against the United States as Washington works out the terms of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.

South Korean officials said on Wednesday that they hoped Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon, during their meeting next week, could jointly announce a willingness to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ban military hostilities there, as a precursor to a peace treaty.

But Mr. Cheng and other Chinese analysts expressed skepticism that a peace treaty would be signed anytime soon. “If the United States is to sign with North Korea, it needs to do several things,” Mr. Cheng said. “It has to talk to China, and the United States has to recognize North Korea diplomatically.”

Only countries with diplomatic relations can sign a treaty, he said. “A treaty is not a memorandum or a communiqué.”

What the Conditions Might Be

Some analysts in South Korea have suggested that Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim could agree to withdraw weapons and troops from the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, which was created with the armistice and still divides the Koreas. Despite its name, the zone is the world’s most heavily armed border. Although the armistice allows only rifles and pistols within the area, both sides have deployed much heavier weapons and operate guard posts inside the zone.

In the past, the North’s conditions for its denuclearization have included the withdrawal of the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, a demand that Washington and Seoul have adamantly rejected. But Mr. Kim has recently indicated that he could be more flexible about the American military presence in the South if his country no longer felt threatened by it, according to officials and analysts in Seoul.

“We think that North Korea is more realistic about the security environment on the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Chung said on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Kim’s decision not to object to recent joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. The North has typically used such drills as a pretext to conduct weapons tests and reject dialogue.

In 2000, Mr. Kim’s late father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, told the visiting South Korean president Kim Dae-jung that he could support the American military presence as a peacekeeping force in the region, according to South Korean officials who attended their meeting.

“I am quite sure that if relations between North Korea and the United States improve, the North will not demand the withdrawal of American troops in signing the peace treaty,” Lee Jong-seok, a former South Korean unification minister, said during a forum on Wednesday.

‘There Could Be a Partial Withdrawal’

Formally ending the war would not necessarily mean that Mr. Kim would demand that all American troops be removed, said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. “There could be a partial withdrawal,” he said. “Remember, all this maneuvering is going on while the United States and South Korea are conducting joint military exercises.”

Still, Mr. Kim seems likely to demand at least a major reduction in troops, said Hugh White, a senior military strategist who worked at the Australian Department of Defense and is now a professor at Australian National University. One outcome, he said, could be a substantial troop withdrawal in exchange for Mr. Kim’s scrapping his intercontinental ballistic missile program.

Such an agreement could appeal to Mr. Trump with his “America First” perspective, Mr. White said. From that point of view, “it could make sense to withdraw from Korea if in return Kim Jong-un scrapped the ICBM program and thus ceased to threaten the continental United States,” he said.

That, Mr. White noted, would transform the American military presence in Asia. “It would be a big win for China,” he said.SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea confirmed on Wednesday that it had been in talks with American and North Korean officials about negotiating a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War after more than 60 years, as the United States and its ally try to establish a basis for persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons.

Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, said he had discussed the matter with John R. Bolton, his newly appointed American counterpart, in Washington last week, as they prepared for the planned talks between each of their countries’ presidents and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader. South Korean officials said they had also been in talks with the North about a possible treaty.

Mr. Kim told Mr. Chung and another South Korean official last month that the North was willing to give up nuclear arms if it received security guarantees. In the past, the North has said that a peace treaty and the normalization of ties with the United States would be among the security guarantees it would require in exchange for surrendering its nuclear program.

Referring to his meetings with Trump administration officials, Mr. Chung said on Wednesday, “We held in-depth discussions on various ways of how to end hostilities and eventually establish a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula, how to address the North Korean concerns and how to ensure a bright future for the North if it makes the right choice.”HAVANA — Raúl Castro, who took over from his brother Fidel 12 years ago and led Cuba through some of its biggest changes in decades, is expected to step down on Thursday and hand power to someone outside the Castro dynasty for the first time since the Cuban revolution more than half a century ago.

During his two terms as president, Mr. Castro, 86, opened up his Communist country to a small but vital private sector and, perhaps most significantly, diplomatic relations with the United States. It was a notable departure from his brother’s agenda, yet it was possible only because he, too, was a Castro.

His handpicked successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, 57, is a Communist Party loyalist who was born a year after Fidel Castro claimed power in Cuba. His rise ushers in a new generation of Cubans whose only firsthand experience with the revolution has been its aftermath — the early era of plenty, the periods of economic privation after the demise of the Soviet Union, and the fleeting détente in recent years with the United States, its Cold War foe.

Officials started gathering here in Havana on Wednesday morning and put forward Mr. Díaz-Canel as the sole candidate to replace Mr. Castro, all but assuring his selection by the Communist Party.

Though Mr. Díaz-Canel’s path to the top office has been forecast for years, many an heir apparent before him has fallen by the wayside in the search for a successor to lead the country, whether because of party disloyalty, snide remarks or projecting too much power for the Castros’ liking.HAVANA — Raúl Castro, who took over from his brother Fidel 12 years ago and led Cuba through some of its biggest changes in decades, is expected to step down on Thursday and hand power to someone outside the Castro dynasty for the first time since the Cuban revolution more than half a century ago.

“It damages her credibility going forward and once again makes everyone, friend and foe alike, wonder that when the United States says something, approves something, calls for something, opposes something, is it for real?” said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “Should we wait to see what Trump does the next day?”

The clash was reminiscent of various occasions when Mr. Trump has directly undercut subordinates, as when Mr. Tillerson broached the idea of negotiations with North Korea and the president scolded him on Twitter not to waste his time. Many in Washington and at the United Nations were riveted by the sharp exchange on Tuesday between the White House and its senior international diplomat.

“She got ahead of the curve,” Larry Kudlow, the president’s national economics adviser, told reporters at a briefing in Florida before Mr. Trump welcomed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to his Mar-a-Lago estate. “She’s done a great job. She’s a very effective ambassador, but there might have been some momentary confusion about that.”

Ms. Haley took umbrage. A few hours later, she spoke with Dana Perino of Fox News, who quoted her response on air: “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.”

Mr. Kudlow then called Ms. Haley to apologize. “She was certainly not confused,” Mr. Kudlow told The New York Times by telephone. “I was wrong to say that — totally wrong.”

He added: “As it turns out, she was basically following what she thought was policy. The policy was changed and she wasn’t told about it, so she was in a box.”

The argument that Ms. Haley had merely gotten out ahead of a decision was undercut by the fact that the White House itself had sent out word to surrogates on Saturday — the day before her remarks — letting them know that it had already decided to take punitive action against Moscow.

“We also intend to impose specific additional sanctions against Russia to respond to Moscow’s ongoing support for the Assad regime, which has enabled the regime’s atrocities against the Syrian people,” said a document distributed by the Republican National Committee that was titled “White House talking points.”

And yet an administration official said there was a quick recognition on Sunday that Ms. Haley had gone too far in her remarks on “Face the Nation” on CBS.

This official said that the State Department called an aide to Ms. Haley shortly after she appeared on the show, to suggest she issue a correction. Ms. Haley’s aide replied that her office was considering a correction, but none was ever released. Instead, the White House was left to say the next day that no sanctions had been approved.

Such conflicts leave foreign governments in a bind as they try to interpret American moves.

“Coordinated messaging by our government on matters as serious as these is very important, so it is best that an episode such as this one not be repeated,” said John Negroponte, a former ambassador to the United Nations. He added that he was confident that Ms. Haley “has absolutely no interest in undercutting, contradicting or getting out in front of the White House.”

Beyond the immediate disconnect, though, is a deeper strain between Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley, according to administration officials and other insiders. Ms. Haley has been perhaps the most hawkish voice on Russia on a team headed by a president who has emphasized his fervent desire for friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin.

At times, that serves the president’s interests because she can say what he will not. But at other times, he has grown exasperated by her outspokenness.

At one point recently, he saw Ms. Haley on television sharply criticizing Russia over its intervention in Ukraine. “Who wrote that for her?” Mr. Trump yelled angrily at the screen, according to people briefed on the moment. “Who wrote that for her?”

A former governor of South Carolina, Ms. Haley has assumed a more prominent role than most of her predecessors, at times eclipsing the secretary of state. And along the way, Mr. Trump has grown suspicious of her ambition, convinced that she had been angling for Mr. Tillerson’s position and increasingly wondering whether she wants his own job.

Republicans close to the White House whisper about the prospect of an alliance between Ms. Haley and Vice President Mike Pence, possibly to run as a ticket in 2020.

Aides to both scoff at such suggestions, but the slightest hint of such a pairing would be likely to enrage Mr. Trump, who has made it clear that he plans to run for re-election. The talk was exacerbated in recent days when Mr. Pence named Jon Lerner, Ms. Haley’s deputy, as his new national security adviser, while allowing him to keep his job at the United Nations.

That plan collapsed within 48 hours when Mr. Trump grew angry at reports that Mr. Lerner had made anti-Trump ads for the Club for Growth, an economic conservative advocacy group, during Republican primaries in 2016. Mr. Lerner stepped down from the job in Mr. Pence’s office.

Ms. Haley draws strong feelings on both sides of the aisle. In Republican circles, she is a favorite of neoconservatives and national security hawks like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, but viewed skeptically by the more isolationist wing that sees Mr. Trump as a champion. Among Democrats, she has respect from those who see her as a voice of reason and scorn from others who see her as overly combative.

“Nikki Haley is a neocon in her view,” said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California. “Basically, she’s a parrot for the McCain-Lindsey Graham worldview of ‘Let’s go bomb Iran, let’s go fight another cold war with Russia, let’s go use force around the world.’”

Mr. Connolly, on the other hand, described her as an important counterpoint to Mr. Trump. “She’s been a little island of some sanity in this otherwise dysfunctional, irrational, volatile White House when it comes to foreign policy,” he said. “She’s now getting the Tillerson treatment. And so perhaps this island will be swallowed up by rising sea levels.”“The party of war has won within the Russian elite,” said Yuliy A. Nisnevich, a political-science professor. “There are people in the elites who would like the confrontation to stop — these are the people who would like to spend or earn money abroad. But the party of war, the people who get their money inside the country and live here, is prevalent now.”

Russia, of course, professes its innocence on all fronts. It accuses the West of suffering from an advanced case of Russophobia, a longstanding disease that emerges from hibernation whenever Russia begins to “get up off its knees.”

Sergei V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said in a television interview broadcast Tuesday that the last vestiges of trust with the West were evaporating, sinking below even Cold War levels. “There were communication channels during the Cold War, and there was no obsession with Russophobia, which looks like genocide through sanctions,” Mr. Lavrov told the BBC.

From the Western countries’ perspective, however, the mood is one of enough is enough, and they are gradually acting in concert in delivering that message to the Kremlin. Economic sanctions imposed after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, which represented the start of deteriorating relations, have remained intact despite repeated predictions from the Kremlin that one European Union member or another would eventually veto them.

More recently, there was the mass expulsion of some 150 Russian diplomats from Western nations after the chemical poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain in March; harsh United States sanctions against several Russian oligarchs, political figures and companies; and the bombing of Syria by the United States, France and Britain over the weekend.

“There is an upsurge in momentum of the kind we have not seen before,” said James Nixey, the head of the Russian program at the London-based think tank Chatham House. He is not sure it will last, however, with nations like Hungary following the Putin model, while the Baltics and the Scandinavian countries remain far more wary.

In Russia, the population can basically be broken down into three groups, said Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, a Russian scholar currently at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw.

The circle around Putin and the bulk of the population are sure that Russia is doing everything right, while the urban elite, including a majority of the business community, thinks it has gone too far and needs to find a way to reset relations with the West, he said.

The latter group views growing Western consolidation with trepidation, he said, while the Putin court and the majority “believe that quite soon the Western unity will vanish.”

They have a wild card in President Trump. He has long been reluctant to criticize Russia, but his attitude has proved more volatile of late. On Sunday, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said that Washington was about to impose yet more sanctions on Russia, but Mr. Trump rejected the idea on Monday.

There are those who believe that the Russians have some hold over Mr. Trump. That explanation does not have much public currency in Russia, where the attitude swings between humor and exasperation.

If the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar used to fluctuate according to the price of oil, it is now Trump tweets about Russia that send it swinging, goes one joke.

But economists are not laughing about the sanctions imposed by the United States last week. The hardest hit was Rusal, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aluminum, which appeared on the sanctions list and saw its value plummet. Japan just became the latest country to announce that it would halt purchases from the company.

The Russian Parliament expedited a draft of proposed countersanctions last week that ranged from halting the import of medicine from the United States, to cutting off titanium and uranium sales, to allowing the open theft of American intellectual property. A statement by one legislator, Pyotr O. Tolstoy — a descendant of the writer — that Russians would happily drink brewed tree bark instead of using American medicine provoked widespread derision.

On social media, the idea of imposing countersanctions has become known as “bombing Voronezh,” a provincial Russian city, the idea being that such measures invariably hurt Russians.

“We all see that the sanctions standoff is strengthening,” said Mr. Nikolaev, the economist, and the Russian response “might in fact harm us.”

Boeing, for example, buys about 35 percent of its titanium, which is used extensively in the 787 Dreamliner, from VSMPO-Avisma, the state monopoly that controls titanium production. The company warned in a statement that such a measure could adversely affect 20,000 employees and the economy as a whole.

The outcry from businesses over the potential countersanctions was such that Russian Parliament postponed discussion of the measures until May 15 to allow for consultations.

Ultimately, the path is clear, with the upshot of actions from both the West and Russia driving the “deglobalization” of Russia, said Evsey Gurvich, the head of the Expert Economic Group, an independent analytic center. As the West shuns Russia, the country will withdraw more and more to try to protect itself from further sanctions, he said.

This year economic growth will be lower than the 2 percent anticipated, with expert predictions ranging from 1.7 percent to none.

The result, some experts noted, is the state’s taking control over more of the economy as it tries to protect jobs and industries from the fallout from sanctions, driving Russia back toward the Soviet model. In addition, when a big company like Rusal gets hit with sanctions and its revenues plunge, there is less tax revenue for the budget so social services like medicine and education suffer cuts.

It is unclear that there will be domestic political problems for Mr. Putin, however. Real incomes have been falling over the last few years, but he still received overwhelming support in the March presidential election.

No one expects economic issues to change Mr. Putin’s mind about confronting the West either. The upshot is that the Kremlin elite who are winning the internal struggle value geopolitical goals far more than the country’s economic development, experts said.

“When we say that we are not successful and quote economic numbers, they say that they do not care about this,” said Leonid Gozman, a political commentator and former politician.“I grabbed my wife’s hand and I started praying: ‘Dear Jesus, send some angels. Just save us from this,’” said Timothy C. Bourman, 36, a pastor from Woodside, N.Y., who was on his way to a church retreat in San Antonio. “I thought we were goners.”

In the cockpit, the pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, a veteran Navy pilot, flew on with one engine and calmly radioed air traffic controllers in Philadelphia to discuss her approach. She told them the flight was carrying injured passengers and needed emergency medics on the ground.

“Is your airplane physically on fire?” an air traffic controller asked Ms. Shults, according to audio captured by LiveATC.

“No it’s not on fire, but part of it is missing,” she responded. “They said there’s a hole and someone went out.”

On Wednesday, Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said there was evidence of metal fatigue on the left engine of the plane, a two-engine Boeing 737. Mr. Sumwalt also said that investigators had discovered that a fan blade was missing from the plane’s other engine.

Robert W. Mann, an airline analyst, said this kind of metal fatigue is virtually impossible to see until a failure has already occurred. It is always destructive when a blade comes loose, although it is unusual for uncontained engine failures to be deadly, he said.

On Tuesday morning, as the flight descended toward Philadelphia, some passengers scrambled to put on oxygen masks while others hurried to buy internet access so they could send a last message to their children and families. Marty Martinez, 29, of Dallas, held a yellow oxygen mask to his face as he live-streamed the descent on Facebook. “It appears we are going down!” he wrote.

Pastor Bourman said he could not figure out how to use his mask, and decided it would not save him if the plane crashed. Instead, he sat and prayed as his wife, Amanda, managed to connect her phone to the plane’s Wi-Fi. They began texting Pastor Bourman’s father to tell him what had happened and to convey a message to the couple’s three daughters, 6, 4 and 2 years old:

Pray.

Plane blew an engine.

We are going to try to land.

Tell the girls we love them and that Jesus is with them always.

On the right side of the plane, just across from the blown-out window, Sheri Sears said her friend and travel companion, Tim McGinty, reassured his wife and Ms. Sears that they would be fine, and tightened their seatbelts. Then he sprang up to help drag the injured passenger, Jennifer Riordan, back into the plane.

Ms. Riordan was unconscious and bleeding as Mr. McGinty and another passenger, a firefighter from north of Dallas, laid her across a row of seats. A retired nurse rushed up and helped Mr. McGinty perform CPR all the way to Philadelphia, but it was no use. Ms. Riordan, a Wells Fargo executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, was pronounced dead at a hospital.

As the passengers tried to save Ms. Riordan, Ms. Sears thought about her 11-year-old daughter, Tyley. Ms. Sears’s own father had died when she was 7, and she kept thinking to herself: I’m not going to be there for her.

She said she offered a thin prayer for mercy: “If this is your will, God, please let me go quickly. Don’t let me suffer.”In the seats behind her, passengers sent goodbye text messages to loved ones, tightened oxygen masks around their faces and braced for impact. Flight attendants frantically performed CPR on the critically injured passenger, who later died at a hospital.

But Captain Shults, 56, was in control. She learned to fly as one of the first female fighter pilots in the Navy three decades ago, piloting the F/A-18 Hornet in an era when women were barred from combat missions.

“Can you have the medical meet us there on the runway,” Captain Shults calmly told air traffic controllers in Philadelphia. “They said there’s a hole and, uh, someone went out.”

At 11:20 a.m., Captain Shults steered the plane, a two-engine Boeing 737, to a smooth landing on Runway 27L at Philadelphia International Airport. The left engine looked as if it had been ripped apart.

“This is a true American hero,” Diana McBride Self, a passenger, wrote in a Facebook post. “A huge thank you for her knowledge, guidance and bravery in a traumatic situation. God bless her and all the crew.”

Another passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, was more direct in his praise. “She has nerves of steel,” Mr. Tumlinson told The Associated Press. “I’m going to send her a Christmas card — I’m going to tell you that — with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”

While women still make up a small percentage of commercial pilots, Captain Shults took up flying when there were far fewer in the industry and when women were often told to find other careers. In her junior year at MidAmerica Nazarene University in Olathe, Kan., she attended an Air Force event and spotted a woman in a piloting class, she told an alumni publication.

She graduated from MidAmerica in 1983 with a bachelor’s degree in biology and agribusiness and then set off to join the military, the university said on Wednesday. The Air Force would not accept her, she told the publication, but the Navy would. She enrolled in Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla., in 1985 — the start of a decade of groundbreaking service.

“We can confirm that Lt. Commander Shults was among the first cohort of women pilots to transition to tactical aircraft,” the Navy said in a statement on Wednesday.

She flew the F/A-18 Hornet, the twin-engine supersonic fighter jet and bomber. After flight school, in 1989, she was assigned to the Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 34 in Point Mugu, Calif. During the Gulf War, her squadron was led by the first female air commander in the Navy.

But despite her accomplishments, she came up against the limits placed on women in the military. She left active service on March 31, 1993 — two days before the Navy asked the Clinton administration to open combat assignments to women. She then spent about a year in reserves before leaving the military in 1994, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.

Captain Shults later became a pilot with Southwest Airlines, as did her husband, Dean M. Shults. Southwest Airlines declined to comment about her on Wednesday.

After her name started to appear in news reports on Tuesday, fellow female fighter pilots started to message one another about Captain Shults. Christine Westrich, who flew the F/A-18 in the Marine Corps in the late 1990s, said she was struck by her service.

“She is undoubtedly a pioneer, being a Hornet driver well before the combat exclusion law was lifted,” Ms. Westrich said in an interview. “She kicks ass in my book.”

Captain Shults later became a pilot with Southwest Airlines, as did her husband, Dean M. Shults. Southwest Airlines declined to comment about her on Wednesday.

After her name started to appear in news reports on Tuesday, fellow female fighter pilots started to message one another about Captain Shults. Christine Westrich, who flew the F/A-18 in the Marine Corps in the late 1990s, said she was struck by her service.

“She is undoubtedly a pioneer, being a Hornet driver well before the combat exclusion law was lifted,” Ms. Westrich said in an interview. “She kicks ass in my book.”

The power authority had boasted earlier in the day that electricity had been restored to 97 percent of its nearly 1.5 million clients. Three hours later, nearly 100 percent were without power.

The outage reflects the troubled nature of the power restoration in Puerto Rico, where thousands of electrical workers from throughout the United States worked for months installing poles, transformers and electrical wire. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has spent $2.1 billion on restoring power on the island, where 80 percent of the distribution lines were damaged during the hurricane. Declaring its mission nearly complete, the Corps had already begun demobilizing the majority of the contractors on the island.

On Wednesday, the Puerto Rico electrical authority said it still had over 2,000 workers fixing distribution and transmission lines.

The company did not say what caused the failure, which originated at its Aguirre Central plant. The company said it expected it would take 24 to 36 hours to restore power, beginning with critical locations such as hospitals and the airport.

“The priority to restore services are the critical loads such as the hospitals, the Luis Muñoz Marín airport, the water pumping stations, and banking centers,” the company said on Twitter. “Then comes industries, commercial businesses and residences.”

Angel Figueroa Jaramillo, the head of the electrical worker’s union in Puerto Rico, said the electric company was letting the restoration efforts collapse in a deliberate attempt to justify privatizing the electric company. Gov. Ricardo Rosselló has said he plans to privatize the company, known as Prepa, which is in bankruptcy and has suffered from years of neglect and lack of maintenance.

“In addition to the $2.4 billion that has been spent, we continue paying the consequences,” Mr. Figueroa said at a televised news conference on Wednesday. “People who came here with business in mind did what they could, quote unquote ‘finished,’ and then left. This is all a process on how to dismantle the electric authority to justify privatization of the most important service in our country.”

Mr. González said that notion was ridiculous. Power authority officials have said they brought in a wealth of assistance and have been working hard to get power restored, but were hampered at the beginning by a lack of supplies and inaccessible terrain.

Sitting in the main outdoors plaza at the Centro Médico, Juan de Jiménez Quiñones, 55, smoked a cigarette. He was at work, as a plasterer elsewhere in San Juan, earlier in the day when he found out the electricity was out — yet again — on the island.

A few feet away, a security guard screened the line. Even here, the buzz of the generators could be heard. “Oh, God help us,” said a man from outside the sliding glass doors.

Ms. Ortega never disputed that she killed Leo Krim, 2, and his sister Lucia, 6, in the bathroom of their family’s Upper West Side apartment at 57 West 75th Street on Oct. 25, 2012.

The children’s mother, Marina Krim, with her middle child in tow, came home around 5:30 p.m. and discovered the two children lying lifeless in the tub, stabbed multiple times with a kitchen knife, with Ms. Ortega standing near them. As Ms. Krim opened the bathroom door, Ms. Ortega stabbed herself in the neck.

Prosecutors argued that Ms. Ortega intended to kill the children, then commit suicide, because she was depressed and angry at Ms. Krim over her workload and schedule.

The defense, however, said that Ms. Ortega was severely mentally ill and heard voices, including Satan’s, telling her to kill the children. Her lawyer, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg, presented evidence that Ms. Ortega had experienced delusions and hallucinations since she was a teenager in the Dominican Republic but that her psychosis had gone untreated and undiagnosed until after her arrest.

Jurors heard from mental-health experts on both sides, who arrived at different conclusions about Ms. Ortega’s state of mind at the time of the killings.

Two psychiatrists for the defense, Karen B. Rosenbaum and Phillip J. Resnick, said that Ms. Ortega was in the grip of a psychotic break so severe that she did not understand her actions or know they were wrong. After interviewing her family members and scouring her medical records, they came to the conclusion that she had been overcome by voices in her head — one of which she thought belonged to Satan — in the weeks before the murders. She could not even remember the gruesome killings, they said.

But a forensic psychologist for the prosecution, Ali Khadivi, testified that while Ms. Ortega suffered from anxiety and depression, she was not psychotic. He determined that she was not experiencing paranoia, delusions or any break from reality the day of the killings. To buttress his conclusion, prosecutors showed a 2016 videotape on which Ms. Ortega repeatedly denied to Mr. Khadivi that she heard voices commanding her to kill the children, contradicting what she had told defense psychiatrists several months after the killings.

Video

The prosecutors, Stuart Silberg and Courtney Groves, also focused on evidence suggesting that Ms. Ortega had planned the murders. That day, she had left a purse containing her valuables, identification cards and keepsakes for her son and an envelope of important personal documents for her sister Delci Ortega. She had also recently pleaded with Delci to take care of her teenage son and “raise him well.”

Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg, however, noted that Ms. Ortega had expressed to several family members how much she loved the Krim children, and suggested to jurors that the only possible explanation for such an atrocity was severe mental illness.

Jurors heard six weeks of testimony from 53 witnesses, including the wrenching accounts of Ms. Krim, who described discovering the horrific scene in the bathroom, and her husband, Mr. Krim, who spoke of his deep anger that members of Ms. Ortega’s family had lied to him and his wife about Ms. Ortega’s qualifications and background. Both said they had noticed that Ms. Ortega was upset in the weeks before the murders but saw no indication she was losing her mind.

Before her arrest, Ms. Ortega had never been hospitalized for psychiatric problems; the only medical record regarding her mental health consisted of one page of notes from a psychologist she visited three days before the crime. The therapist, Thomas Caffrey, said he saw no signs of delusional or psychotic thinking. He determined she was suffering from depression and anxiety. “She didn’t tell me about any concerns about voices or visions,” he testified.

Lacking medical records, the defense team relied on testimony from Ms. Ortega’s family members and friends to show that she had had two mental breakdowns in the Dominican Republic, one in 1978 after her young sister died and a second in 2008 after a close family friend committed suicide.

In both cases, she slipped into deep depression and refused to leave her family’s house, her sisters and friends said. In 1978, she received treatment from a doctor and recovered. During the second episode, witnesses said she started expressing irrational fears about people coming to get her and returned to New York City.

Ms. Ortega’s siblings and other family members also testified that she appeared to be unraveling in the six months before the killings, crying frequently, asking people to pray for her and speaking of “shadows” and a “black man” following her and attempting to split up her family.

Her mental turmoil started when one of her sisters, Miladys Garcia, asked her to move out of the family’s apartment in Hamilton Heights, the witnesses said. She moved to an apartment in the Bronx belonging to another relative and insisted her teenage son, Jesus Frias, be sent from the Dominican Republic to live with her. She had left Mr. Frias with Ms. Garcia when he was 4 years old and had not raised him herself, except for an 18-month period around 2008.

Three days before the murders, she woke up in the middle of the night and started throwing pots and pans around the kitchen, then claimed later not to remember it, her sister Delci said.

Just four hours before the killings, Ms. Ortega visited a neighbor’s apartment and, agitated and pacing up and down, told a teenage woman staying there, Jennifer Reynosa, that she saw a “black shadow” that spoke to her. In more than a dozen interviews in the months after the murders, Ms. Ortega told Dr. Rosenbaum that she had been hearing voices, including Satan’s, telling her to kill herself and her employers’ children.

Prosecutors, however, focused on the statements Ms. Ortega made to Mr. Caffrey, the therapist, three days before the killings and to Dr. Marc Dubin, a psychiatrist who spoke to her 11 days after the horrific event as she was recovering from her neck wound at NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center.

In both interviews, Ms. Ortega complained about money trouble and expressed frustration with Ms. Krim about her schedule and workload, but did not mention hearing voices commanding her to kill.

She first reported hearing those voices over the next month as her health improved and her post-surgery delirium lifted. Her family members did not initially mention her psychotic symptoms to the police, but did so in later conversations with Dr. Rosenbaum and Dr. Resnick.

In closing arguments, the lead prosecutor, Stuart Silberg, suggested that Ms. Ortega had made up stories about hearing commands from the Devil to avoid a life sentence, and that her relatives had invented stories about her delusions for similar reasons.

But Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg said that Ms. Ortega and her family members at first hid the symptoms of her disease because of the stigma attached to mental illness in the Dominican Republic.

She suggested that Ms. Ortega had lost the battle with the demonic voices in her head, experienced a break with reality and did not know what she was doing.

“Her mind and her body separated,” she said.Mexico City, by contrast, looked to its indigenous past for national icons.

We discover many of these statues in hazy prints of silver and sepia, and indeed this is as much an exhibition of early photography as it is of architecture and urban planning. By 1900, shutterbugs in these Latin American capitals were snapping plush urban parks in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, spaces of leisure for the new bourgeoisie. Both of these cities received radical makeovers at this time, with ostentatious, oversized thoroughfares built on the Parisian model. An unnamed photographer’s family pictures capture Buenos Aires’s lordly Avenida de Mayo, a boulevard built in commemoration of Argentine independence and in palpable imitation of Baron Haussmann’s extended axes.

And as for the vintage photographs of Rio, it is hard to look without desperate jealousy. The most beautiful city on the planet appears, by some measure, as the most sophisticated of the six capitals examined in this exhibition, though the photographers and mapmakers here had far more interest in Rio’s boulevards and gardens than its favelas, the first of which arose in the 1890s.

In two exquisite photographic panoramas by the Brazilian photographer Marc Ferrez, dating to around 1895, Sugarloaf Mountain looms gently over Botafogo and Flamengo — the boulevards and alleys of the capital in seductive harmony with the beach and the hillside. Ferrez also shot Rio’s ritzy cinemas and lush botanical gardens, as well as new infrastructure. A tramway cuts through the underbrush to Corcovado, the verdant peak that would soon be topped by the statue of Christ the Redeemer.

Eventually a new generation of Latin American architects and urban designers, less hung up on European models, would transform these capitals once again. There is a hint of what’s to come in a 1927 photograph of Rio’s Praça Marechal Floriano, with undulating mosaics of white and black designed by Roberto Burle Marx. Burle Marx would go on to landscape a new capital, Brasília, that would take national ambition to new extremes. Buenos Aires would invite Le Corbusier, the Swiss apostle of towerblocks and bulldozers, to reimagine the Argentine capital from scratch. Cuba would take a different approach to national reinvention, one that, ironically, has left much of Havana’s earlier architecture deteriorating but in place.

Latin American cities would become spaces of utopian fantasies, frequently followed by political nightmares. But before the new towers arrived — and before, more recently, Rio’s white-elephant Olympic stadiums and Mexico City’s big-money museums — they were already cities of dreams.Mexico City, by contrast, looked to its indigenous past for national icons.

Our recent back story on the dispute over who was first to reach the North Pole mentioned Adm. Robert Peary’s expedition in 1909.

What it didn’t mention were the people with him, specifically Matthew Henson, who was originally hired as Peary’s valet but became an invaluable navigator and interpreter.

In the decades after the expedition, the roles of Henson and the party’s four Inuit members — Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah — were played down.

Henson, who was African-American, was working at store in Washington when he met Peary, above. Their partnership lasted through eight Arctic expeditions over 22 years. Peary admitted: “I can’t get along without him.”

Henson was the first to plant the American flag when Peary’s group believed it had reached the North Pole.

Henson died in obscurity in 1955 at the age of 88. In 1988, he was reburied in Arlington National Cemetery next to Peary.

At the re-internment, S. Allen Counter, who campaigned to have Henson recognized, said: “We are assembled here today to right a tragic wrong, to right the record.”

A housing proposal that is dividing neighborhoods and political leaders — state legislation that would override local zoning laws to build dense housing projects near transit lines — has become a top issue in the race for governor. The bill, sponsored by Senator Scott Wiener, was defeated Tuesday by a Senate committee, but Mr. Wiener vows he will bring it back. Two Democratic candidates for governor, Antonio Villaraigosa and Gavin Newsom, have said they won’t sign it. Mr. Wiener talked to us about his bill before the vote; the interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

A: I absolutely did not see that coming, in terms of every candidate for governor having to take a position on it, having it come up every debate. We knew it was going to be a controversial bill. There is so much pent-up frustration around housing in the state that, in retrospect, it’s not surprising that this touched a nerve.

A small group of activists and clergy members met with Howard Schultz, the company’s executive chairman, and the Philadelphia district attorney for about an hour on Tuesday afternoon.

Though most of the attention is being directed toward Starbucks, some activists, politicians and policy experts place the blame for the incident on a system of law enforcement that is disproportionately harsh toward black people.

“I think the cops’ behavior was not only outrageous, but it was par for the course,” said Rashad Robinson, the director of Color of Change, a racial justice organization. “It’s what happens day in and day out in communities around the country.”

But the case also raises tricky questions of law enforcement policies and practices, like when officers should make arrests instead of using other methods to resolve nonviolent disputes.

A manager at the Starbucks cafe called the police, saying that the two men were sitting in the store without purchasing anything and that they had refused to leave.

The eight-minute video clip of the encounter shows three officers in bicycle helmets standing around two black men, who were sitting and calmly responding to the officers’ questions. One of the men told the police that they had a meeting, and the officer told him, “I’ll give you one more chance” to leave.

A few minutes go by, with the officers and the men continuing to exchange words, when a white man who was supposed to meet the men showed up. He began arguing with the officers, saying that they were discriminating against the two black men. Eventually, the white man said they would just go somewhere else, but the officer responded, “They’re not free to leave,” adding that they had already failed to comply.

A short time later the two black men were placed in handcuffs and taken to the police station to be booked.

Initially, the city’s police commissioner, Richard Ross, emphasized that the officers who made the arrest “followed policy, they did what they were supposed to do, they were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen — and instead they got the opposite back.”

But in an interview with a local television station on Monday, the commissioner struck a more conciliatory note and admitted that he wished that Starbucks had never called the police.

“The whole thing is unfortunate,” Commissioner Ross told WPVI, an ABC affiliate. “Wish it hadn’t happened, from start to finish.”

Though he defended the officers and said that it appeared they had not done anything wrong, the commissioner said that the department was now reviewing its procedures. “If we had our druthers, we wouldn’t have came there in the first place,” he said.

Policing experts said that while it was not clear the officers did anything in violation of the law or police policy, the emphasis at many departments would have been on trying to avoid any incident like the one that played out.

Audio of the 911 and dispatch calls, released on Tuesday, also raised questions about how those calls may have affected the officers as they responded to the call.

“Hi, I have two gentlemen in my cafe that are refusing to make a purchase or leave,” said the Starbucks employee who called 911.

But when the dispatcher put out the call to the police, he said: “We’ve got a disturbance there. A group of males refusing to leave.”

Ronal Serpas, a former police chief in New Orleans and Nashville, said it was “troublesome that an arrest occurred,” given the tremendous discretion officers have to handle such situations.

“Using every available alternative to a physical arrest, within department policy, should be the goal in a case like this,” said Mr. Serpas, who is now a professor at Loyola University New Orleans.

Jim Bueermann, the president of the Police Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization, said that the incident reflected a systemic problem with how the police deal with such episodes.

“This is a very typical example of the difficult place police officers find themselves in every day, where a business is on one side, saying, ‘We want you to enforce the law, because these people are being uncooperative and are technically violating the law,’ ” Mr. Bueermann said. “And on the other side, officers are trying to be sensitive because of the nature of the situation and everyone involved.”

This city has struggled for years to curb discriminatory police stops. The police department entered into a consent decree with the A.C.L.U. after the organization sued the city in 2010.

Since the election two years ago of Mayor Jim Kenney, who campaigned partly on an agenda of curbing unjustified police stops, the total number of pedestrian stops has fallen by half. The proportion of unjustified stops has also dropped sharply, according to Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director of the Pennsylvania A.C.L.U., crediting the mayor’s efforts.

But the racial disparity in pedestrian stops has not budged, and one in five stops are still made without any justification, she said.

Black residents say that those stops are acutely felt in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in the center of the city, the site of the now infamous Starbucks. The area was quiet on Tuesday afternoon. A few birds chirped in the cold. Tulip tree blossoms crowned in pink the park that is at the center of the neighborhood.

The neighborhood was the part of town where African-Americans were driven out because of riots started by white residents in the mid 1800s, according to Marcus Anthony Hunter, the chairman of the Department of African-American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. The rise of housing projects, and later urban renewal, eventually led to a decrease in the black population, he said. And over the past 20 years, the neighborhood has become almost all white because of gentrification.

Linda Richardson, a 71-year-old black woman, lived just off Rittenhouse Square in 1967, with her white husband and their young daughter, when the neighborhood had become majority white. People often mistook her for her daughter’s nanny. Even back then, she said, she remembered that little black boys who wanted to play in the square were often asked to leave.In fact, statistics show that Rittenhouse Square, with its hotels, boutique museums and upscale shops, has the highest racial disparity in the city when it comes to police pedestrian stops. Although black people account for just 3 percent of the residents in that police subdistrict, they made up two-thirds of the people stopped by the police in the first half of 2017, according to figures collected by the American Civil Liberties Union.

“It is clear that African-Americans are not welcomed in that part of the neighborhood, period,” said Jordan A. Harris, a representative in the state house and chairman of the state’s legislative black caucus.

On Tuesday, Starbucks, whose chief executive, Kevin Johnson, has apologized for the incident, said it would close more than 8,000 of its stores on May 29 to conduct anti-racial bias training for nearly 175,000 employees.

The tokens are generally structured like Bitcoin, using a so-called blockchain to record transactions. The coins are usually designed to be used as an internal payment method in software that the start-ups are building. Over the last year, companies have raised over $6 billion through I.C.O.s.

The New York Times Explains...

Coin offerings generally avoid the regulatory oversight that accompanies traditional fund-raising methods, opening the door for significant fraud. A number of coin offerings have been shut down by law enforcement, and there are several broad investigations of the industry by regulators around the world.

“There are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into,” said Tim Swanson, a consultant to companies in the industry, who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offering.

A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Cambridge Analytica began working with coin offerings in the middle of last year. The business was guided by Ms. Kaiser, an American who led the company’s business development and previously appeared at a press event with organizers of the “Brexit” campaign to get Britain out of the European Union.

Cambridge Analytica boasts that its “psychographic profiles” of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising. In marketing material sent to investors, the firm said Ms. Kaiser was “helping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token sales.”

Jill Carlson, a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies, attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies, including one that Mr. Nix attended.

Ms. Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like Facebook.

She also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns. The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in far-flung regions of Mexico. The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidates.

Ms. Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like Bitcoin.

“The way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it, they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals, which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way,” she said.

Cambridge Analytica did win over some clients. Last summer, Ms. Kaiser’s team began working with Dragon Coin, a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers. The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau, an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structures.

Cambridge Analytica had little public role in promoting Dragon Coin. But behind the scenes the company emailed potential partners and investors and arranged for some of them to take all-expenses-paid trips to a glitzy Dragon Coin event in Macau.

The South China Morning Post published a photo from the event showing Wan Kuok-koi in attendance. Mr. Wan is known as Broken Tooth Koi from his days as the leader of the famous 14K gang in Macau. He was released from prison in 2012 after serving a 14-year term.

The founder of Dragon Coin, Chris Ahmad, told Business Insider at the time that Mr. Wan “is not involved in Dragon, and he is not financing Dragon in any way.”

Photo

But documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coin’s co-founder Paul Moynan listed Mr. Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture. Ms. Kaiser was included in the email. A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr. Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr. Wan as one of a few high-profile supporters of the project.

When reached recently, Mr. Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents. He later said the documents were a “hypothetical wish list” of a “junior staff” member.

“We will be conducting an internal investigation, as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships,” he said.

Ms. Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity, and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr. Wan was not involved with the project.

Dragon Coin claimed it raised more than $300 million from investors last fall. That total has been hard to verify. Like many coin offerings, Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promises.

The document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network. A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved, as is necessary for a card to be issued.

The documents last summer also said the Dragon app, which would let investors use its virtual coin, would be available in September. When that didn’t happen, the company promised the app in January — but it still has not appeared. In the meantime, the company has spent its money sponsoring a Formula E car racing team and a team climbing Mount Everest.

The setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm. The company’s New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners, emails show. And in January, Ms. Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects, known as CryptoHQ, at the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Nix spoke on a panel at the event.

He said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of — the abuse of online personal data.

“We’re going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data,” Mr. Nix said, according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account. “And that is only possible through the blockchain.”

The virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem, and would have also helped the company raise money from investors.

The company wrote a document describing the technical specifications of the coin, Ms. Kaiser said. Her account was confirmed by another person who worked on the project and agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. The work was overseen by Alexander Tayler, the firm’s chief data scientist and briefly the interim chief executive after Mr. Nix stepped down.

Ms. Kaiser left Cambridge Analytica in February and has been sharply critical of the company since then. As far as she knows, the coin offering has not moved forward.

But she is still working on similar concepts at her new consulting firm, Bueno Capital.“You fulfill your programmatic ideas and then you do everything you can to find the funding to make that happen,” Mr. Hollein said in an interview at the Met.

A ‘Think Big’ Coach

This ability to strike a balance between art and business was a skill Mr. Hollein learned from Mr. Krens at the Guggenheim.

Mr. Hollein met Mr. Krens through his father, the prominent postmodern architect Hans Hollein, whom the Guggenheim had tapped for a branch in Salzburg that ultimately never materialized.

“You became part of the family,” Mr. Krens said. “We had a close relationship.”

Growing up in a creative household (his mother Helene was a fashion designer), Mr. Hollein became conversant in the art world and interacted with leading figures like Joseph Beuys and Claes Oldenburg. When Andy Warhol went to Vienna in the 1980s for a show of his late large-scale silk-screens, 12-year-old Max got the artist to sign every single page of Warhol’s exhibition catalog.

“Contemporary artists for other students were these out-of-this-world figures,” Mr. Hollein said. “For me, it was a friends and family background.”

When Max had to do a report on an artist at school, other students chose subjects like van Gogh and Monet; Mr. Hollein said he chose Naum Gabo, the Russian avant-garde sculptor.

“My parents would have loved me to be an artist,” he added, “but I had no talent for that or inclination.”

Mr. Hollein’s sister, Lilli Hollein, the director of Vienna Design Week, said her brother’s business instincts were apparent early on. “He once developed a game that had an economic background,” she said. “It was played with farm animals and people, and you had to buy cattle and stuff and then sell it.”

At the University of Vienna he studied under Konrad Oberhuber, an eminent scholar of drawings, and Hermann Fillitz, who directed Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum — but also, “as a revolution against my parents,” studied business.

When Max was 21, he came to New York to work as an intern at the Guggenheim and Mr. Krens invited him to return for a job after completing his education. He ultimately became Mr. Krens’s chief of staff and executive assistant, working closely on projects like the Guggenheim branch designed by Frank Gehry in Bilbao, Spain.

“The reason that Max is so multifaceted and has had so many great opportunities in life has a lot to do with Tom Krens,” said Lisa Dennison, chairman of Sotheby’s Americas division, and a former director of the Guggenheim, who overlapped with Mr. Hollein. “Tom gave Max opportunities — he was building museums, he was thinking about technology and he told Max to think big.”

After five-and-a-half years at the Guggenheim, Mr. Hollein told Mr. Krens, “I have to leave here because I risk becoming a copy of you.”

What he took from Mr. Krens, Mr. Hollein said, was that he could push an ambitious agenda until the pieces fell into place and naysayers came around.

“One must not forget the success of Bilbao,” Mr. Hollein said, by way of example. “Two years before it opened there were large amounts of people who thought it would be a huge failure.”

Returning to Europe, Mr. Hollein imported the strategies and techniques he’d learned in New York. “He has this mixture of the European and the American know-how, and that’s a very rare thing,” said Renée Price, the director of the Neue Galerie and a fellow Vienna native.

In 2001, after impressing Frankfurt’s mayor, Petra Roth, at a dinner in New York, Mr. Hollein was named director of that city’s Schirn Kunsthalle, a non-collecting institution with such low attendance that local politicians were arguing for its closure.

Mr. Hollein quickly whipped it into shape, and was savvy about sponsorships, getting private corporations to help pay for exhibitions of Yves Klein and Pablo Picasso.

Attendance surged, and hipsters in Berlin began to take note of the upheaval underway in sleepy, big-money Frankfurt. By 2010, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit had called the Schirn “the most exciting exhibition hall in Germany.”

Ambitions Beyond the Rhine

Mr. Hollein was soon invited by trustees to take the director’s post at the Städel foundation, a more venerable institution, and home to one of Germany’s best collections of medieval, Renaissance and Baroque painting. He agreed to take the post, as well as the directorship of the neighboring Liebieghaus sculpture museum under a surprising condition: that he keep the Schirn as well.

This struck some as a power grab, and in Germany, a country whose citizens stick their academic titles on every surface, Mr. Hollein’s lack of a doctorate in art history caused additional concern.

Eventually, Mr. Hollein’s efforts began to speak for themselves. At the Städel, he helped expand the collection to include 20th- and 21st-century art by brokering unusual long-term loans with two German banks — Deutsche Bank and DZ Bank AG — that allowed the museum to retain the works in perpetuity.

Exhibitions of Cranach, Botticelli and Monet attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors. An ambitious digital program — including art history video lectures in German and English — brought international attention to what was once a museum of only regional influence.

And at both museums, Mr. Hollein indulged his abiding passion for electronic music. At the Schirn, he backed exhibitions featuring experimental composers like Carsten Nicolai and Ryoji Ikeda; at the Städel, during a 2012 exhibition of Romantic and Symbolist painting, he invited the public to dance until 2 a.m. to D.J.s from the Berlin nightclub circuit.

Mr. Hollein’s progress gained attention on the other side of the Rhine. In 2013, he emerged as the odds-on favorite to become director of France’s leading modern art museum, the Pompidou Center in Paris.

“Max, in Frankfurt, had been committed to very strong temporary exhibitions — blockbuster shows as well as more scholarly, researched, niche shows,” said Alain Seban, who was the Pompidou’s president from 2007 to 2015. He praised Mr. Hollein’s “capability to make the whole curatorial team participate in an exhibition strategy for the museum. And perhaps, considering the current situation of the Met, it’s something that he might have to do there as well.”

Mr. Seban would continue to hold the top job — a situation that closely parallels Mr. Hollein’s new arrangement at the Met, where he will report to Daniel H. Weiss, the Met’s president and chief executive.

Yet leaks to the French press damaged his Pompidou candidacy, particularly reports that his requested salary was three times higher than expected. Mr. Hollein withdrew before the final selection. (The job went to Bernard Blistène, a Pompidou veteran.)

In his Met interview, Mr. Hollein said he felt that the French government couldn’t give him the freedom he needed to make significant strides.

“I draw a lot of energy where I feel I can move the institution forward,” he said, adding: “It clearly was not the money.”

Some people in the art world were surprised to see Mr. Hollein take the job in San Francisco, in part because of its powerful board president, Diane B. Wilsey, who has a reputation for being loath to relinquish control of the Fine Arts Museums.

Ms. Wilsey, 74, ceded the chief executive title after the museums paid a $2 million settlement to a former high-ranking executive who said Ms. Wilsey had her ousted for revealing alleged museum misspending.

But both Mr. Hollein and Ms. Wilsey said they have had a very productive working relationship. “He pushes the staff, but they like it,” Ms. Wilsey said in a telephone interview. “They’re energized by his energy and intelligence and ambitions.”

Indeed, Mr. Hollein managed to make an impact during his short tenure at the museum, balancing the budget and initiating shows like “Contemporary Muslim Fashions,” which is set to open in September. (Breitbart News Daily questioned whether it was “a celebration of subjugation.”)“You fulfill your programmatic ideas and then you do everything you can to find the funding to make that happen,” Mr. Hollein said in an interview at the Met.

A ‘Think Big’ Coach

This ability to strike a balance between art and business was a skill Mr. Hollein learned from Mr. Krens at the Guggenheim.

Mr. Hollein met Mr. Krens through his father, the prominent postmodern architect Hans Hollein, whom the Guggenheim had tapped for a branch in Salzburg that ultimately never materialized.

“You became part of the family,” Mr. Krens said. “We had a close relationship.”

Growing up in a creative household (his mother Helene was a fashion designer), Mr. Hollein became conversant in the art world and interacted with leading figures like Joseph Beuys and Claes Oldenburg. When Andy Warhol went to Vienna in the 1980s for a show of his late large-scale silk-screens, 12-year-old Max got the artist to sign every single page of Warhol’s exhibition catalog.

“Contemporary artists for other students were these out-of-this-world figures,” Mr. Hollein said. “For me, it was a friends and family background.”

When Max had to do a report on an artist at school, other students chose subjects like van Gogh and Monet; Mr. Hollein said he chose Naum Gabo, the Russian avant-garde sculptor.

“My parents would have loved me to be an artist,” he added, “but I had no talent for that or inclination.”

Mr. Hollein’s sister, Lilli Hollein, the director of Vienna Design Week, said her brother’s business instincts were apparent early on. “He once developed a game that had an economic background,” she said. “It was played with farm animals and people, and you had to buy cattle and stuff and then sell it.”

At the University of Vienna he studied under Konrad Oberhuber, an eminent scholar of drawings, and Hermann Fillitz, who directed Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum — but also, “as a revolution against my parents,” studied business.

When Max was 21, he came to New York to work as an intern at the Guggenheim and Mr. Krens invited him to return for a job after completing his education. He ultimately became Mr. Krens’s chief of staff and executive assistant, working closely on projects like the Guggenheim branch designed by Frank Gehry in Bilbao, Spain.

“The reason that Max is so multifaceted and has had so many great opportunities in life has a lot to do with Tom Krens,” said Lisa Dennison, chairman of Sotheby’s Americas division, and a former director of the Guggenheim, who overlapped with Mr. Hollein. “Tom gave Max opportunities — he was building museums, he was thinking about technology and he told Max to think big.”

After five-and-a-half years at the Guggenheim, Mr. Hollein told Mr. Krens, “I have to leave here because I risk becoming a copy of you.”

What he took from Mr. Krens, Mr. Hollein said, was that he could push an ambitious agenda until the pieces fell into place and naysayers came around.

“One must not forget the success of Bilbao,” Mr. Hollein said, by way of example. “Two years before it opened there were large amounts of people who thought it would be a huge failure.”

Returning to Europe, Mr. Hollein imported the strategies and techniques he’d learned in New York. “He has this mixture of the European and the American know-how, and that’s a very rare thing,” said Renée Price, the director of the Neue Galerie and a fellow Vienna native.

In 2001, after impressing Frankfurt’s mayor, Petra Roth, at a dinner in New York, Mr. Hollein was named director of that city’s Schirn Kunsthalle, a non-collecting institution with such low attendance that local politicians were arguing for its closure.

Mr. Hollein quickly whipped it into shape, and was savvy about sponsorships, getting private corporations to help pay for exhibitions of Yves Klein and Pablo Picasso.

Attendance surged, and hipsters in Berlin began to take note of the upheaval underway in sleepy, big-money Frankfurt. By 2010, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit had called the Schirn “the most exciting exhibition hall in Germany.”

Ambitions Beyond the Rhine

Mr. Hollein was soon invited by trustees to take the director’s post at the Städel foundation, a more venerable institution, and home to one of Germany’s best collections of medieval, Renaissance and Baroque painting. He agreed to take the post, as well as the directorship of the neighboring Liebieghaus sculpture museum under a surprising condition: that he keep the Schirn as well.

This struck some as a power grab, and in Germany, a country whose citizens stick their academic titles on every surface, Mr. Hollein’s lack of a doctorate in art history caused additional concern.

Eventually, Mr. Hollein’s efforts began to speak for themselves.

(Breitbart News Daily questioned whether it was “a celebration of subjugation.”)Jason Sherwin and Jordan Muraskin, the co-founders of deCervo, were only in town for two days. Their sort of expertise is not easily replaceable. The club paid $2,000 to fly them to Arizona. As the ballplayers tapped on their keyboards, and Manny waited on the couch, Sherwin and Muraskin shushed about, adjusting the hairnets. They chatted idly with Frank about the upcoming fantasy football season, but there were giveaways that they were not members of a typical athletic entourage.

Noticing the colorful symbol on the front of Manny’s T-shirt, Muraskin asked him, “Is that a Google shirt?”

No, he replied sheepishly. “World Baseball Classic.”

A spot opened up at one of the desks after the first player finished. Manny took a seat and waited as Sherwin prepared the laptop and Muraskin readied the headgear. He used an alcohol swab to dab behind the player’s ears and fitted the strange translucent swim cap — an EEG headset — over Manny’s short hair. Then he grabbed a syringe and squirted a pale creamy substance into the seams around the nine spots where the sensors were expected to maintain the closest contact with the skull. The cream, the consistency of toothpaste, is a conductive salve for the electrodes.

“You remember this?” he asked. Manny nodded. He quickly typed his user name and password into the system, and the screen went dark, with only a small rectangular box appearing in the center. A moment later Sherwin signaled the program was ready.

“It’ll take about 40 minutes,” Muraskin said. “Do you want any practice?”

“No,” Manny said. “I’m good.”

The simulation began. “And we’re off,” Frank said.

The New Neural

My wife was the one who discovered the small blurb in my Columbia University alumni magazine about the two neuroscientists, Sherwin and Muraskin, trying to work in Major League Baseball. I knew of sports psychology, mindfulness training, even brain gaming as a growing fad among professional franchises. But neuroscience seemed to represent a different level of sobriety. What were they looking for? What had they found?

On the surface, the efforts by Sherwin and Muraskin were intended to help professional baseball teams scout and improve hitters, and since 2014, when they started, all but two M.L.B. franchises have spoken to them about the possibilities of their work with EEG. Several have signed consulting agreements.

“A lot of companies say they’re doing neural,” Muraskin said. “They’re not doing neural.”

Sherwin and Muraskin set themselves apart from the cognitive gaming companies, most of them modeled after Lumosity, which claimed (in some cases, deceptively) to improve mental performance through an app.

“We wanted to be the first company to measure the impact” of a decision to swing, Sherwin said, “and relate that mental side into performance outcomes.”

But, to zoom out a bit, their endeavor seemed to be more like tracing the essential correlates of a skill. This skill could be anything that requires a rapid decision: passing to an open wide receiver, whistling a foul call, responding to gunfire after a report of breaking and entering. Those are outcomes, like the speed of a car as it zips down the highway. Sherwin and Muraskin encouraged me to reconsider what is going on beneath the hood.

Hitting a baseball, to take one of the more straightforward outcomes, has been deemed “the most difficult thing to do in sport.” The most proficient hitters are hardly at all cut from the same cloth. The two front-runners for the Most Valuable Player of the American League in 2017, in fact, were a Venezuelan infielder standing 5 feet 6 inches and weighing 165 pounds (Jose Altuve) and a Californian outfielder standing 6- 7 and weighing 282 pounds (Aaron Judge). We already know what distinguishes them; we can see it. So what relates them? What actually is responsible for their skill?

It would seem to have almost nothing to do with their biceps muscles or fast-twitch fibers or even their vision, which, for most baseball players is largely the same. It would seem to have much more to do with the neural signals that impel our every movement. “It’s like saying people who can speak French very well have a very dexterous tongue,” John Krakauer, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University, told me. “It would be the wrong place to assign the credit.”

How do we move? A few people have looked into this. The Egyptians actually wrote of head injuries and movement disorders. Erasistratus and Herophilus explored the cerebella of fast-moving animals like deer and rabbits. Galen of Pergamon learned about the brain from tending to the wounds of the gladiators. The origin of movement had bewitched some of history’s shrewdest minds: Alcmaeon, Plato, Aristotle, Posidonius, Al-Razi, Descartes, Newton, Franklin. When the brain’s primary seat of voluntary action, the motor cortex, was finally discovered, by a pair of wayward Germans in 1870, the operation had been conducted on a dog sprawled across a dresser at the home of one of the men. The eureka moment howled from a living room in Berlin.

Since then, most motor research has been conducted more quietly. But skilled performance remains a tough nut to crack. It can be surprising when you consider how good artificial intelligence has gotten at replicating and building upon strictly cognitive tasks like, say, strategizing in chess or winning on “Jeopardy!” Yet a 5-year-old child can display a fluidity of dexterity and a range of motion that the most sophisticated computers cannot begin to replicate. Find videos of robots attempting to open a closed door, and you are almost guaranteed a good laugh. This is not a knock on the machinists. It is a reminder to step back and appreciate how we move.

A fastball traveling at 95 miles per hour takes about 400 milliseconds to reach home plate from 60 feet 6 inches away. That does not account for the length of a pitcher’s stride, or the deception pitchers employ with their delivery, or the fact that 37 pitchers in 2016 averaged more than 95 miles per hour with their fastballs. In the amount of time it takes the pitch the reach the plate, the physical limitations imposed just on our bodies — the time it takes for nervous signals to travel from the brain to the correct locations in the body — have already sliced our available response time in half. The resulting time we have to actually gauge the pitch is almost twice as fast as an eye blink. It is slightly slower than the duration of one rotation of a helicopter rotor blade. But in the time it takes to read this word, the ball will have sailed past. It should not seem a wonder, then, that it has been more than 75 years since an M.L.B. player batted .400. It should seem a wonder that our brains enable us to ever hit the ball at all.

A Matter of Milliseconds

What Sherwin and Muraskin were able to show was a baseball version of what is known as rapid perceptual decision-making. This can be reduced, like most things related to the brain, to the patterns of spatially and temporally distinct and interdependent neuron activations. Baseball players, the really good ones, produce or respond to these activations in ways different from other people. The result is they can recognize certain pitches the same way automobile enthusiasts can recognize the make and model of a car as it disappears out of sight, or the way bird-watchers can detect an instantaneous flash of color or flight pattern. It is similar to the way a chess master can quickly visualize and interpret movements on the board.

Statistics such as batting average or on-base percentage have been used to assign value to players for decades. But these, deCervo likes to point out, are post hoc variables. They come only after the player has finished his at-bat. Now deCervo could produce graphs that pinpointed when the batter decided to swing versus when he decided to take, along the time line of the pitch, down to the millisecond. A hitter stands at the ready, sees a 90-m.p.h. slider come toward him, and makes no movement of the bat. DeCervo could still delineate the moment he made that choice to look at the pitch, rather than go for it. It registered as activity on the EEG. It registered as tiny explosions of neural action.

Sherwin and Muraskin did not care so much how the hitters developed their talent. They cared about describing it, in digestible data bites. But they had already begun to tread, perhaps even unwittingly, into a realm once reserved for poets and philosophers.

Another prominent scientist in the field, Daniel Wolpert, has investigated the source of our differences down to the composition of the neural signals that fire. Neurons are like snowflakes; each has individual characteristics. Individually, neurons are almost impossible to classify. But grouped together they produce thoughts, actions, and everything in between. When they fire their action potentials, they can sound like tennis balls pounded against the strings of a racket. “Pop, pop, pop.” They can sound like batting practice.It would seem to have almost nothing to do with their biceps muscles or fast-twitch fibers or even their vision, which, for most baseball players is largely the same.

A Matter of MillisecondsRichard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, later clarified that Mr. Cuomo had proposed the idea during closed-door budget negotiations but that the idea was shot down; no bill was ever advanced.

Mr. Cuomo’s executive order would require the commissioner of the state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision to submit a list of every felon currently on parole, as well as a list of those newly eligible for parole, beginning May 1, said Alphonso David, the governor’s counsel.

The commissioner would continue to submit an updated list each month, with each parolee “given consideration for a conditional pardon that will restore voting rights without undue delay,” according to the order.

Anyone on the list would be eligible for a pardon, Mr. David said, so long as law enforcement had not flagged any special concerns.

The pardon would not expunge a felon’s record nor would it restore other rights stripped from them, such as the right to serve on a jury. Mr. Azzopardi called the executive order a “narrow use of power.”

Mr. Cuomo’s plan would bring New York in line with 18 other states, as well as Washington, D.C., that allow parolees to vote, according to the governor’s office. Fourteen states automatically restore felons’ rights when they are paroled; two never remove them in the first place; and two — Iowa and Virginia — also use executive orders to issue pardons.

Civil-rights advocates hailed Mr. Cuomo’s decision as a long overdue step toward helping former inmates re-enter society.

But Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, cautioned that the state still had “a lot of work to do before we can call ourselves a paragon of democracy,” noting ongoing political gerrymandering and other stalled efforts to enact electoral reform.

Some of the signature accomplishments of Mr. Cuomo’s two terms in office have centered around criminal justice reform. In 2015, he issued an executive order appointing a special prosecutor to investigate police-related civilian deaths, and last year he signed “Raise the Age” legislation that ended the practice of treating 16- and 17-year-old defendants as adults in criminal court. New York had been one of two states that still tried juveniles as adults.

This year, Mr. Cuomo proposed ending cash bail for low-level offenses, a measure that was not included in the final state budget. The governor has also pushed for voting reform, including the introduction of early voting and same-day registration, neither of which was taken up by the Legislature, and neither of which he has the power to enact via executive order.

Republicans assailed the order as a gross overreach of executive authority. Ed Cox, the chairman of the state Republican Party, in a statement, called it an “outrageous power grab” designed to appeal to “radical primary voters.” A visibly angry Senator John J. Flanagan, the Senate majority leader, said the move “circumvents the law.”

“I’m, like, in awe. I’m dumbfounded,” he said, adding, “This is a radical, and I mean radical, departure from the way legislation should be enacted.”

Mr. Cuomo’s primary opponent in his bid for a third term, Cynthia Nixon, has also made criminal justice reform a central plank of her campaign, calling for the legalization of recreational marijuana because of its disproportionate impact on the incarceration of black and Latino New Yorkers.

Ms. Nixon blasted Mr. Cuomo’s executive order as an insufficient, transparent response to her challenge from his left flank.

“For eight years, Cuomo governed like a Republican — handing control of our state to his ultrarich donors and the party of Trump. Now he’s scared of communities all across New York who want to replace him with a real Democrat,” she said in a statement, adding, “Voter suppression in New York should have ended eight years ago.”

But Mr. Cuomo’s aides dismissed the idea that the timing of the announcement — one day after a new poll showed Ms. Nixon closing the gap between herself and Mr. Cuomo, although he retains a commanding lead — had anything to do with Ms. Nixon’s candidacy.

“We’ve been killing ourselves for the past decade to advance the ball forward on criminal justice and voting rights issues,” Mr. David said. “And no one should suggest that because we’re in an election season, we’re doing this because of that.”

Mr. Sharpton, in introducing Mr. Cuomo, also seemed to hint at the scramble between Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Nixon to win over black voters — and seemed to take a swipe at Ms. Nixon for merely “talking about” being progressive, although he did not mention her by name.

“We want you to show your progress by what you do,” he said.

The issuance of 35,000 pardons at once would be remarkable for any governor, but it is particularly so for Mr. Cuomo, who, during his first two years in office, did not issue any pardons; by the end of his fifth year, he had issued eight. To date, he has issued 174 pardons, bolstered by more than 100 conditional pardons he issued in 2016 to people convicted of nonviolent crimes as minors.Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, later clarified that Mr. Cuomo had proposed the idea during closed-door budget negotiations but that the idea was shot down; no bill was ever advanced.

The issuance of 35,000 pardons at once would be remarkable for any governor, but it is particularly so for Mr. Cuomo, who, during his first two years in office, did not issue any pardons; by the end of his fifth year, he had issued eight. To date, he has issued 174 pardons, bolstered by more than 100 conditional pardons he issued in 2016 to people convicted of nonviolent crimes as minors.The trial, which played out over about a month in Wichita, focused on a period before the 2016 presidential election when a paid F.B.I. informant infiltrated a militia group that prosecutors said included the three men. Prosecutors, who built much of their case around secret recordings that the informant made of the men talking, said that they planned to carry out the bombing on Nov. 9 of that year, a day after voters selected a president.

“They wanted to send a message to the people living there that they’re not welcome in Garden City, they’re not welcome in southwest Kansas, they’re not welcome in the United States,” Mr. Mattivi said.

The men, who called themselves “the Crusaders,” were arrested about four weeks before Election Day and charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against rights, which the Justice Department considers a hate crime. Mr. Wright was also charged with lying to the F.B.I. The three men were found guilty on all counts against them.

The trial came amid a national escalation in threats against religious and racial minorities, especially Muslims, according to the F.B.I. and organizations that monitor hate crimes.

“It is now approaching the level of hate violence against the same communities that we saw in the immediate wake of the 9/11 attacks,” said Suman Raghunathan, executive director of SAALT: South Asian Americans Leading Together, a national advocacy organization.

Prosecutors portrayed the Kansas defendants as aspiring domestic terrorists who joined a militia and decided to bomb the Somali apartments after considering other attacks — on elected officials, churches that helped refugees and landlords who rented to immigrants.

Defense lawyers, who criticized the F.B.I.’s investigation throughout the trial as government overreach, suggested that their clients had merely engaged in idle talk inspired partly by the 2016 election. Expletive-filled recordings of the men played before the jury contained repugnant, bigoted language, the defense lawyers said, but not evidence of a federal crime.

“It is not morally right to hold such hate, but it is not legally wrong,” said James Pratt, a lawyer for Mr. Stein, who acknowledged that his client referred to Muslims as “cockroaches.” Mr. Stein referred to himself, the recordings showed, as an “Orkin man,” referencing the pest extermination company.

“We all have the right to hate,” Mr. Pratt added.

A bombing never took place, and no one was physically injured in Garden City, a point defense lawyers emphasized to jurors. They said the men lacked the ability or commitment to carry out such an attack, and that the F.B.I.’s paid informant helped steer the plot and suggested targeting the apartments.

Garden City is a racially diverse place about 200 miles west of Wichita with around 27,000 residents. Many Somalis and other immigrants have moved to the area in recent years to work at a nearby meatpacking plant.

The apartment complex that prosecutors say was targeted is a center of Somali life in Garden City. Many refugee families live in units of the complex; others come to pray in a makeshift mosque inside one unit.

Moussa Elbayoumy, who chairs the board of the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the verdict affirmed his faith in the justice system.

Many Muslims he talked to in Garden City had not followed the trial closely, Mr. Elbayoumy said, but had hoped for convictions.

“The instance was troubling, was concerning. People were afraid,” Mr. Elbayoumy said in a phone interview. “But after that, they put this behind them and moved on with their lives.”Both men’s resignations came as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in Palm Beach, Fla., meeting with President Trump. Mr. Fukuda’s resignation is subject to confirmation by the entire cabinet, including Mr. Abe.

Mr. Fukuda said he had decided to resign because “right now the Finance Ministry is going through a severe time,” apparently a reference to a scandal involving leaks of tampered documents related to a sweetheart land deal that might be connected to Mr. Abe.

“I thought it would be difficult to fulfill my duty,” Mr. Fukuda said. “I apologize to everyone to whom I have caused trouble.”

In the allegations reported by Shincho magazine about Mr. Fukuda, several unidentified journalists said he had repeatedly made sexually suggestive remarks in meetings and at bars.

The magazine also posted a video online with clips taken from an audio recording said to be of Mr. Fukuda telling a woman, “Can I touch your breast?”, “Should we have an affair when the budget is enacted?” and “I will tie your hands.”

At the news conference on Wednesday, when a reporter asked Mr. Fukuda if he recognized his own voice in the recording, he responded, “I hear my voice through my body, so I can’t recognize my true voice when listening with my ears.”

Asked whether he remembered making any of the remarks described in the magazine article, he said, “I do not recall making such remarks,” adding, “I don’t have any memory of having such an awful conversation.”

According to the public broadcaster NHK, Mr. Fukuda would be the first top-ranking official in the Finance Ministry to resign since 1998, when the official who held the same post quit, along with the finance minister and the head of the Bank of Japan, to take responsibility for a corruption scandal.

In Japan, public discussions of sexual harassment and assault are avoided and such resignations are rare. But this year, the president of NH Foods stepped down after a junior executive with whom he had been traveling asked a flight attendant sexually explicit questions in an airport lounge.

And last year, Yuki Kishi, a former executive creative director of Dentsu, Japan’s largest advertising agency, resigned from a company he had founded after a woman accused him of harassing her while they worked at Dentsu.Those changes were all approved in a referendum last year that Mr. Erdogan had campaigned for strenuously, with the obvious intention that he would be the first president to hold the enhanced office.

Mr. Erdogan has since been urging members of his Justice and Development Party to work to build enough support for him to secure the election in the first round.

“Although its seems there are no serious issues arising as the president and the government are working in harmony, the diseases of the old system can confront us at every step,” Mr. Erdogan said in a speech broadcast live on television. “For our country to make decisions about the future more strongly and apply them, passing to the new governmental system becomes urgent.”

Minutes later, the Turkish Parliament approved a request from Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to extend the state of emergency — which has been in force since the failed coup — for another three months, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.

While the coup attempt was violent — nearly 250 people died, including Mr. Erdogan’s election campaign manager and close friend — critics have since accused him of using the extended powers under emergency rule to crack down on political opponents and dissent.

Tens of thousands have been jailed, accused of links to Fethullah Gulen, the Islamist cleric accused of masterminding the coup, or to other designated terrorist organizations. And over 100,000 people have been suspended from public-sector jobs. Mr. Gulen has denied involvement in the coup.

Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said Wednesday that the government had identified three thousand top-level officers belonging to the Gulen movement inside the military, and was preparing to purge them soon with a government decree, the Anadolu news agency reported.

Mr. Erdogan said that events in Syria and Iraq, both countries in which Turkey has deployed troops, had made a transition to the presidential system more urgent. He also said the economic situation demanded certainty.

“With the cross-border operations we maintain in Syria, and also historical events happening in the area centered around Syria and Iraq, it became a must for Turkey to climb over the uncertainty as soon as possible,” the president said.

“In a period where developments about Syria accelerate, and we have to make very important decisions on issues from macroeconomic equilibrium to big investments, it is a must to drop the election issue from the agenda as soon as possible,” he added.

Yet political opponents and commentators have been predicting for months that Mr. Erdogan would call early elections as soon as he could be sure of winning. He is known to closely watch opinion polls and has enjoyed a bounce in his personal rating since ordering military operations against Kurdish militias in the northern Syrian enclave of Afrin in January.

The country also enjoyed over 7 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. Yet there are signs that the economy is faltering. Inflation remains persistently high, which hurts many of Mr. Erdogan’s own supporters.

The snap election was also seen as a move to undercut political opponents.

Mr. Erdogan’s announcement came after discussions with Devlet Bahceli, the leader of Turkey’s main nationalist party, the Nationalist Movement Party, which has entered a formal alliance with Mr. Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., for the elections.

Mr. Bahceli said that he supported early elections for the stability of the country and the economy. But he also seems to be concerned with fending off a rival for the nationalist vote, Meral Aksener, who split from his party and formed her own party, the Good Party, last year, according to Turkish media reports.

The early timing of the election now could prevent Ms. Aksener from running, since her new party may not be considered to have passed the required six months from its first party congress.

Ms. Aksener, a former interior minister, has nevertheless declared her intention to challenge Mr. Erdogan for president and field candidates for Parliament.

Turkey’s largest opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, or C.H.P., was caught flat-footed by the announcement, and has not yet selected a candidate for president. Its leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, ruled out running for the presidency last year.

Engin Altay, the deputy head of C.H.P.’s parliamentary group, told a Turkish television station that a candidate would be chosen within 15 days.

The pro-Kurdish party, the People’s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., has particularly suffered under the state of emergency, with nine members of Parliament in jail, including their popular former leader Selahattin Demirtas and many mayors removed from their posts. The party nevertheless has appointed new leaders and declared itself ready for elections.

Sezai Temelli, the co-chairman of the party, said in a tweet: “June 24 is not early, but a panic election. The government is impotent.”

To win outright in the first round of the election, Mr. Erdogan will need to secure 51 percent of the vote. His personal ratings have been closer to 40 percent in recent opinion polls.

The constitutional changes to create a new presidential system were agreed in a controversial referendum in April last year, which Mr. Erdogan only barely won with a 51 percent yes vote, versus 49 percent who voted no.

Ms. Aksener was a prominent leader of the no campaign and has vowed to assemble similar broad support for the coming elections.

The referendum was criticized as unfair by opposition parties and independent election monitors. Since then, Mr. Erdogan has moved to exercise greater control over the High Election Board and the electoral law, the parties warned.

“The alliance cannot secure 50 percent,” Yalcin Dogan wrote in the online news outlet T24. “So they are changing the structure of the High Election Board and the electoral law in a manner that is against the universal democratic rules. However, the Good Party remains a complete nightmare.”“Fortunately for Josh, he’s better at press conferences than the law,” the governor said in a statement. “Anyone who has set foot in a Missouri courtroom knows these allegations are ridiculous.”

Jim Martin, a lawyer for Mr. Greitens, added that there was “nothing close to wrongdoing” in the matter.

Questions about Mr. Greitens’s use of the nonprofit’s email list have been raised for months, and the governor has denied misusing it for his campaign. In 2016, The Associated Press reported that a member of Mr. Greitens’s campaign was in possession of a list of donors created by a Mission Continues employee.

Susan Ryan, a spokesman for Ms. Gardner, said in a statement that the prosecutor’s office was reviewing the evidence provided by the attorney general. “We can’t discuss any specifics at this time,” she said.

For most of this year, Mr. Greitens, a former Navy SEAL who was elected governor in 2016, has been the target of investigations, charges that he is unfit to serve as governor and calls for his resignation or impeachment, even from members of his own party.

His troubles burst into public view in January when a St. Louis television station broadcast a report that before he became governor, Mr. Greitens had an extramarital affair with a woman, had taken a nude or seminude photograph of her without her permission, and had threatened to make the image public if she told anyone about him.

In February, the governor was indicted by a grand jury in St. Louis on a felony charge of invasion of privacy relating to the photograph. Separately, a House legislative committee in Missouri, mostly made up of Republicans, is investigating Mr. Greitens and could begin a process to impeach him at any time. Mr. Hawley, who has called for Mr. Greitens to resign, said on Tuesday that he had also referred evidence related to the Mission Continues donor list to the committee.

A report released by the House committee last week contained even more explosive allegations against Mr. Greitens. The woman who had a sexual relationship with him in 2015 told the committee that he hit her and she felt coerced into performing oral sex.

Mr. Greitens, a father of two, has insisted that the affair was consensual and that he and his wife, Sheena, have made peace with it.

Mr. Greitens faces trial on the invasion-of-privacy charge in St. Louis on May 14, and has said he views the hearing as an opportunity to clear his name. He could face up to four years in prison if convicted.

Missouri Republicans are concerned that the allegations swirling around the governor could hurt the party this fall in a competitive Senate race in which Mr. Hawley is hoping to unseat Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.

Laura L’Esperance, a spokeswoman for The Mission Continues, said the group was cooperating with the attorney general’s investigation and did not provide or authorize the use of donor information for political or campaign purposes.

On Tuesday, Representative Gail McCann Beatty, the minority floor leader in the House and a Democrat, called the attorney general’s announcement “more disturbing news about what’s going on with the governor.”

“It is time for him to resign,” she said. “Clearly he’s digging in and he’s just not going to step down. At this point the House needs to decide what the next action is that needs to be taken and moving toward getting the governor removed.”Those exercises, which included 48 ships, 76 aircraft and more than 10,000 personnel, were the largest ever carried out by the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the state news media said.

“The task of building a powerful navy has never been as urgent as it is today,” Mr. Xi said Thursday in a speech during the exercises.

The South China Sea exercises were “more about a military parade at sea than anything else,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

“But in the Taiwan Strait it is a warning,” she added. “I think it’s sort of usefully timed but not really planned for this particular moment. The U.S. and Taiwan are seen as heading in a direction that is getting perilously close to Chinese red lines. That is a perception by the Chinese.”

Last month, during an important legislative meeting in Beijing, Mr. Xi issued a stern warning against challenges to its claims over Taiwan or its control of Hong Kong, the former British colony where calls for independence have risen in recent years.

Taiwan held its own military drills on its east coast last week, which President Tsai Ing-wen attended. “We have every confidence and determination to defend our country & #democracy!” she wrote on Twitter. In comments to reporters, she cautioned against interpreting the exercises as an overt response to China’s South China Sea drills the day before.

The series of recent exercises is more a continuation of longstanding practices than a significant escalation of military activity, said Sheryn Lee, a lecturer in security studies at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.

“They have done those kinds of exercises before,” she said. “They’re usually reminding Taiwan of their presence right next door.”

While the United States is Taiwan’s biggest backer, its support is moderated by Chinese demands to limit the island’s international recognition. Under the so-called One China policy, Washington has formal political ties with Beijing, but it maintains unofficial relations with Taipei.

President Trump has been willing to show American support for Taiwan more publicly than his recent predecessors. He broke decades of precedent barring official contact by taking a phone call from President Tsai in December 2016, after he was elected but before he took office.

The recent military exercises come as the Trump administration has challenged China over trade, threatening tariffs that have raised concerns about a damaging trade war. Mr. Trump has previously questioned why the United States should be bound by the One China policy if Beijing will not budge on trade.

Last year, Mr. Trump signed legislation that included encouragement for mutual port calls by American and Taiwanese naval vessels. And last month Mr. Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages high-level official visits between the United States and Taiwan. The bill passed unanimously in the House and Senate despite extensive criticism from China.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong visited Taiwan shortly after the travel act was signed. He told a gathering of business people and Taiwanese officials that the United States wanted “to strengthen our ties with the Taiwan people and to bolster Taiwan’s ability to defend its democracy.”

The American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto United States embassy, is opening a new office complex in Taipei this summer, which could lead to other visits from senior American officials.

Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has long been an advocate for Taiwan, writing last year in The Wall Street Journal that the United States should consider a closer military alliance with it to counter Chinese belligerence.

This month, Chinese officials complained after Taiwan revealed that the United States had approved licenses for the sale of technology that would help Taiwan build its own submarines.

China has also stepped up flights of strategic bombers and fighter jets around Taiwan in recent months. And the Liaoning and other naval ships have sailed through the Taiwan Strait, though they stayed on the Chinese side of the body, which is 81 miles wide at its narrowest point.

On a local news talk show last week, Ms. Tsai rejected an assertion that Taiwan was being helplessly drawn into tensions between the United States and China

“Many people say we are pawns of other people,” she said. “But don’t forget, we are also chess players.”“I think it’s a really important development for this sector,” said Daniel Rutherford, who directs the aviation and marine programs at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a watchdog group. “Until this past week, it didn’t have a climate target.”

But he and others noted that the next few years would be critical. The I.M.O. gave itself until 2023 to develop and implement specific measures to reach the target. These will probably include stricter design and operation standards for ships to increase efficiency, as well as programs to introduce low-carbon fuels or carbon-free propulsion.

“If you don’t make early investments and policies, then it becomes very challenging to meet the I.M.O. goals,” Dr. Rutherford said.

The I.M.O. may also take steps to introduce so-called market-based measures that would set a price on carbon. This would create economic incentives for shippers to adopt new fuels and technologies, which are likely to be costly.

An analysis by researchers at the University College London Energy Institute described the agreement as a signal to the industry and investors “that a clear switch away from fossil fuels is now on the cards.”

The researchers also noted that while the agreement puts shipping on a path to do its part to keep global warming at 2 degrees Celsius (about 4 degrees Fahrenheit), “it’s important to remember Paris targets ‘well below’ 2 C and aims for 1.5 C, so this is no time for complacency.”One need not fear that the next Tanga panty’s design will be crowdsourced. “I’m still the last word on fit,” Ms. Epstein said. “Of course, we make all sizes and we have our in-house focus group, but I’m still involved in the look and feel of everything that comes through the design room. I don’t even trust models to give me exact feedback.”

Ms. Orzeck said, “Gale is supersensitive.”

‘Counting From the Crotch Area’

At the company’s warehouse last month, Rodney Yetter, Hanky Panky’s quality-control manager, explained how his team contributes to a customer return rate that is one-tenth of 1 percent.

“Any type of thing that goes wrong with these is the same type of thing,” Mr. Yetter said. “Human error is easy to find if you know where to look for it. A lace with runoffs, a skipped stitch on a machine. If you’re counting from the crotch area, it’s easy to spot.” He added: “Ninety percent of the returns are because of fit.”

Many of the thongs are “one size fits most” and fit sizes 2 to 14. In a world that requires endless size calibration, this is surely a relief to customers (petite and plus sizes are also available). “We offer an assortment of brands, but Hanky Panky continues to be a category leader,” David Law, the chief merchant at Lord & Taylor, wrote in an email.

Lord & Taylor was the first store to receive an order from Hanky Panky, in 1977, when Ms. Epstein and Ms. Orzeck personally delivered 144 tops and bottoms that Ms. Epstein had spent an entire weekend sewing.

The design that had lured the store’s buyer was a bra-and-bikini set that Ms. Epstein created from Victorian-era handkerchiefs she found in a bridal shop and gave to Ms. Orzeck as a birthday gift. An original version of the set is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s permanent collection.Dyson’s letters are particularly engaging when they describe the occasional flashes of illumination that lead to a scientific insight. Riding on a cross-continental Greyhound bus, past Iowa cornfields, Dyson notes: “On the third day of the journey a remarkable thing happened; going into a sort of semi-stupor as one does after 48 hours of bus riding, I began to think very hard about physics, and particularly about the rival radiation theories of Schwinger and Feynman. Gradually my thoughts grew more coherent, and before I knew where I was, I had solved the problem that had been in the back of my mind all this year, which was to prove the equivalence of the two theories. … This piece of work is neither difficult nor particularly clever, but it is undeniably important.” Dyson was chiefly pleased that once back in Princeton, he would “now encounter Oppenheimer with something to say which will interest him.”

Dyson is fascinated by Oppenheimer: “I have been observing rather carefully his behavior during seminars. If one is saying, for the benefit of the rest of the audience, things that he knows already, he cannot resist hurrying one on to something else; then when one says things that he doesn’t know or immediately agree with, he breaks in before the point is fully explained with acute and sometimes devastating criticisms, to which it is impossible to reply adequately even when he is wrong.” Dyson thought this “impatience” demonstrated by “Oppy” was beyond his control, and in any case, “To me, the interruptions provided many valuable new ideas.”

The letters are also sometimes painfully candid and close to home. In early 1957, Dyson writes his parents from Aspen, Colo., where he has gone on vacation with his mathematician wife, Verena — and he has to report that Verena has “fallen in love and decided to run away” with one of Freeman’s old Cambridge friends. Dyson is clearly devastated that his wife of six years is walking out of what he had considered a “happy” marriage, leaving behind two young children, Esther and George. (Both children forged innovative careers, Esther as a digital-age journalist and angel investor, and George as a historian of science.) Freeman stoically writes his parents: “Please do not offer me your sympathy or your pity. I have been happy in this marriage, and I have no regrets now it is over. … What she has done may be crazy, but it is not irresponsible.”

And then within months, Dyson’s letters begin to mention the name of Imme Jung, the Berlin-born, 20-year-old au pair Verena had hired just before she walked out. “The more I see of Imme,” Dyson writes his parents, “the more impressed I am with her firm and solid character.” Escorting her to dinner at the Oppenheimers one night that spring, Dyson feels like “Higgins taking his Eliza to the ball; after all, Imme is extremely young and has little formal education.” But fortunately, that night Oppenheimer himself was charming: “Oppy especially went out of his way to be friendly to her.”

Dyson was falling in love with his soon-to-be second wife. In an italicized note, he explained that for the next two years as a single dad, while the divorce was taking shape, “I held back from any display of affection for Imme, but it was obvious to all.”

So, these letters are not only about science and politics. There is a love story too! They went on to have four more daughters; Imme became a master runner — the Dysons like to joke that “he has the brains, she has the legs.” If this “autobiography through letters” is not quite memoir, maybe it will nevertheless inspire a film.It was a cold, sunny day last spring when retired U.S. Army Specialist Michael McCoy visited the war memorial in Cumberland, Md., to look for the name of Pfc. Albert M. Nelson.

Mr. McCoy, who grew up in West Baltimore, and Mr. Nelson, who was from West Philadelphia, became close friends in 2006 just before Mr. McCoy’s second of two yearlong deployments to Iraq. Mr. Nelson was a bit of a joker and, at 31, a few years older than the other soldiers. He was a big brother figure, well liked, especially by Mr. McCoy.

“We used to talk about hanging out in Philly when we got home,” he said. “We never got that chance.”“It’s like Forrest Gump won the presidency,” said a Republican congressman in a conversation that Erick Erickson described last week on The Resurgent. The congressman went on, adding profanities, not reproduced here: “But it’s an evil, really stupid Forrest Gump. He can’t help himself. He’s just an idiot who thinks he’s winning when people are bitching about him.”

This comes from a congressman who, Mr. Erickson said, regularly appears on Fox News to defend President Trump. The same congressman used a barnyard epithet to describe how the president treated his fellow Republicans, and concluded, “if we’re going to lose, we may as well impeach the —” well, as we used to say during Watergate, expletive deleted.

They make a wild duet, Gump and Trump, like the set of identical cousins on the old “Patty Duke Show”: “One pair of matching bookends, different as night and day.” But one important difference between the fictional Forrest Gump as played by Tom Hanks in the 1994 film and the president of the United States, as played by Donald Trump in 2018, is that Gump is a fundamentally modest man, painfully aware of his own limitations. “I am not a smart man,” he says. “But I know what love is.”

Mr. Trump says, in contrast, “I’m like, smart.” Does he know what love is? “You know, I don’t want to sound too much like a chauvinist, but when I come home and dinner’s not ready, I’ll go through the roof, O.K.?” he said in the same year “Forrest Gump” was released. So there’s that.“It’s like Forrest Gump won the presidency,” said a Republican congressman in a conversation that Erick Erickson described last week on The Resurgent. The congressman went on, adding profanities, not reproduced here: “But it’s an evil, really stupid Forrest Gump. He can’t help himself.

So there’s that.Those missives included memes: a cartoon bunny that blew kisses before the words “I Love You” exploded like a Roman candle; a snippet of Jason Alexander as George Costanza in “Seinfeld.” There were long, silly strings of colorful, silly icons. From George W. Bush, who had always worked so hard on that Texas swagger?

“He has gone deep into the emojis,” Barbara said. In her contacts he’s identified as Popsicle. In Jenna’s he’s Jefe, which is Spanish for “boss.”

We only think we know the people who wind up, intentionally or not, in the spotlight. We categorize them. Trivialize them. That’s maybe the main plaint and preoccupation of a joint memoir, “Sisters First,” in which Jenna and Barbara each present reminiscences that alternate with the other’s. It will be published on Tuesday.

“What we wanted to write about in the book was the nuance of people that we love,” Barbara said, and they’ve done just that, charting the distance between public image and private reality. The stories that they tell are often self-serving, and they skim over the failures and wages of their father’s presidency. But they do make you question the caricatures that we blithely traffic in, the assumptions that we breezily make and our reluctance to allow for how much the objects of our curiosity can change.

Their father’s late-blooming obsession with painting: Even they didn’t see that one coming. He skipped the trips to art museums that their mother, Laura, took them on when they were kids.

But after his presidency ended in 2009, he got an iPhone, Barbara said, and “discovered this little drawing app and would do little sketches and send them to us.”

Jenna added: “We would say, ‘Hey, Dad, Happy Sunday, what are you up to?’ And he would stick-figure a little airplane.”

“With his little face waving out of it,” Barbara chimed in. That meant that he was flying somewhere.

The book is stippled with insider anecdotes, my favorite of which recounts a meal that Barbara and her mother shared with Silvio Berlusconi in 2006, when he was Italy’s prime minister and Barbara was 24. (She and Jenna are now 35.) Berlusconi complimented her on her blue eyes, told her that she should mate with his son and, for good measure, announced: “If I was younger, I’d have children with you.” Barbara’s loss, obviously, but she has somehow soldiered on.

I told her that when I read that part, I immediately thought of Trump, and of his various comments over the years about the hotness — in Daddy’s eyes — of Ivanka. She didn’t take the bait.

They’re careful, she and Jenna. They have made clear over the years that they’re not perfect political overlaps with the rest of their family, which is the Republican Party’s great modern dynasty. Barbara, for example, appeared in a video endorsing same-sex marriage back in 2011.

Photo

But that’s not the kind of attention they usually court, and during our hours together at Café Altro Paradiso, where Jenna had ricotta dumplings and Barbara swordfish, they repeatedly registered their disgust with the divisiveness of our national conversation. They don’t want to add to the ugliness, which pains Jenna all the more, she said, because she has two daughters, Mila, 4, and Poppy, 2.

“This moment, as a mother, feels a little frightening, because I’m nervous to have the TV on to hear some of the rhetoric that is coming from the highest position,” Jenna said, conspicuously not uttering the syllable “Trump” itself. “The way I speak about elections and the way I speak about everything has changed, because I’m now a role model to two little humans who I want to teach about love and empathy and compassion.”

She and Barbara, who is single, woke up together in Jenna’s bed on the morning after election night, because Jenna’s husband, Henry Hager, was away, and Barbara had come over to watch the returns, which were still being counted into the wee hours. Jenna wouldn’t say if those results disappointed her, but she and Barbara both expressed a fierce wish to see a female president soon.

“One hundred percent,” Jenna said, and again mentioned her girls. “Mila, the other day in the car, goes, ‘Mommy, Poppy rules the world,’ about her baby sister. And I go: ‘Well, Poppy could rule the world. Maybe one day she could be president.’ And Mila goes, ‘But, Mom, presidents are men.’ She said that.”

From mid-1999 to late-2001 I covered their father’s campaign and the start of his presidency, and I remember seeing them on the fringes of events. I also remember the media’s sometimes cheap fascination with them when they went off to college — Jenna to the University of Texas, Barbara to Yale — and were repeatedly caught consuming alcohol before they were legally old enough to.

“Jenna and Tonic” was a headline in The New York Post. People magazine went with “Double Trouble,” while Newsweek opted for “Busted Again in Margaritaville.” They were embarrassed, yes, but also frustrated by what they insist were exaggerations in many accounts.

Back then I was never formally introduced to either of them. But perhaps five years ago, Barbara visited me at The Times to discuss the Global Health Corps, a public-health analogue to the Peace Corps and Teach for America that sends more than 100 recent college graduates annually into the most impoverished areas of the world. She founded it, raised money for it, is its chief executive and spends plenty of time in those places herself.

Partly because of her focus on health but largely to stir up trouble, I asked her and Jenna, whom I was meeting for the first time, about Trump’s move to make it easier for employers to deny coverage of birth control. He’d announced that just hours before our lunch.

“It does feel like we’re going backwards in some ways,” Jenna said, “and that’s probably as much as I can say.”

Is she pro-choice?

“I can’t say,” she answered. “I’d be in trouble at work.”

Barbara?

“I am very for women having everything they need to live healthy, dignified lives,” she told me.

“Is that a yes?” I asked.

“I think women should be able to make the right decision that would allow them to live — truly allow them to live,” she said.

Jenna shook her head: “He might have wanted a yes or no.” Indeed he might have.

Their father opposed abortion rights but their mother stayed mum, vaguely identifying herself as pro-choice only after the couple left the White House. That approximated the trajectory of her mother-in-law, the former first lady Barbara Bush, who pops up frequently in “Sisters First” and, like the rest of the clan, isn’t exactly who you expect.

Regal? Entitled? Not according to the account of the twins’ visit to the White House shortly after the first President Bush’s election, when they were 7. They discovered the bowling lane in the basement and, using the phone there, asked a staffer to bring them peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

“We were like Eloise in our Plaza!” Jenna writes. “When the door opened, it was not our sandwiches, but our Ganny, who appeared and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not in a hotel, but temporary guests in a historic home, and we were never to do that again.”

Laura Bush is “quiet and bookish,” Barbara writes, but then again not: “Beneath her flats and cardigans, my mom is in fact our closet hippie and Rastafarian.” She dragged Barbara, then a teenager, to a reggae concert in Austin, Tex.

Barbara also writes that while her father can be “loud and unthoughtful,” he “outreads us all.” After Barbara went through her first devastating romantic breakup a few years ago, he called or texted her daily, “just to check in, just to share the burden with me.”

The twins portray him as surprisingly self-effacing.

During his presidency, they spotted an anti-Bush bumper sticker with a withering put-down, and they not only told him about it but turned it into a running family joke. “Now,” Barbara writes, “this line comes up regularly when we want to rib our former-leader-of-the-free-world father: ‘Well, somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot.’ ”

After Jenna, covering the Golden Globes for NBC, conflated two movies about African-Americans by referring to “Hidden Fences,” he quickly texted her to remind her that where verbal pratfalls were concerned, he’d been there, done that and survived. She would, too.

Jenna and Barbara told me that for as long as they can remember, he has brought their mother coffee in bed every morning, including when he was in the White House, because he’s always up first. He brings them coffee in bed when they visit.

They seemed to me a long, long way from Margaritaville. They’re not the Manhattan party fixtures they could easily be. They show considerable restraint. They also show generosity.

Back in January, as Malia and Sasha Obama prepared to move out of the White House, Jenna and Barbara wrote them a letter that acknowledged the challenges that they’d already faced and that they would continue to confront, including “harsh criticism of your parents by people who had never even met them.”

“Your precious parents,” the Bush twins wrote, “were reduced to headlines.”

So were their parents. Their grandparents. Their low-energy uncle, Jeb. It goes with the territory. But it’s also part of what makes that ground so forbidding, and scares many good people away.The lack of a “liberal Tea Party” reflects a fundamental and longstanding asymmetry between Republicans and Democrats. The Republican Party is the agent of an ideological movement; most Republican politicians, activists and voters view their party as existing to advance the conservative cause.

Because their goals of reducing the scope of government and reversing cultural change are difficult to achieve in practice, Republican officeholders are vulnerable to accusations of failing to uphold principles. They risk becoming targets of interest groups, media outlets and rival politicians who see their role as enforcing symbolic commitment to conservative orthodoxy.

The Democratic Party, by contrast, is organized as a coalition of social groups. Democratic voters tend to view politics as an arena of intergroup competition rather than a battlefield for opposing philosophies, and the party is dominated by an array of discrete interests that choose candidates on the basis of demographic representation and capacity to deliver policy. Tensions within the party coalition have eased over time — to the benefit of Democratic leaders, who are now better able to satisfy the various demands of their members and avoid facing a mutiny from within.

Democratic voters detest Mr. Trump just as much as Republicans disliked Barack Obama, but they have different ways of expressing their opposition. The Tea Party movement reflected a popular dissatisfaction with cultural change, of which Mr. Obama’s election was a powerful symbol. Politicians, media personalities and interest group leaders on the right encouraged these sentiments but channeled them into opposition to Democratic economic priorities such as the Affordable Care Act by activating broader symbolic conservative predispositions.

Republican critics accused Mr. Obama of imposing socialism and favoring runaway government; Democrats attack Mr. Trump for his mistreatment of vulnerable social groups. The most visible manifestations of Democratic mobilization since Mr. Trump’s election have been a series of protests, each focused on one issue and led by a specific element of the group coalition. Large-scale national events have highlighted the concerns of feminists, racial minorities, young people, environmentalists and unionized public employees. Democrats promote a different cause nearly every week, with each rally promoted as an opportunity to mobilize social groups for elections and a practical policy agenda.But an anti-immigration outfit called Save Jobs USA sued the Obama administration, claiming that work authorization for H-1B spouses meant that the United States would end up “importing” two foreign workers for every one. Instead of defending the regulation in court, the Trump administration has decided, come June, to scrap it to advance its “Buy American, Hire American” agenda. Although there is nothing official yet, once the regulatory process is completed, the government may stop handing out new authorizations or renewing existing ones when they expire.

Restrictionists assume a zero-sum math for workers: A job gain for a foreigner is a job loss for an American. By that logic every college graduate who enters the job market would be cause for mourning. But that’s backward, given that skilled individuals create, not take away, jobs, and no economy succeeds by shackling qualified people.

These women are qualified because educated people tend to marry other educated people. The majority of H-4 women have college degrees, according to a 2014 survey by the blogger Rashi Bhatnagar, herself an H-4 visa holder. They also happen to be between the ages of 26 and 35 — peak productive years. It would be far better for the economy to accommodate their ambitions and turn them into productive, taxpaying individuals.

Not letting them do so is a personal tragedy for them. But it also turns the restrictionist worry that immigrants today prefer to live transnational lives rather than assimilate into a self-fulfilling prophecy. A job is not just income. It is also an assimilation program because it offers an entry into a new culture and a chance to form new friendships.

Because getting a green card took only a few years when I came, I, like many other spouses in my situation, used that time to obtain a graduate degree and build skills in preparation for entering the job market. However, what would be the point of investing that kind of time and effort in an advanced degree if there is so little certainty that it would actually offer a return one day? Many H-4 wives I know end up staying at home, Skyping with friends and family back home to escape the boredom and isolation of being confined to a “gilded cage” — their description of their life in America.

I remember feeling an exhilarating world of opportunities open up before me when I got my green card. It is sad — and senseless — that President Trump is so determined to prevent others like me from experiencing the full promise of America and participating fully in American life.Next, Gilda sped me to a sitting room/kitchen, where there were a bunch of girls our age in jeans and T-shirts — nice neighbors, I assumed, who came to visit and laze around. There was an open back door to the swimming pool, surrounded by stereo speakers loudly playing something like “Some Enchanted Evening.” Gilda pulled on a swimsuit and introduced her two old girlfriends from Detroit, with whom she’d performed fake water ballet for years. Now, with her being ill, they visited Stamford, and as it was fake water ballet season again, they executed Balanchine-like moves, pointing toes and breast-stroking — while walking on the pool floor — to the music blaring from the speakers for all Stamford to enjoy.

Gilda changed, we walked her dog, and she told me about a recent party in Los Angeles at Laraine Newman’s (Gilda was there, I think, to see some doctor). Her party plan: stay five minutes. But Billy (Murray) and Danny (Aykroyd) carried her up and down the stairs by her arms and legs, and from room to room, so she couldn’t leave.

It got dark. Next topic: my love life (re: marriage). I said, it’s shocking, but living together, which should be the Big Segue, was making it harder! Marriage was both of our goals — Gilda (when single) even asked Jane Curtin (married) if she and her husband, Patrick, would let Gilda drop by to watch them be married one evening, just to see what it was like.

Gilda grabbed my car keys and jumped in my driver’s seat so that I couldn’t leave. In the house, the neighbors turned an upholstered bench into a big bed. It got darker.

“Remember when you and I took tap-dancing lessons?” Gilda asked. I remembered this and more: like the time some suave guy invited her to his house in Brazil for Christmas. She flew 14 hours, went in, hugs, kisses, then he pointed to a girl and said, “Gilda, I’d like you to meet my fiancée, Joan.” Gilda said: “Hello. May I use your phone?” then called the airline, jumped back in his limo and flew 14 hours home.

I remembered she truly wanted to weigh zero, and invented her famous drink, the Vodka Tab. I remembered she said all the women at her family’s weddings had zero to one breast — only she had two.

In the house, a sheet fluttered up onto the bed, and it suddenly struck me: These girls weren’t neighbors. They were nurses, there to give Gilda some treatment, or do something, at home; she hated hospitals and could afford this. Her dog pulled her from my driver’s seat. We hugged and promised we’d talk soon. Sadly, we didn’t.I met her in 1981, when I went to work for her husband as speechwriter. I was a bit in awe of her — who wasn’t? — and, I confess, a bit scared. A few weeks in, I wrote a speech that went over well, in no small part due to President George H.W. Bush’s solid delivery. After the event as we reboarded Air Force Two, Barbara Bush spotted me and said, “That’s the best speech he’s ever given.” I said, “Well, we all worked hard on that speech.” Her face went stony as she brushed past my seat. She said, “Oh, don’t be such a Pollyanna.”

Ouch. Boy, did that leave a welt. It took a while to heal, but I realized she was absolutely right, and thus learned two lessons: 1) Don’t be a Pollyanna, and 2) Mrs. Bush had a bull-detector like no one. She gave it to you with the bark off. But when you earned her affection, which I eventually did, it meant all the more. You knew it was real.

There was no falsity, no pretense, no guile, no spin, no art to Barbara Bush, who died on Tuesday. She was What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get avant la lettre. (That is, before the concept of WYSIWYG had a name.) Americans are always clamoring about the virtues of “transparency.” Barbara Bush was as transparent as distilled water. Who but she would have said of her own (adored) son, as he weighed a campaign for the presidency, “If we can’t find more than two or three families to run for high office, that’s silly. There are a lot of great families. There are other people out there that are very qualified. We’ve had enough Bushes!” Thanks, Mom!

If she was Mrs. No-Nonsense, she also had a playful, even girlish, side to her. On one occasion, I was alone in a freight elevator with Mr. and Mrs. Bush and their Secret Service detail when it got stuck between floors. Stuck elevators are viewed grimly by the Secret Service. The atmosphere inside quickly elevated (as it were) to Condition Red, with hands reaching for the holstered Glock 9’s, orders barked into wrist-mics and all the rest. The Bushes were blithe. I was standing behind them. Mr. Bush’s fingers reached for Mrs. Bush’s derrière and gave it a pinch. She turned to him and grinned like an 18-year-old. “Hi-ya, fellah,” she said. So I can claim to have witnessed a primal scene between Mom and Dad Bush.What we are only beginning to understand is why women are more susceptible. What factors differentiate women from men, specifically as we reach middle age?

The first and most obvious thing is fertility. Women are diverse, but we all experience the decline in fertility and the beginning of menopause.

It turns out that menopause affects far more than our childbearing potential. Symptoms like night sweats, hot flashes and depression originate not in the ovaries but largely in the brain. These symptoms are all caused by an ebb in estrogen. The latest research, including my own work, indicates that estrogen serves to protect the female brain from aging. It stimulates neural activity and may help prevent the build up of plaques that are connected to the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. When estrogen levels decline, the female brain becomes much more vulnerable.

To determine this, my colleagues and I used a brain imaging technique called PET on a group of healthy middle-aged women. This allowed us to measure neural activity and the presence of Alzheimer’s plaques. The tests revealed that the women who were postmenopausal had less brain activity and more Alzheimer’s plaques than premenopausal women. More surprising, this was also the case for perimenopausal women — those who were just starting to experience symptoms of menopause. And both groups’ brains showed even more drastic differences when compared with those of healthy men of the same age.

The good news is that as women mature into their 40s and 50s, there seems to be a window of opportunity when it is possible to detect early signs of higher Alzheimer’s risk — by doing a brain-imaging test, as we did — and to take action to reduce that risk.The Israeli educational system perpetuates the Nakba by refusing to teach about Palestinian society before 1948. Children in public schools throughout the country, Arab and Jewish, learn about European Zionists like Theodore Herzl, who died well before the establishment of Israel, but nothing about Palestinians before 1948. One would think there was not a Palestinian artist, poet or author before Israel’s founding.

The residents of the small village of Umm al-Hiran, whose 1,000 residents are Palestinian citizens of Israel, tasted the continuing Nakba bitterly last week. They have been battling with the Israeli government for years to receive recognition for their village, which would allow it to finally be connected to the water and electrical grids, and to benefit from public infrastructure like paved roads. But the state dug in its heels in and refused, bulldozing the village over and over.

Finally, desperate to end the uncertainty and pain of living and raising families so precariously, the village residents signed an agreement with the government to move to a nearby town. Umm al-Hiran will be demolished, and a new town called Hiran will be built in its place. According to the planned town’s bylaws, it will be home to religious Jews only; these racist requirements are legal under current Israeli law.

Palestinians living in the occupied territories feel the continuing Nakba constantly, at each checkpoint that makes travel unbearable and keeps them contained, at each funeral for an unarmed protester killed by Israeli snipers and each time a settlement is built on stolen land with the blessing of the Israeli government. And if the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu follows through on its desires to annex the West Bank without providing full equal rights to its Palestinian residents, it won’t be a new Nakba. It will be the continuation of one that has never fully ended.

I don’t believe that my grandparents could have imagined 70 years ago that I would become a member of Knesset, representing Palestinian citizens of Israel, a minority voice in the parliament of the country we did not ask for but that came to us on the land we have always called home. I can’t know what place my children and grandchildren will have in their society in the future. But I am sure that to be able to create the kind of future I want for them — one in which they can live with equality and in peace — Israelis will have to do more than recognize the Nakba. They will have to end it.How does the most debased, dishonest president in American history attack people who have spent their lives upholding the rule of law?“Women are marrying later, they’re a little more certain of themselves,” said Amanda Miller, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Indianapolis. “Many marry today not as a blushing bride, but they think of themselves as women, so they have their own set of expectations as opposed to carrying out the expectations of others. At this moment, women’s voices are more valued.”

Ms. Huff said her husband, Collin Vaughn, 44, “was really happy” with her natural look. “He was glad I didn’t look like a prom queen. I felt beautiful. I felt fresh and like myself.”

Rather than hiring a makeup artist, she flew Melanie Simon, an aesthetician based in Los Angeles, to Italy for the wedding. Ms. Simon brought 70 skin care products and a bag of “facial tools.” Foundation was swapped for masks and serums rich in oxygen, collagen, placenta, antioxidants and anti-aging properties. Facials were done daily before the rehearsal dinner and wedding.

“Laurie really stood to her guns, even when people tried to change her mind,” said Ms. Simon, adding that she is currently working with another barefaced bride. “Years ago people would have said, ‘No way in hell. I need a makeup artist, I must have a makeup artist.’ This generation cares about their skin, they’re going toward cleaner products and a less-is-more thinking. They’ve been brought up differently.”

Others are citing skin care trends and terminology from Korean beauty (or K-Beauty) products — like Glass Skin, which focuses on moisturizing and highlighting, and Cloudless Skin, which refers to the clearness and brightness of one’s skin — as no makeup incentives.

“Instagram and social media are encouraging people to make their skin more perfect,” said David Ruff, a beauty and style Instagram influencer. “Women who don’t wear makeup are doing it for themselves. The message they’re sending is that they don’t need to cover their face in makeup to feel a sense of beauty, especially if they’re confident with how their skin looks.”

Better skin might be one reason for the shift, another is a desire for authenticity.

“Society expects women to plan this event, which can be overwhelming,” said Shauna Stribula, 37, who works for the office of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. She married Evan Losow, 34, at the Peristyle in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, in September before 200 guests.

On her wedding day, she wore just a hint of makeup, and only after caving in to the encouragement and pleading of her friend Morgan Soloski, 36, of Los Angeles, who flew in for the event.

“Women shouldn’t have to wear makeup to be regarded as fully formed people,” Ms. Soloski agreed, “but for these milestone events I still think there’s something nice about being dressed up.”

Before the wedding Ms. Soloski presented Ms. Stribula with a makeup bag and Tarte makeup palette. “Shauna wanted to give it back to me,” Ms. Soloski said. She said, ‘I’m not going to use is.’”

Ms. Stribula conceded. Yet each time Ms. Soloski applied a stroke of blush or a puff of shadow, Ms. Stribula removed it. “She fought me at every pass — I applied the lightest amount of something and she would take it off,” she said. “She looked beautiful without anything. A fresh, natural bride. That’s who she is.”

In the end, the bride wore just a hint of lip gloss, eyeliner and powder.

“Weddings are performative,” Ms. Stribula said. “You’re up there to be viewed and judged. Not wearing makeup was a natural representation and a natural extension of me. I’m publicly proclaiming my love, not my beauty.”

The no-makeup (or nearly no-makeup) movement caught on with one of Ms. Stribula’s wedding guests as well.

Debbie Pressman, 34, a publicist at a music marketing and management agency, had very little makeup on her face when she married Jonathan Cobb, 32, on March 16 at the Meatball Shop in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood.

“Watching Shauna was inspiring,” Ms. Pressman said. “I used to be a big makeup person, but I was hiding behind the layers. Wearing it at my wedding seemed fake, especially with the filters and all this prep work, people know it’s not you.”

Ms. Pressman had her nails done (for pampering) and a stylist do her hair (for taming sake). She wore lip gloss, mascara and BB cream. “I don’t want my wedding to feel like a job,” she said. “I work hard all day. My fiancé has seen me at my worst and still thinks I’m beautiful.”

Regardless of the reasons for their desired appearance, the results for these women were the same: beautiful, natural and theirs.

“Every person I talked to told me how beautiful I looked,” Ms. Stribula said. “I find it fascinating that people kept saying it was a brave statement to make at my wedding. It was the version I wanted to present to the world, which was one with very limited makeup.”Next, churches can also enjoy the benefits of dark money. Unlike other groups, churches are required to disclose essentially nothing about who or what supplies them with their funds. And Focus on the Family, like a number of other groups on the religious right, may worry that its opposition to same-sex relationships will land it on the wrong side of anti-discrimination law. After all, the “moral behavior standards” in their employee guidelines prohibit “homosexual acts.”

The Family Research Council, a close partner that for a time merged with Focus on the Family, is registered as a nonreligious nonprofit, rather than as a church. But one of the council’s principal aims is to convert America’s churches, or at least conservative ones, into partisan political cells. It seeks to place what it calls “culture impact teams” in churches to “advance Kingdom values in the public arena.”

The way that Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council see it, the Bible offers specific information about how people ought to vote. Scripture, they say, opposes public assistance on principle (“God has charged believers to help the poor and widows and orphans,” the council’s culture impact team manual explains). Apparently, the Bible is also against gun control and supports privatization of schools through vouchers. It tells us that same-sex relationships are an abomination.

It does not want women to have access to comprehensive reproductive care. Environmentalism, according to the source the manual recommends to church groups, is a “litany of the Green Dragon” and “one of the greatest threats to society and the church today.” Other sources the manual recommends promote the notion that the earth is 6,000 years old.

There is no mystery about which political party the Bible supports, at least as these groups see it. In the run-up to the 2016 election, James Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family and its former leader, praised Donald Trump and explained that the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency “scares me to death.” Their claim that they are nonpartisan is laughable.The Cheese

The rule for cooking with wine also applies to cheese: Don’t cook with anything you wouldn’t want to drink or eat on its own. On average, you’ll need a pound and a half to two pounds of cheese per pound of pasta. But the type of cheese can vary depending on the style of macaroni and cheese you are making and your preferred flavors and textures.

Cheddar reigns here, somehow always behaving exactly as it should. It melts wonderfully, never breaking or becoming greasy, with just the right amount of salt and tang. Sharp, extra sharp and sharp white are best.

To bolster flavor, adding a touch of something a bit more assertive like fontina or Gruyère is excellent, but be sure that at least half of the cheese used is Cheddar. Fontina and Gruyère are richer and fattier and could cause a sauce to break if used on their own. Avoid ultra mild cheeses like Monterey Jack or Colby: While they are fine for melting, they lack the salt or tang to make them worth your while.

A bit of Parmesan or pecorino (up to an additional 1/4 cup grated) can always be added for deeper flavor and saltiness, but too much and the sauce could become grainy.

Whatever cheese you use, it’s always best to grate from a block rather than buying pre-grated cheese (which can contain additives to prevent it from clumping in the bag).

Now, in a perfect world, any cheese worth eating would be a good candidate for your macaroni and cheese, but that’s not the world we live in. There are many factors involved, including fat, salt, protein and water content, that make one cheese more suitable than another. For example, resist the urge to melt your favorite creamy Camembert (too fatty) or salty Gouda (too grainy) into this sauce. They’re much better as a sprinkle here and there.

Beware of too much experimentation, though. If, in adding cheeses, you find your sauce appears broken, you can occasionally remedy it by whisking in more milk (if too thick) or Cheddar (if too runny) while it’s still warm. But unlike, say, mayonnaise, once dairy breaks, it’s often broken for good. It doesn’t mean your sauce is inedible; you may just need to lower your expectations. It’ll still be delicious, but not as creamy.“They get to see themselves on videotape and it can be very eye-opening how their child reacts to them when they do different things,” said Adriana Weisleder, one of the authors of the study, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Northwestern University. “We try to highlight the positive things in that interaction — maybe they feel a little silly, and then we show them on the tape how much their kid loves it when they do these things, how fun it is — it can be very motivating.”

“Positive parenting activities make the difference for children,” said Dr. Benard Dreyer, a professor of pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine and past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, who was the senior author on the study. He noted that the critical period for child development starts at birth, which is also a time when there are many pediatric visits. “This is a great time for us to reach parents and help them improve their parenting skills, which is what they want to do.”

The Video Interaction Project started as an infant-toddler program, working with low-income urban families in New York during clinic visits from birth to 3 years of age. Previously published data from a randomized controlled trial funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development showed that the 3-year-olds who had received the intervention had improved behavior — that is, they were significantly less likely to be aggressive or hyperactive than the 3-year-olds in the control group.

This new study looked at those children a year and a half later — much closer to school entry — and found that the effects on behavior persisted. The children whose families had participated in the intervention when they were younger were still less likely to manifest those behavior problems — aggression, hyperactivity, difficulty with attention — that can so often make it hard for children to do well and learn and prosper when they get to school.

Some children were enrolled in a second stage of the project, and the books and toys and videotaping continued as they visited the clinic from age 3 to 5; they showed additional “dose-response” effects; more exposure to the “positive parenting” promotion meant stronger positive impacts on the children’s behavior.

“The reduction in hyperactivity is a reduction in meeting clinical levels of hyperactivity,” Dr. Mendelsohn said. “We may be helping some children so they don’t need to have certain kinds of evaluations.” Children who grow up in poverty are at much higher risk of behavior problems in school, so reducing the risk of those attention and behavior problems is one important strategy for reducing educational disparities — as is improving children’s language skills, another source of school problems for poor children.

But all parents should appreciate the ways that reading and playing can shape cognitive as well as social and emotional development, and the power of parental attention to help children flourish. Dr. Weisleder said that in reading and playing, children can encounter situations a little more challenging than what they usually come across in everyday life, and adults can help them think about how to manage those situations.

“Maybe engaging in more reading and play both directly reduces kids’ behavior problems because they’re happier and also makes parents enjoy their child more and view that relationship more positively,” she said.

Reading aloud and playing imaginative games may offer special social and emotional opportunities, Dr. Mendelsohn said. “We think when parents read with their children more, when they play with their children more, the children have an opportunity to think about characters, to think about the feelings of those characters,” he said. “They learn to use words to describe feelings that are otherwise difficult and this enables them to better control their behavior when they have challenging feelings like anger or sadness.”

“The key take-home message to me is that when parents read and play with their children when their children are very young — we’re talking about birth to 3 year olds — it has really large impacts on their children’s behavior,” Dr. Mendelsohn said. And this is not just about families at risk. “All families need to know when they read, when they play with their children, they’re helping them learn to control their own behavior,” he said, so that they will come to school able to manage the business of paying attention and learning.Like a golden wedding anniversary, the 50th anniversary of a dance company is an achievement that deserves a celebration — more so, since far fewer dance companies than marriages last that long. In both cases, though, you don’t go to the party expecting surprises.

The 50th anniversary season of the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company, which opened at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, includes one premiere, “Something About Night.” Like all the works by Mr. Lubovitch that I have seen, it is a piece of fine craftsmanship. Set to beautiful music — several Schubert songs for male chorus — it matches that music’s mood and attentively flows along its contours, rising and falling like breath. In group sections, a duet and a solo, it shows off the technical finesse of the company’s excellent dancers. And also like every work by Mr. Lubovitch that I have seen, it made little impression on me.

There’s something about Mr. Lubovitch’s choreography that makes it difficult to say what’s wrong. The style is attractive; a 1960s compromise between ballet and modern dance, it has a middle-of-the-road mellifluousness, full-bodied yet careful. The structures are solid, even classical in their adherence to the rules of some old choreographic handbook. It isn’t a question of what’s there, but what isn’t: the mysterious quality that makes you feel that the top of your head has been taken off or any of the other metaphors that try to pinpoint the difference between verse and poetry, between admirable craft and inescapable art.

For decades, critics like me have been noting this absence. And for decades, other critics and audience members have reacted differently, as attested by the many lifetime achievement awards that Mr. Lubovitch has been racking up lately. Mr. Lubovitch has defended himself (humbly, not aggressively) as a contrarian conservative, a romantic defender of old-fashioned beauty unafraid of sentimentality. But that defense implies that there’s too much of something, when the hard truth is that there’s not enough.

The opening night program didn’t reach very far back into Mr. Lubovitch’s past. (Alternate programs include “A Brahms Symphony,” from 1985, and scenes from the three-act “Othello” he made for American Ballet Theater in 1997.) “The Legend of Ten,” a 2010 work that responds to Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F Minor with handsome school-of-fish patterns and muted folk gestures, was danced by members of the Martha Graham Dance Company. They looked like softened Graham dancers perfectly comfortable dancing something less demanding than Graham.

Mr. Lubovitch’s choreography always looks like it would feel good to dance. You can doze or drown in such warm baths. I’m almost grateful for the elements of “Men’s Stories: A Concerto in Ruin,” a long 2000 work for nine men, that I find off-putting: the ostentatiously chopped and sampled score by Scott Marshall, the attempts at eccentricity. Here, the romanticism, the dreamy nostalgia for boyhood, has something a little rougher to rub against.Times have changed for travelers who use wheelchairs, are visually or hearing-impaired or have another disability, says Jayne Bliss, a travel adviser with Tzell, who has more than 30 years of experience in planning trips for those with special needs.

“No place is off limits, and hotels, museums and cultural institutions offer more accessibility than ever before,” Ms. Bliss said. Here are some of her tips to travel smoothly with a disability:

Ask Your Airline for Help

Asking your airline for assistance, either at the time of booking or a few days before your trip, will make your time at the airport much easier. Many airlines will designate an employee to meet you curbside when you arrive or at check-in with a wheelchair (if you need one) and guide you through security. You can also request assistance when you land at your destination.

There is usually no charge for this service, but policies vary by airline and may depend on available staff and your disability, so be sure to clarify with your carrier before you fly. Also, many carriers allow guide dogs on board free of charge for passengers who are visually-impaired (as long as you make a reservation for your guide dog at least 48 hours in advance of your flight).

Plan With Your Hotel in Advance

Most hotels in all price ranges welcome travelers with disabilities, according to Ms. Bliss. However, it’s key to give them a heads up about what your needs are if there’s anything specific. If you’re in a wheelchair, for example, get measurements for the front, guest and bathroom doors in advance of your stay. Most hotel concierges will be happy to provide you this information, any many list it online. Ms. Bliss said that some her clients’ wheelchairs are too large for many properties, even if they claim to have accessible rooms and facilities. Also, if you’re visually impaired and find buffet breakfasts or continental breakfast bars challenging, ask your hotel’s concierge to fill your in-room fridge with breakfast items, or deliver them to your room instead.Though Spanish missionaries grew grapevines in Arizona in the 16th-century colonial era here, the state’s contemporary production is considerably younger.

“Around 1999, I started looking at the terrain in Jerome and the surrounding foothills and realized it looked a lot like places in Spain and Italy,” said Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer for the rock band Tool who released his first Caduceus wines, made in Jerome, in 2004.

He later joined with Mr. Glomski in 2007 in founding Arizona Stronghold Vineyards, now the largest winery in the state. (Mr. Keenan is no longer a partner.)

Skeptics question how a state like Arizona, more associated with saguaros than Sangiovese, can produce wine, but vintners here say rain and frost are their greatest foes.

“In Arizona, you’ve got to go up to find vineyards,” said Corey Turnbull, the winemaker at Burning Tree Cellars, located in a former auto dealership in Cottonwood. “People think it’s cactus and tumbleweed but Arizona is very diverse, with pine forests and snowcapped mountains. You’ll find vineyards between 3,200 to 5,200 feet.”The economic lifeline provided by subsidized oil from Venezuela is drying up, and Cuba does not have much of an export base. Investment laws from 2014 intended to open up the economy to foreign investment are falling short of their goals. Even the much-promoted (though exaggerated) successes of the revolution in health care and education have been eroded by shortages and lack of state investment.

The major economic challenge will be unifying Cuba’s dual currency system, which uses a domestic peso and a separate international peso for trading with other countries. (The international peso trades artificially at a rate of one-to-one with the United States dollar, and the domestic peso trades at a rate generously assumed to be 24 local pesos to the international peso.) Unifying the currencies will cause upheaval in the economy, increasing the prices of imported goods and ending the double-booking system that many businesses use to keep themselves artificially solvent, leading to inflation and unemployment. Modernizing and advancing the Cuban economy requires addressing this wrenching change.

This is where the United States can come in. While it is not in America’s interest to promote investment to prop up an anachronistic, repressive regime, it is also not in its interest to stand by while a neighbor’s fragile economy crumbles under the weight of its failed policies. In the worst of cases, an economic implosion would produce social unrest and waves of migrants to American shores.

Multilateral banks like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, at Washington’s urging, could be given special allowances to offer economic assistance to the next Cuban government while providing international cover for American-led efforts. Any aid should come with a strong message from Washington and the banks that the Cuban government must refrain from repression in response to protests.

Doing this would require restoring the American Embassy personnel to its pre-Trump levels so that officials can have broader contacts with the government and with the population — as was negotiated under the Obama administration.

Even if incrementally, generational change is coming to Cuba. And whether or not Mr. Díaz-Canel wants it, the country faces difficult economic decisions.

Rather than not engaging, the United States should play a cautious, principled role in helping Cuba, and by doing so, shape its future toward more economic and political openness.“Well,” Mrs. Bush replied, “the second act was a bit racy for us.”

Mrs. Bush died at her home in Houston on Tuesday at the age of 92. The patrons of Tanglewood Park remember Mrs. Bush in much the same way Houston itself remembers her — as a kind of straight-talking grandmother to the city, an approachable first lady out for a stroll in the sunshine, so genuinely earthbound that she herself picked up after her dogs at the park. Passers-by offered their assistance at those inelegant moments, but she politely turned them away. If there is an art to being both neighborly and presidential, to being classy even when things got a little messy, Mrs. Bush embodied it.

Houston has long revered larger-than-life oil wildcatters, Astrodome-size building hucksters and Right-Stuff space heroes. Its two most famous residents have been towering exceptions — George and Barbara Bush, White House retirees who spent their days promoting literacy and volunteerism and their evenings at ballgames and gala dinners.

One night at the Houston Club, Mr. Bush was being honored by the Asia Society Texas Center, and as the dinner dragged on, Mrs. Bush leaned in close to the M.C. seated next to her.

“She kept on pulling my pant trousers to get my attention,” said the M.C., Charles C. Foster, a Houston lawyer who is a longtime friend of the Bush family. “She would say under her breath, ‘Hurry up. We go to bed by 10 o’clock.’ She was always blunt and salty.”

Mr. Bush was the first and only former American president to call Houston home, and both he and his wife helped raise the city’s global profile. They dined at the famously tony Tony’s, or had Tex-Mex at Molina’s Cantina, or Chinese at Yao. Anyone curious about just how much Houston adored the Bushes need only look at the couple’s pets. Mr. Bush may have had an airport named for him and Mrs. Bush may have had a library named for her, but three of their dogs have parks honoring them: Millie Bush Bark Park (named for their late English springer spaniel) and the Bibi and Mini-Me Bush Dog Park.

“Barbara Pierce Bush was best known to the world as the wife of a president and the mother of another, but in Houston we also knew her as a local leading light, an achiever in her own right who spoke and acted from the heart and the gut,” the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, said in a statement.

Mrs. Bush was the matriarch of a Republican family in a Democratic-leaning city, yet seemed above politics, or maybe just off to the side of it.

In November 2009, Annise D. Parker won the Houston mayor’s race, becoming the first openly gay mayor of a major American city. During the campaign, Ms. Parker, a Democrat, had won a key Republican endorsement — from Mrs. Bush. Years later, during her tenure as mayor, Ms. Parker saw Mrs. Bush at an event.

“She looked at me and she said she thought I had done an excellent job as mayor,” recalled Ms. Parker, who served as mayor from 2010 to 2016. “And she said, ‘I like your style. You could have been a Bush.’ And that’s one of the highest compliments that anyone’s ever paid me. She’s from the Northeast, but in a lot of ways she personifies what we expect of Texas women: tough and honest and occasionally sharp- tongued.”

Mrs. Bush, a native of New York, met her future husband in 1941 at a dance in Connecticut. The couple eventually moved to West Texas, and then settled in Houston in the late 1950s.

Houston played a role — albeit a small, scenic one — in one of Mrs. Bush’s most important decisions. It was the summer of 1978, and she was jogging in Memorial Park, the Central Park of Houston. She had struggled to pick a cause that she could throw herself behind, and landed on one during her jog — literacy. “Finally, after much thought, I realized everything I worried about would be better if more people could read, write and comprehend,” she wrote in her 1994 autobiography, “Barbara Bush: A Memoir.”

She will soon make one last pass through Memorial Park. Following the funeral service at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church in Houston on Saturday morning, the Bush family motorcade will travel through the park on its way to College Station, where Mrs. Bush will be buried that afternoon at Texas A&M University, on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Library and Museum.

Mrs. Bush left behind not one single legacy, but a collection of them.

There is Barbara Bush Elementary School, which opened in 1992 in Houston and which Mrs. Bush returned to, year after year, to read to the students. There is the Barbara Bush branch library and the Barbara Bush Literacy Plaza outside the central library downtown. There is the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation. After Hurricane Harvey, the Barbara Bush Houston Literacy Foundation and the Laura Bush Foundation for America’s Libraries pledged a combined $2 million, in part to rebuild storm-damaged libraries and provide school supplies in Houston and elsewhere.

“If you had to sum up the post-presidency legacy of President Bush and Barbara Bush — you couldn’t separate one from the other — if you had to say one thing, it was this incredible focus on Houston,” said Mr. Foster, the longtime friend of the Bushes.

Legacies are elusive, intangible things. But there is at least one place in Houston where Mrs. Bush’s legacy regularly comes to life, loudly and joyously — at Barbara Bush Elementary, every Friday morning, when more than 800 children sing the Barbara Bush Song. “Barbara Bush is our school’s name, from a grand first lady it came,” they sing. “Our school puts us to the test, helping us to do our best. To our school we’ll always be true, Barbara Bush we’re proud of you. Proud of you.”Larry and Sergey just yelled at us until we became what they needed us to become, and get done what they needed to be done. And so I said, look, I’m going to just rinse and repeat that, hopefully with less yelling. We ultimately brought in management coaches and all kinds of mentoring.

I think you can have high expectations as a leader, and as long as they’re consistent and clearly communicated, a lot of people find that really inspiring. I always knew what Larry and Sergey wanted. I knew what good looked like to them, and so I never got discouraged by them saying, “Wait, I don’t think this is ready” or “I think this is overly ready.” At a start-up you never really know when should you launch something. So Google built the philosophy of launching early and often. Try things out and see what works.

As Google grew, how did you work to maintain a cohesive culture?

There are different phases of companies. When you’re in the tens of people, the idea itself either attracts people or it doesn’t. People are there because they think the problem you’re trying to solve is just that important.

The next phase is where it’s really critical and it’s hard. Getting from 100 employees to 1,000, you have to be very careful. There’s a strategy around compensation at that point, where you really want somebody who’s coming for the right reasons. To get the people who are really aligned with the mission, you want to make sure that they’re fairly compensated, but not necessarily motivated by that compensation. I had a strategy both at Yahoo and at Google of “meet, not beat.” It’s the trade-off between mercenaries and missionaries.

And then around 1,000 people, the culture and the mission become self-reinforcing. At Google I’d always ask new people, “Why did you come?” When we were about 1,200 people, all of a sudden, for the first time, I actually heard the answer, “I came for the culture.”

“I’m proud of what we achieved at Yahoo. That said, we had a quickly decaying legacy business. All we really managed to do was offset the declines.”

— Marissa Mayer

Why did you leave Google?

I was 37, and I had been working at Google for 13 years. I had been on search for 10 of those years and just had very recently made the change over to focus on Maps as a search technology. And I was like, “You know, I’m just not sure that I want to be like the 50-year-old search girl.”

I’d always had huge respect for Yahoo as a company. When we were here in this office, we dreamed of maybe getting the Yahoo contract, maybe one day powering Yahoo search. In 1999, Yahoo was the internet. And I knew that while there were a lot of things going wrong for the board and leadership at Yahoo, there were a lot of really good people there working on the products.On the days it doesn’t come so easily, you can fill the white space with you. Who is to say where Picasso ends and Mr. Banderas begins? Who can give that information now that he’s prepared for this role three separate times?

Kenneth Biller, a creator of the show, and Ron Howard, an executive producer, immediately thought of Mr. Banderas for the role. They worried that they’d have to convince him to play the part, but he jumped up (pop!) and agreed to do it. He had recently happened upon the first season of “Genius,” with Geoffrey Rush as Albert Einstein, while cruising on his Apple TV. He watched the whole thing in two days.

“Genius: Picasso,” which takes place over 10 episodes, is shot during two eras: Picasso’s youth, and his old age. In his younger days, he is played by Alex Rich, who does a Picasso impression that is actually an Antonio Banderas impression. The camera follows Mr. Rich to show the freneticism of youth. But during the old age scenes, the camera stays still, like a portrait with Mr. Banderas entering and leaving it. In those scenes, it’s Mr. Banderas who supplies the energy.

How wonderful. How wonderful to find in your late 50s a character that’s been so meaningful. You can maybe understand that after all the years of masks and tangos and needing to drip with Andalusian lust, it’s nice to play someone who is considered a genius. Oh yes, it is nice to finally play someone who has touched greatness.

HAD MR. BANDERAS stayed in Spain, this would have been an entirely different story. He would have continued on the path Mr. Almodóvar had set for him, playing men with depth and inner lives. But he didn’t — he couldn’t.

He grew up going to the theater with his parents: plays by Lope de Vega, Pedro Calderón de la Barca. He marveled at theater as an act of civilization. “It was so beautiful,” he said. “We are all here and we have an agreement. We’re going to sit down here and you’re going to tell me a story and you have to make me believe it. And I thought, ‘This is [expletive] magical.’” He wanted to be on the other side of the theater. He wanted to be onstage.

But his parents had seen how artists were treated under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco. Many were exiled. His mother was distraught. “Don’t be an actor,” she pleaded. “Be something dignified.” He thought maybe he’d be a soccer player instead.

Then in 1976, the year after Franco died, an American theater company came through Málaga with “Hair” and it was just over for Mr. Banderas. “Oh, my God. What is this? What is this beard and this long hair and this freedom?,” he remembered thinking. He told his parents, “I have to do this. I have to do this type of theater. This is theater that is revolutionary.”

In 1981, while sitting at Café Gijón in Madrid, a man with a red briefcase held court telling funny stories. Mr. Banderas had long hair and a mustache for a role in a play. The man looked at him and said: “You should do film cinema. You are very romantic and you have a romantic face.” Mr. Banderas said, “O.K. Cool.” Afterward, he asked other patrons if anyone knew who the man was. “They said to me: ‘He’s called Pedro Almodóvar. He made one movie’” — he had, in fact, already made two feature films and several shorts — “‘but he’s not going to make any more.’”

Two days later, Mr. Almodóvar came to see Mr. Banderas in the play. In the dressing room afterward, he asked Mr. Banderas if he wanted to do a movie with him. “Sure,” Mr. Banderas said. Their first movie was the 1982 comedy “Labyrinth of Passion,” in which he plays a terrorist.

They made six more movies together. He played complex, brooding men — people with souls. In Spain, for Mr. Almodóvar, the soul was inherent in the character. Later, in the United States, working for American directors, Mr. Banderas had to create his characters’ souls.

He had a choice. He could go back to Spain and work with great directors — the star system there revolves around auteurs, not actors — and there was no shortage of deep, complex roles for him.

His fellow Hispanic actors asked him, “So, are you going to stay in America?” He told them, “Well, I don’t know. Maybe. Yeah.” They told him, “Well, if you stay here you’re going to be the bad guy, number one.” They told him he would only ever get cast as a member of a cartel or a gang.

But it was too late. By 1996, he was married to Melanie Griffith. They had a daughter, Stella. He had grown attached to his stepchildren. The question became one not of artistic fulfillment but of practicality. “How can I keep my career here? I’m married here. I live here. I have to play here.”

And he loved America. “The culture here.” He shimmered with delight. “There is something very beautiful about America, very innocent. Oh, yes. It’s still new. It’s innocent.”

I expressed some surprise. Over the course of my time in Hungary with him, we’d gotten word of the mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla. America had become horrifying to me. “Yes,” he said. “But you guys believe. You believe everything — even in this moment you believe.” In Europe, he said, people are skeptical. There’s the weight of history. But America, man. “I love NASA. I love those institutions. And I remember visiting Houston and going there and me doing my eyes like this.” He made his eyes big and full of disbelief.

Photo

And the innovation! “These people that invent Googles and Apples and all these companies, they put heart in the skies. Elon Musk doing this thing is unbelievable to me.”

So he played what he called the “exotic guy.” His agent told him he’d become more powerful the more he said no. “But,” he would say. “I have a problem here because I have to build a career almost handicapped.” He knew he was offered jobs that weren’t quite the best, jobs that had been offered to five or 10 actors before him.

“I cannot play in the same league as certain American actors because my accent didn’t allow me just to play a banker from New York or an astronaut,” he said. “So I have to be balancing. And it’s almost like the guy in the circus that tried to keep all the plates going. And if he stops they fall. And so I did have to do in my career things that I wouldn’t have done, yes.” What could he do? “It was a desert for Spanish actors.”

But lately, a strange thing started happening. He’s not being asked to wear matador outfits anymore. At the ripe (but still extremely handsome) age of 57, the roles got better. “They have more weight, they are more complex, they are more profound and I enjoy more to play them because you can just actually find many different ways to play,” he said. “It’s almost like a pot and you can’t stop putting things in. Before it was a uniform almost. They wanted the heroic, the epic, the guy.”

Photo

Maybe it’s the Hispanic population coming of age, he wondered. Great numbers with advanced degrees and a real presence in cinema. “Now it’s normal to see at the Academy Awards Mexican directors taking Oscars, Spanish actors, actors from Puerto Rico.”

But it could also be him. It could also be that there’s something about transforming small caricatures into great, big, memorable characters. All that time working to stay in business — as opposed to working to keep up an image — paid off. He subverted America’s attempts to objectify him. He took artistic risks. He became adept at infusing soul into one-note characters (I’m talking what could have been a throwaway role in “Miami Rhapsody;” I’m talking the Nasonex bee.)

That’s the thing about Picasso: He was considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and he was also prolific. He wasn’t cheap with his talents. He didn’t think that to practice his art would be to drain the supply of his artistry. He knew that was not how greatness works.



AT THE END of the day, Mr. Banderas sat in the makeup trailer as a woman applied glue remover to his head with a paintbrush, then pulled at the netting that hosted the white hair he’d been wearing. She did the same for his eyebrows, where there was a shadow of stubble. They began to work their fingers at the silicone that covered his face. He liked to help free himself from it.

Mr. Banderas lives in England now, in Surrey, about an hour southwest of London. He lives there with his girlfriend, Nicole Kimpel, an investment adviser he met at Cannes a few years ago.

The truth is, he doesn’t need to be in America anymore. So many movie shoots are done in Europe now for tax reasons. And Ms. Kimpel has an identical twin sister who lives in Switzerland whom she can’t bear to be too far away from.

What did he need to stay in the United States for anyway? His days of co-parenting are over. Stella is off at the University of Southern California, studying cinema. Of his divorce from Ms. Griffith in 2015 he says: “Melanie is a very generous woman and an excellent mother and a great lover for many years. But there is a moment that things were not working and before we started damaging each other we just decided to take that option.”

Here’s the truth about why Antonio Banderas stayed in the States for so long. Yes, he got married. Yes, he loved NASA and the Googles. Yes, he loved our innocence. But you know what else? He won’t say it, almost out of fealty to the country he was born in, but Ms. Hayek and Mr. Rodriguez will. In Spain, Ms. Hayek said, “He could not do some of the action movies. He’d never been on Broadway.”

Photo

In Spain he could do a lot of interesting work. But in the U.S., he can be an action star, a comedy hero, a Nasonex bee, a spy dad. In Spain he could be in the theater, yes, but in America, he can be on Broadway. That year he was in “Nine?” Mr. Banderas said it was his happiest time in America.

That’s who Antonio Banderas is. “He’s someone who wants to eat the world,” Mr. Rodriguez told me.

You can’t just eat the world from Europe, though. That’s the thing about being an actor in America. When you’re famous here, you’re famous everywhere. Mr. Banderas stayed here because Spain simply wasn’t big enough for him.

In Hungary, sitting in his makeup chair in the set of “Picasso,” Mr. Banderas said, “It’s hard to look into the mirror and see a doddering old man.” He didn’t take his eyes off himself when he spoke. “Picasso is 67 here. I’m two-and-a-half years away from 60. It’s not so far away.” He tilted his head, evaluating his cheek. “It’s scary to visit an age before you get there. But it’s somehow even scarier when it’s not that far away.”

Photo

About a year ago, Mr. Banderas was preparing breakfast in his home when his arm began to hurt. He’d had an arrhythmia issue for years, and one of his doctors in Los Angeles had told him he had a blockage in one of his arteries. He’d been under a lot of stress recently — the divorce, the move. He filmed seven movies that year. He was smoking. The pain in his arm was faint, but suddenly he felt it in his jaw. That’s when he knew: He was having a heart attack.

He was in the hospital for just a day. As the nurse, who was a fan, said goodbye to him, she said: “Antonio, you’re going to be very sad. For like a month or two months you’ll be very sad because the hearts hold feelings. And you’re going to feel like the world is crumbling around you. Don’t worry because you can put it back where it was and be the happy person that you are and continue doing your work.”

He didn’t think much of it, but as he recuperated, he found that he couldn’t shake his sadness. It engulfed him. It was like nothing he’d ever felt before. “Suddenly, you discover at your root level that it can be like in a second you can say goodbye.”

But he’s Antonio Banderas, so eventually the sadness made way for a different feeling: inspiration. He was still here. He was still here and he had so much left to do.

Photo

The first script he read after his heart attack was “Life Itself,” written and directed by Dan Fogelman (“This Is Us”). Mr. Banderas read to the last page and he knew he’d found his next project, a drama about intersecting lives in Spain and America. He was offered the role of a “normal” character — not a historical figure, not a masked avenger, not a slutty cat. Just a real man.

During filming, he was different than usual. “I was not so anxious about what is going to be the result of this, what is going to be their opinions. No, it was about me. It was — well, it’s very genuine because actually I love this profession. What about that? I love this profession.”

After that, “things magically start happening. Picasso came walking into my life.”

The silicone was now gone from his face. The hair was, too. He looked like a beautiful egg. Every day when the makeup came off, he was relieved to see that he was still there underneath. It’s scary to get old. Maybe it’s even scarier because you still have all the energy in the world, I suggested, and you feel like you haven’t done the thing you’ll be remembered for yet.

He smiled. I took him too literally, he said. It’s not that he doesn’t think he’ll be remembered for what he’s already done. It’s just that … Did he tell me the story yet about what Dalí supposedly used to say? “He used to say, ‘I am a very mediocre painter for the reason that I don’t want to die. In fact, I am the best painter in the world but I don’t paint a good painting because if I paint a good painting I will die the next day. So I prefer to be mediocre.’”

He gave me a combination [laughing with mouth open emoji] and [eyerolling emoji]. Ay, was Dalí crazy. Didn’t he know? Dignity comes when it’s required. Didn’t he know? Greatness only gets greater the more it’s practiced. Oh yes. That’s how greatness works.Ms. Dickinson was one of five women who testified during the first week of the trial, saying that they believed they had been drugged and sexually assaulted by Mr. Cosby. Prosecutors for the Montgomery County district attorney’s office called the witnesses to support the testimony of Andrea Constand, the woman who Mr. Cosby is charged with drugging and sexually assaulting at his home near here in 2004.

Ms. Regan said she published the book, but the writing and editing had been done by a ghost writer and editor. Under questioning by M. Stewart Ryan, an assistant district attorney, Ms. Regan said she believed Ms. Dickinson’s claim that she had been raped, saying she found her “credible” and Ms. Dickinson had given her account “with great emotion.”

Ms. Regan, 64, currently the head of the Regan Arts division of Phaidon Press, was part of the final day of evidence presentation by prosecutors. She also published O.J. Simpson’s confessional book “If I Did It,” under her imprint, Regan Books, which was a subdivision of News Corp.

In the afternoon, lawyers for Mr. Cosby began to mount a defense intended to undermine Ms. Constand’s credibility. They have described Ms. Constand as a con artist who they say has fabricated the details of a consensual sexual encounter in order to score a big payday from Mr. Cosby, who paid her $3.38 million in a settlement that closed a 2005 lawsuit she had filed against him.

During that lawsuit, Mr. Cosby acknowledged in a deposition that he had once obtained quaaludes, a powerful sedative, to give to women he wanted to have sex with.

That testimony was read out loud to the jury in the courtroom on Wednesday, as part of the prosecution’s effort to show that Mr. Cosby had a predilection for using drugs to incapacitate women.

Mr. Cosby’s lawyer had objected to the reading, suggesting there was no evidence that the three pills Mr. Cosby acknowledges giving Ms. Constand at his home were quaaludes. Mr. Cosby has said they were Benadryl.

According to a transcript of the 2005 deposition read in court, Mr. Cosby had been asked by Ms. Constand’s attorney, Dolores Troiani: “When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?”

“Yes,” Mr. Cosby had replied.For a first lady famously and proudly uninterested in fashion, focused rather on literacy and her family, it was a strategic choice. The pearls reflected her approach to the job — practical, with humor and an understanding of tradition — and her personality in a way that allowed women around the world to relate. They acknowledged the exigencies of the White House and the unelected, often silent, but very visible role that is first lady, with all the expectations of first hostess and first helpmate that implies, with respect but without fuss or frippery.

In a patrician, dynastic family such as the Bushes, this created no small public relations counterpart and advantage.

It began at her husband’s 1989 inaugural ball, when Mrs. Bush appeared in a royal blue velvet gown with an asymmetric velvet bodice and draped satin skirt by Arnold Scassi (Scaasi being something of her go-to couturier) topped by a triple strand of pearls from Kenneth Jay Lane, the New York costume jeweler. The dress was elegant, but the pearls, declared to be faux, were a global hit, so much so that Mr. Lane renamed the necklace the “Barbara Bush pearls,” acknowledging Mrs. Bush’s role as an influencer longer before the term even existed.

They signaled, in their (relative) affordability, a break with the Reagan administration, and set off a trend for pearls, real and faux, in the jewelry industry — especially as it seemed Mrs. Bush so rarely took them off. As Mark Gurdus, vice president of sales for Marvella jewelry, told United Press International not long after Mrs. Bush moved into the White House, “Barbara Bush wearing them every night on the 6 p.m. news is really not hurting.”

According to the Kenneth Jay Lane website, where the Bush pearls continue to be sold (for $150), “the former first lady wore the three-strand necklace so often she said that, if she took it off, her head would fall off.”

They became her signature. She wore them with suits, with dresses, to casual events and state dinners, and she continued to do so long after her husband left office. She wore them when she met visiting dignitaries, and when she was photographed with her dog, Millie. She wore them on the cover of her official memoir, and on the cover of the coming biography, “The Matriarch,” by Susan Page, Mrs. Bush is pictured wearing a bright red coat and her three strands of pearls. They are now part of the historical record: the strands she wore to the inauguration were donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1990.

Early in the Bushes’ White House tenure, Mrs. Bush’s deputy press secretary, Jean Becker, told U.P.I. that the first lady wore the fake pearls because she “just liked them.” But in a 2015 interview with her granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager, Mrs. Bush joked that she used them to cover the wrinkles on her neck. Both the attitude and the actuality are now a part of her legacy. She wore them well.The actress and playwright Danai Gurira was born in Iowa but grew up in Zimbabwe. That may be an explanation for why, when it comes to beauty, Ms. Gurira, who plays the kick-butt General Okoye in “Black Panther,” finds fun in variety. Now living in New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta, Ms. Gurira, 40, will be reprising Okoye for “Avengers: Infinity War,” out later this month. Find out what beauty staples she’s leaning into lately.

Skin Care

I really feel like I’ve been on a constant journey on how to enjoy beauty, and it’s about the things you pick up along the way. I started experimenting with makeup in my teens. Sometimes I do a little less; sometimes I do a little more. Often I just use CeraVe. It’s a gentle cleanser and good for combination skin. I also like having a hyaluronic acid component in my routine.

Then I use a lot of Sisley. My makeup artist introduced me to Sisley when I was battling dehydration in the dead of winter in New York. She used the Black Rose Cream Mask on me, which is really less of a mask and more of a cream. It was really great for my skin, and now I always have it for long flights. I also use the mattifying moisturizer, which is oil free. And I have their lip stuff. It’s just a lip balm, but it’s pretty fantastic.

I’ve been on set a lot lately, and that’s when I really stick with what works for me. The worst thing would be to disrupt my skin care. If I’m going to be in the sun, I might add the Sisley All Day All Year, which has sun protection. I’ll also use Clarins Beauty Flash Balm before I put on makeup. It’s hydrating and glow-y. I use it religiously.

Makeup

I definitely take what I learn from the pros and apply it to what I do at home. Lately I’ve really grown to love a good lip. Sometimes I’ll do something subtle, and sometimes I’ll go for it — it depends on what I’m wearing. My makeup artist ends up giving me a lot of lip products because I’m a germophobe and don’t to want to share. I have a great collection. I use a lot of Chanel lipstick for the bold colors. They have a really great variety of reds that work on my skin tone. For my character on “Black Panther,” I brought out my own Chanel lipstick in Etienne, which is like a burgundy red. It worked so well, it became part of my character.While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said.

If the proposed law is passed, anyone indicted on state charges after being convicted in federal court and then pardoned would likely challenge the state law in court. But Mr. Schneiderman wrote in the letter that he and his advisers were confident the legislation would withstand any constitutional scrutiny.

Even though New York is a reliably blue state, Mr. Schneiderman’s proposal is hardly a foregone conclusion, given the narrow political divide in the State Senate.

“We are disturbed by reports that the president is considering pardons of individuals who may have committed serious federal financial, tax, and other crimes — acts that may also violate New York law,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement provided by his office.

“We must ensure that if the president, or any president, issues such pardons, we can use the full force of New York’s laws to bring such individuals to justice.”

The White House had no immediate response.

The president has openly discussed his pardon powers, and reportedly even asked his aides whether he could pardon himself, though one of his lawyers denied it.

“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon,” he tweeted last year, “why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.”

Just last week, when lawyers for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who is himself the subject of a criminal investigation apparently unrelated to Mr. Mueller’s probe, were in court clashing with prosecutors over a search warrant, Mr. Trump pardoned former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.

Mr. Schneiderman’s move has the potential to set off a battle in the State Senate, where Republicans have narrowly controlled the chamber through alliances with Democrats. Earlier this month, though, most Democrats in the chamber ended a long-running feud, which has left a degree of doubt over long-term control of the body. An April 24 special election in Westchester County could determine who will lead the chamber.

The measure would likely be supported by Mr. Cuomo, who is tacking left in the face of a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist. The state’s Assembly has long been a bulwark of liberal ideals.

Mr. Schneiderman’s move is likely to inflame allies of Mr. Trump, who see Mr. Schneiderman as an opportunist bent on making political hay, and whom they see as unlikely to treat Mr. Trump fairly.

This is hardly the first time Mr. Schneiderman has challenged Mr. Trump.

A month before the 2016 election, his office ordered Mr. Trump’s foundation to stop raising money in New York amid scrutiny over Mr. Trump’s claims about charitable giving. The $25 million settlement over Trump University came little more than a week after the election. Mr. Schneiderman called the settlement “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”

The attorney general’s office has also investigated Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who was indicted on federal charges last year, though he deferred his inquiry amid the federal investigation.

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution has a double jeopardy clause that says “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” But that applies to multiple prosecutions of the same federal offense.

The states are almost evenly split between those that have additional double jeopardy protections at the state level and those that do not. And Mr. Schneiderman has successfully backed changes to the double jeopardy law before. In 2011, the state closed what was known as the “Helmsley loophole,” named for the headline-grabbing hotelier Leona Helmsley, allowing it to prosecute tax cheats who had already been prosecuted federally.

“New York’s statutory protections could result in the unintended and unjust consequence of insulating someone pardoned for serious federal crimes from subsequent prosecution for state crimes,” Mr. Schneiderman writes in his letter, “even if that person was never tried or convicted in federal court, and never served a single day in federal prison.”

Whether Mr. Schneiderman’s office would even seek to become involved in a criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump or his aides remains to be seen. But his move only adds to Mr. Trump’s legal problems.

Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have pleaded guilty in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, including Rick Gates, a former campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. Earlier this month, the Southern District of New York, an office of the Justice Department outside of Mr. Mueller’s, revealed it was investigating Mr. Cohen.

Mr. Trump has made his feelings about these investigations plain in a recent tweet that said, simply, “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”“They are looking for what he calls ‘loopholes,’ and what we call protections, and trying to close them,” said Wendy Young, the executive director of Kids In Need of Defense, a nonprofit organization that represents young immigrants who come to the country unaccompanied. “Under this administration, everybody is presenting a fraudulent claim, rather than, ‘Why is this child here and do they need protection?’”

So far, at least 81 applicants from the New York City area have been denied or were told they would soon be denied by the immigration agency, according to The Legal Aid Society of New York. In total, more than 1,000 young people across the state, not all of them from Central America, could be affected.

Although there are other states that follow a process similar to New York’s, including California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington, lawyers believe that New York has seen the most denials.

In the last week, the Legal Aid Society said, the immigration agency has also sent a handful of notices to New York-area clients saying they were going to revoke applications that had previously been approved.

“When do immigrants get to rely on decisions from U.S.C.I.S.?” asked Eve Stotland, the legal director for The Door, an organization that works with disadvantaged youth in New York. “What if the client is naturalized? You spin into a place of arbitrariness and absurdity, and a failure to follow the rule of law.”

Jonathan Withington, a spokesman for the agency, said: “U.S.C.I.S. has not issued any new guidance or policy directives regarding the adjudication of S.I.J. petitions. We remain committed to adjudicating each petition individually based on the merits of the case and safeguarding the integrity of our lawful immigration system.”

The federal law establishing Special Immigrant Juvenile status was first enacted as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 and then expanded in 2008. To obtain it, applicants must first have a ruling from their state’s juvenile court, finding that they have been abused, abandoned or neglected. A judge must also declare the young person dependent on the court, or appoint a caretaker. In the second part of the process, the applicant submits the judge’s order to the immigration agency.

The Trump administration seems to be narrowly reinterpreting the law, saying that in cases where applicants are over 18, they no longer qualify, because the state court’s authority ends at that age. According to its reasoning in one denial letter provided to The Times, “once a person attains the age of 18, the family courts lack jurisdiction over the person’s custody.”

Those over 18 can be appointed guardians, however, which the immigration agency now does not consider the same as custody. Lawyers say that’s semantics, since in state law, guardianship and custody have equal rights and responsibilities.

“Nothing in the federal statutes has changed; only the interpretation has changed,” Beth Krause, the supervising attorney for the Immigrant Youth Project at The Legal Aid Society of New York, said. “And now, U.S.C.I.S. is interpreting this in a way to cut out a very large portion of kids who, until the past couple of weeks, had gotten these grants under the same facts.”

“It’s a bad faith argument,” said Rebecca McBride, a lawyer at Atlas: DIY, a nonprofit organization helping immigrant youth in Brooklyn, who represents several people with special immigrant status.

The immigration agency declined to explain the change, saying in an email response, “A petitioner must submit a court order issued by a juvenile court that contains specific determinations made under relevant state law.” It referred to a policy manual rewritten in October 2016. The agency pointed to the dramatic increase in SIJ applications in recent years, with 11,335 approved applications in 2017 compared with 1,590 in 2010, with the greatest increase coming after the surge of Central American minors coming to the U.S. in 2014.

Consider the case of J., a shy young man, now 22, from Burkina Faso. He went to family court in New York in late 2016 when he was 20, and the court granted him an order that enabled him to apply to the immigration agency. He received two requests for more information before being denied because of his age several weeks ago.“At the moment of application, if they had this issue about 18 years old, why would they allow me to continue this if that’s what they thought?” J. said, in French, with his lawyer at The Door. “Why would they let this whole family court thing happen? Why would they allow this to advance to this point and now decide?”He and other young immigrants interviewed asked to be identified only by their first initial or first name because of fear of repercussions from the government.

J.’s lawyer at The Door is appealing the denial.

Y., another client of The Door, came to the United States in August 2016, and at the end of that year, when she was 20, obtained a special findings order from the New York family court. She said she had also been threatened with rape by a gang in Honduras because she was a lesbian. That would seem, her lawyer said, to make it “in the best interests of the child” not to send her back — another part of the law.

Y. was denied, but her younger brother, A., who had come to the United States in 2015 and also applied when he was over 18, was approved in February 2016.

“The government wants to pick and choose who is and isn’t a child, but in fact it’s a matter of law,” Ms. Stotland said.

Legal organizations say they first started seeing signs that the government was holding up the special immigrant applications in the later years of the Obama administration, but the trend became more pronounced in the spring of 2017, when the agency started asking for more information about applications.

Romain, 23, was 4 years old when his parents were murdered in Congo, in the house where he was sleeping. His uncle took him to Burkina Faso, and 14 years later sent him to the United States to study. Then the uncle cut all ties with him, Romain says, leaving him in New York, alone, broke and homeless.

Romain came on a student visa, but without money to pay for college, it lapsed. He landed in a homeless shelter for boys.

In 2015, when Romain was 20, he applied for special immigrant status with the help of Ms. McBride at Atlas: DIY. A family court in Brooklyn found that he fit the criteria that year, but upon further review, the federal immigration agency caught a discrepancy they believed was fraud. Romain’s uncle had filled out his student visa application incorrectly, saying the young man’s parents were alive, so the application was initially denied.

That complicated the appeal process, but Ms. McBride and Romain persisted, finding sufficient evidence of his parents’ death, which the government eventually believed. But in Spring 2017, Ms. McBride said, the agency said that death was not akin to abandonment. And, finally, this winter, the agency added the over-18 stipulation to its notice of intent to deny Romain’s application. She submitted an appeal, and they are waiting.

“I am extremely frustrated, I’m confused,” Romain said, “but I am always thinking that if the interpretation of those rules can be changed today, the same interpretation can be changed tomorrow — for the better.”“I had a lot of things on my list that I really want to do, and suddenly I had a lot of time on my hands to do them,” said Siegemund, who has ranked as high as 27th in the world. “All of these things came to my mind at the same time, so it kind of pushed away the negative about it.”

Siegemund, 30, relished spending more time with loved ones and further exploring psychology, the subject of the bachelor’s degree from the University of Hagen. She hopes to pursue an advanced degree in the field someday, but during her time off, she read books on the topic and emphasized it in corporate speaking engagements.

“I was speaking in front of companies and also the tennis federation, different kinds of audiences about psychological subjects,” Siegemund said. “Of course it was from the perspective of a professional athlete, but I tried to take it a little further, transferring what we experience on the court. I think you can transfer it to any area of life and business. I kind of liked that, to give my perspective on these things.”

Siegemund’s undergraduate thesis focused on a topic intrinsic to her life as a tennis player: choking under pressure. She says her expertise in the area does not necessarily protect her from collapsing.

“It does help me to have extra knowledge, but being able to apply it in these situations is a whole different thing,” she said. “Theory and practice are two completely different things. But it’s good to have the theory to try to apply it.”

On court, Siegemund is known as a dogged competitor with a ruthlessness that often unnerves her opponents.

“I think part of her game is to find out how to irritate the other person a little bit,” said Naomi Osaka, a recent opponent.

Siegemund said she had applied some of that same relentlessness to her rehabilitation process.

“I drive the people around me crazy sometimes because I’m very impatient, and if it’s not going forward, I can be a hard one to deal with,” she said. “But I’m getting up at 7, and I’m the first one to go in the place and the last one to go out. That’s a good thing about it also, but maybe sometimes it would be nice to be more relaxed and not be so competitive with it.”

Working diligently, Siegemund was ready for a return last month, but decided to wait until the tour shifted away from hardcourts.

“I had the doctors’ recommendation that I have to start on clay,” she said. “And also this is my favorite surface, so those two things came together.”

After playing one small tournament in Italy, Siegemund returned to the WTA Tour and won her first match on April 2 at the Volvo Car Open in this island community near Charleston. She lost in the second round to Osaka, the recent Indian Wells champion, after holding four set points in the second set.

Siegemund feels confident in her knee, she said, but still wears a large brace on her right leg for some physical and mental reassurance.

“I do want to take it off,” she said, laughing. “It doesn’t look very pretty, it’s really ugly. Maybe a shout-out to all the people that make braces, maybe they can do something nice instead of this.”

Siegemund, who notched five wins against top-10 players on clay last year, said she did not dwell on what might have been during her recovery, even though the French Open yielded many upsets, including the championship victory by an unseeded Jelena Ostapenko.

“I’m not on that hypothetical trip so much,” Siegemund said. “What happened to me, I had to deal with it. I saw it as a task I had to manage, and I think that helped me to get through all of it in a positive way, and really come back stronger, a little bit, from it.”

Siegemund’s next tournament will be next week in Stuttgart, where last year she won her second WTA title. In addition to the trophy and prize money, Siegemund earned a car from Porsche, the title sponsor of the event. The company did a custom paint job in “frozen berry,” a color that Siegemund described as purplish taupe, and by the time the car was finished, its owner could not bend her knee enough to get in.

Siegemund said she was not putting pressure on herself to succeed quickly, but she has not dimmed her expectations after returning to tour as what she considers a better-rounded player and person, while still hungry for on-court success.

“I don’t want to be where I was before — I want to be better than that,” she said. “But maybe in a different way.”They began rehearsals five weeks before the shooting and they insisted on continuing after. The show opens May 2.

As Broadway musicals go, “Spring Awakening,” with music by Duncan Sheik and book and lyrics by Steven Sater, is arguably the worst show that a town in South Florida could stage right now. Or if you believe in catharsis, in theater’s ability to transmute painful feelings into something constructive and cleansing, maybe it’s the best.

Based on Frank Wedekind’s 1891 play, it’s a story of adolescents failed by an older generation, with tragic results. The character of Melchior, which vaulted Mr. Groff to stardom and is played here by the 17-year-old Never Again activist Cameron Kasky, sings a second-act number flanked by the ghosts of a dead friend and a dead lover.

But for many of the students, rehearsal has been a reprieve, a temporary escape from real-life dramas.

As Sawyer Garrity, 16, who plays Melchior’s lover Wendla (Ms. Michele’s role), said before rehearsal began: “Nothing has been normal. This isn’t even fully normal.” (Because of death threats some of the students have received, a police cruiser waits in the parking lot during every rehearsal.) “But this is the one place where I’m centered,” she said.

When the Broadway actor Gideon Glick read about the production in a New Yorker article, he reached out to its director, Christine Barclay, asking if a visit would be welcome. With her approval, he began to muster his former castmates.

Many of the actors had flown in that day. Several of them were bunking together at a house Remy Zaken had borrowed. Lilli Cooper couldn’t make it. She’s starring in “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical.” But she FaceTimed the girl playing Martha, her “Spring Awakening” role.

Theater-world support has become a part of this new not-normal. Every current Broadway show has provided the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Drama Club with signed posters or similar swag. The evening before this rehearsal some of the “Spring Awakening” student actors had performed alongside “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” cast members in a benefit concert called “From Broadway With Love.”

But even generosity can breed exhaustion and complicate grieving. After the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012, there were so many fund-raisers and celebrity stop-ins that Newtown’s first selectman requested an end to outside events in town.

With that in mind, Mr. Glick hadn’t publicized the visit and he and Ms. Barclay had conceived it as a respite with occasional music, a chance for the young actors to chat “Hair” with Mr. Groff and “Glee” with Ms. Michele, to “feel good and supported,” he said, speaking by telephone the week before.

Photo

Ms. Barclay wanted that, too. But she also hoped that the professional actors could counsel the students on taking a character to a dark place without staying there yourself, on making it “not so personal and raw,” she said a few days before the Broadway actors arrived.

In the theater, after the breathless warm-up, the rehearsal began in earnest, with the original cast watching from three and four rows back. “They’re here to support your rehearsal. They’re not here to cast you in the next Broadway show,” Ms. Barclay said.

“I wish someone would cast me in the next Broadway show,” Skylar Astin, who played Georg onstage, murmured jokingly.

Performing in front of the invited guests wasn’t always easy. Alfonso Calderon, 17, had to mime masturbation right in front of what he called “his celebrity crushes and dreams.” He looked ashen when he finished the scene, though he still managed to compliment Mr. Astin on the “Pitch Perfect” movies.

The Broadway actors praised the vulnerability and even the discomfort of some of the student actors. “I can see in your faces and on your bodies what we felt as well when we were first doing the show,” Phoebe Strole said during a break. “It’s like taking your heart out of your chest and shoving it at us.”

“But you also have to be loud, guys,” Mr. Glick said, adding an apologetic, “I don’t want to be like a Jewish mother here.”

“Please Jewish mother them,” Ms. Barclay said. (A new mother herself, she’d brought her 2-month-old baby to the rehearsal.)

Eventually a prop gun required by the script would be used, but Ms. Barclay hadn’t introduced it yet. No one wanted to mention the shooting head-on, though there were some oblique references to Valentine’s Day.

When a question for the Broadway actors seemed to veer that way, Mr. Kasky, who had spent most of the rehearsal threatening to break into “Under the Sea” from “The Little Mermaid,” tensed up. “We want to talk less about the shooting,” he said. His character cried during a funeral scene in a way that seemed to bypass technique.

The professional actors had advice on handling the hard stuff.

“You choose when you want to use what you went through to cry or to laugh or do whatever, and if you don’t, if you just want to go into the song, you can do that, too,” Ms. Michele said.

The younger actors studied their counterparts as though searching for clues about what their own lives would be 12 years from now. But mostly they wanted to be near the people who had sung the same songs and mumbled the same speeches and known what it is to show up for rehearsal with a face full of pimples or perform a love scene when your own body is still a mystery.

“I felt like, ‘Am I going to have to pretend I have any clue what I’m doing?’” Mr. Groff confessed.“You’re exploiting your own vulnerability to make the work,” he said recently. And since artists mine their own lives for material, working relationships are necessarily personal. “If that’s betrayed, it’s a shockingly intimate form of betrayal,” he said. “It’s like a marriage breaking down.”

Matthew Warchus, the Old Vic’s artistic director, programmed “Mood Music” on that basis alone.

“It’s a really volatile subject: the paradox of two people fighting violently and emotionally over something that should be beautiful and life-enhancing,” he explained.

Mr. Penhall has a few close collaborations of his own — though none that have soured as starkly as those of his protagonists. This is, for instance, the fourth time he has worked with Roger Michell, who directed his breakthrough play, the psychiatric-hospital-set “Blue/Orange” in 2000. “There’s one collaborator who really gets you and you get them, and there’s something about that chemistry,” he said of Mr. Michell. “You have to trust them implicitly.”

“Mood Music” is not a #MeToo play — not directly. Written and programmed before allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein, there’s nothing sexually untoward between Mr. Penhall’s protagonists, played by Ben Chaplin and Seána Kerslake. Their relationship is as platonic as it is vitriolic, but in picking at the power dynamics of a creative industry, it feels entirely on point.

Stories of sexism in the music industry are rife — like the male critical response to Joni Mitchell or Björk’s recent complaints about ceding credit to her male collaborators. In February, an academic study by Stacey L. Smith of the University of Southern California found that, of the 600 most popular songs in the past five years, just 12.3 percent were written by women. Female producers were even more rare: sometimes as little as 2 percent.

Despite that, Mr. Penhall, who started his career as a cub music reporter (“I know what it’s like to be in a room with a rock star,” he said), doesn’t believe the music industry is “inherently patriarchal.” Rather, he blames commercialism: “You’re selling to a mass audience, and a mass audience isn’t necessarily forward thinking. The market is domineering and brutal and coercive.”

The effect is to turn people into products — particularly female artists, whose personal lives become part of the package. “It’s not just monetizing talent, it’s monetizing trauma,” Mr. Penhall said. “That’s true of every artist, whether you’re Picasso or Miley Cyrus, but I think it’s more acute with songs because it’s more naked. The whole industry has exploited heartbreak and sex.”

Photo

The Old Vic is on something of a roll — its musical “Girl from the North Country,” with songs by Bob Dylan, won two Oliviers this month, and Mr. Warchus said it would “certainly” come to New York — but it’s also dealing with the fallout of its own #MeToo moment. Until 2015, it was run by Kevin Spacey, one of the first people to face accusations of sexual harassment and assault.

Though Mr. Warchus stressed that the issue in this instance was about “a person rather than an institution,” he believes “Mood Music” cuts to the issue’s core. “The sexual side of things is the sensational side, the headline, but it’s not really the interesting side of any of this,” he said. “We really do need to have a hard think about how we deal with power, because people are always going to have power over others.”

Plenty of creative industries feed on hierarchical distinctions. “It happens in our world all the time,” Ms. Kerslake said. Actors end up kowtowing to producers and directors. “The funny part of our job is that you actually have to give over control sometimes.”

Playing such a toxic relationship onstage is a challenge of its own. Mr. Chaplin, who took on the producer part when Rhys Ifans dropped out for “family reasons,” recognizes the responsibility that comes with representing an abuse of power. “I don’t want it to appear easy,” Mr. Chaplin insisted. At the same time, acting such a part can take its toll: “Doing it night after night, you inevitably start feeling battered.”

Widely regarded as one of the sharpest script-polishers in Hollywood, Mr. Penhall has had his share of unsatisfying artistic encounters in an industry he likened to “a sausage factory.” He said he’s walked away from several sizable projects uncredited, including the Oscar-winning film “The Last King of Scotland.”

“I didn’t want a credit because I didn’t think it was worth a credit,” he said.

It’s his way of retaining creative control. “If it stinks, it stinks,” he said bluntly. “Life’s too short, and I don’t need the dough. Nobody needs money that much to traduce themselves.”

With “Mindhunter,” Mr. Penhall knew exactly what he was getting into: a big-budget setup with a collaborative writing process — “but I wanted to do that.” He submitted to its rigmarole, partly to work with the director David Fincher, but mostly for the chance to write something expansive. (And, as in many of his plays, the series, about the early days of the FBI’s criminal psychology unit, allows him to explore a favorite subject of his: abnormality.)

At it turned out, “Mindhunter” afforded Mr. Penhall more creative control than expected. “I was free,” he said. “I could write what I wanted to write. The budget was enormous. The subject was as dark as you could possibly get.”

“This is what’s glorious about how the industry’s evolved in the last couple of years,” he said of the advent of streaming services. “It’s now incumbent upon you to be as distinctive and original and challenging as possible. That’s the status quo.”

It might still be a production line, but, Mr. Penhall said, “you can still make your own sausages.”Photo

“Very nice and clean,” says the pretty maid with the artificial smile, speaking with the scripted sunniness of a corporate employee. She is talking about both the antiseptic-looking hotel room she is tidying and the country, Switzerland, in which it is located.

Certainly, no one looking at the crisply anonymous set for Amelia Roper’s “Zürich,” which opened on Monday night at Next Door at NYTW, would argue with that description. But don’t assume that the standards of moral hygiene are anywhere near as high for those who inhabit this dark, teasingly contrived comedy.

The 10 characters in “Zürich,” directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt in a polished Colt Coeur production, are human beings of the 21st century. They are, at best, a mess and, at worst, moral cesspools, polluted by greed, lust for power, political corruption and a system built on what one character refers to as “toxic masculinity.”

Described in the program as “an Australian-American writer and activist,” Ms. Roper lends a bracingly astringent perspective to life as we know it today. Even the children who scamper through her play — which takes place in a series of interchangeable rooms on the 40th floor of a luxury hotel — seem somehow tainted, as if born into the latter-day equivalent of original sin.

“Zürich” takes what might be called a terrorist approach to the classic omnibus comedies associated with the likes of Alan Ayckbourn and Neil Simon. I mean those plays in which disparate (and often desperate) lives, portrayed in separate scenes, turn out to be linked by both theme and circumstance.My qualification for dog guessing is that I spent my childhood studying the American Kennel Club breed book the way other kids studied baseball cards and automobile grills. It has stood me in good stead. My proudest moment in dog identification came when I correctly asked, about a small dog scurrying around a plant nursery in the Adirondacks, “Is that a Schipperke?”

Yes! It was.

I have also correctly identified Brussels Griffons on the leash in Manhattan.

But, faced with photographs of mixed breeds and having to pick more than one ancestral strain, I realized that I don’t really know anything about what happens when dogs interbreed. I am now a firm believer in getting mutts as pets, but I tend to think of all mutts as Labrador retrievers mixed with something, if they are big, or poodle mixes if they are small, with a few chihuahuas thrown in.

I’m not alone, apparently. Elinor Karlsson, a genetic researcher at the Broad Institute, who runs Darwin’s Dogs among other projects, said, “People look at dogs as a something and a something. Turns out that it’s way more complicated than that.”

The Darwin’s Dogs program — an attempt to draw on dog owners to build a database of purebred and mixed breed dogs — has been collecting DNA by asking dog owners to take a saliva sample and send it in, along with photos and answers to a very detailed questionnaire about the dog’s appearance and behavior. So far, it has 17,400 dogs signed up, and 400 dogs with their DNA sequenced. The program does not charge, so far, for the genetic sequencing, and does not promise an immediate result.

But from its own data and other canine genetic research, it has the answers on what breeds went into the making of each dog in the survey.

If you want quick results for your own dog, there are other ventures. Embark, a company founded by Adam Boyko, a dog geneticist at Cornell University, says it has the most accurate DNA test among commercial services.

For $199, an owner can send in a dog’s DNA, as you would if you were getting human DNA tested. His company tests 200,000 so-called genetic markers, or sites in the DNA, similar to the number tested at the Broad Institute. It then provides a complete report to the pet owners on the dog’s breed, or breeds and genetic health factors.

The goal of the MuttMix survey, for Dr. Karlsson, is to learn how good people are at identifying dog breeds.

More Reporting on Dogs

It may also serve to attract people to the Darwin’s Dogs project, which is of use both in studying dogs and in studying human health problems like Obsessive Compulsive Disease that have analogs in dogs.

As to the mutts in the survey, I can’t give anything away, but good luck with “Maxine,” and “Jack,” two dogs in the survey that stumped me.

If you get Maxine right, well, then, lah di dah. Not that I’m competitive, you understand.Vittorio Taviani was born on Sept. 29, 1929, in the Tuscan town of San Miniato. His father, Ermanno, was a lawyer, and his mother, the former Jolanda Brogi, was a teacher.

The main early exposure to culture for him and Paolo, who is two years younger, came not from movies, but from trips to Florence to see Verdi operas. One day in Pisa just after World War II, though, everything changed for them.

“By chance we happened to pass a local movie theater,” Mr. Taviani recalled in a 1986 interview with The New York Times. “And the people coming out were muttering, ‘Don’t go in, it’s an atrocity!’ So naturally we were curious. And there on the screen was everything that had happened to all of us just a few months before.

“Seeing it unreel before us was glorious and tragic,” he continued, “and we realized at once that film was the one means we had to understand our own reality. The movie was Rossellini’s ‘Paisan,’ and from that day on we knew that the cinema was the road for us.”

Neorealism was in vogue, thanks to the films of Roberto Rossellini, Luchino Visconti and others. That genre had faded by the time the Tavianis began working in the movie business in the mid-1950s, first behind the scenes, then directing documentaries. But when they began making features together in 1962 with “Un uomo da bruciare” (“A Man for Burning,” directed with Valentino Orsini), a drama about a union organizer, they were envisioning a variation on the filmmaking that had first caught their attention.

“We wanted to take the legacy of neo-realism and add to it the grandeur of the spettacolo — the panoramas of John Ford, the melodrama of Giotto’s frescoes,” Mr. Taviani said.

Although the brothers worked with top stars like Isabella Rossellini and Marcello Mastroianni, their films often used unknown actors. They drew on history and literature — their source material included Tolstoy, for “San Michele aveva un gallo” (“St. Michael Had a Rooster”) in 1972; and Luigi Pirandello, for “Kaos,” in 1984. They would mix panoramic shots with close-ups in which, as one review put it, “you can play connect the dots with the actors’ pores.”

Their formula for co-directing their more than 20 films was simple: They would alternate scenes, and when it was one brother’s turn to direct, the other would not actively interfere but would keep vigil at the video monitor.

“We have a very acute nonverbal, telepathic communication,” Vittorio Taviani told The Times in a 2013 interview. “If the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head, the other understands. So we have a silent meeting, we correct it, and then we go off again.”

Ideas would often be exchanged and scripts discussed while they walked their dogs together in a Rome park.

“In the sun or the rain or the snow we keep walking,” Mr. Taviani said in a 1986 interview with The Times, “and talk about whatever comes into our heads — movies, dogs, beautiful things, horrible ones, the things that make us angry. At some point a story might emerge from an anecdote or a memory, or a page from a book, and eventually we realize it has to be written down.”

Mr. Tornatore, for one, was envious.

“They thought in exactly the same way, almost as if they were the same person,” he said. “Like all directors who understood their prodigious mental organization, I envied them. Who wouldn’t want to have a brother with whom to share the difficulty of making films, without the work suffering even the most minimal stylistic incoherence?”

The brothers had directed a half-dozen features and received some showings at international festivals when, in 1977, their big break came with “Padre Padrone,” a film about a shepherd whose brutal father deprives him of an education but who goes on to become a well-regarded linguist nonetheless.

The film won the Palme d’Or, the top prize at Cannes, as well as the festival’s International Critics Prize. Janet Maslin, reviewing it in The Times, called it “vivid and very moving, coarse but seldom blunt, and filled with raw landscapes that underscore the naturalness and inevitability of the father‐son rituals it depicts.”

Among the brothers’ better-known later films are “La notte di San Lorenzo” (“The Night of the Shooting Stars,” 1982), a somewhat autobiographical tale about an Italian village at the end of World War II, and “Cesare deve morire” (“Caesar Must Die,” 2012), a fictional film about a production of “Julius Caesar” staged in a prison, for which the brothers cast real inmates and ex-convicts. It won the top prize, the Golden Bear, at the Berlin International Film Festival.

In addition to his wife and his brother Paolo, Mr. Taviani is survived by his children, Francesca, Giovanna and Giuliano Taviani; another brother, Franco; and three grandchildren.

After the release of “Caesar Must Die,” Vittorio Taviani, 83 at the time, was asked about future films.

“We’re sure that another one will come along, just as we’re sure about death,” he said. “I’m saying that in a beautiful realistic sense, considering our age.”Sammartino often feuded with promoters who arranged his matches. But he insisted that he never took a dive and held his titles legitimately in two reigns, from May 17, 1963, to Jan. 17, 1971, and from Dec. 10, 1973, to April 30, 1977. He lost a few matches: One foe threw salt in his eyes and pinned him while he groped about blindly; another leapt from the ring and ran off with his “diamond studded” championship belt. But these did not count.

He sometimes made $150,000 a year, headlining cards featuring the “bad guys” — Killer Kowalski, Hans Mortier, Waldo von Erich, Ivan Koloff, Gorilla Monsoon, Professor Toro Tanaka and George (the Animal) Steele. Feuds and insults fueled the publicity hype, and outrages in the ring sent crowds wild. Every wrestler had a gimmick: ethnicity or nationality, the personas of cowboys, lumberjacks or farmers, and sports reporters went along with the fun.

“Chief Big Heart, no cigar-store Indian, used his ‘tomahawk chop’ to advantage,” The New York Times related in 1965. “The referee warned the Chief, ‘Don’t use your foot.’

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

“What do you mean?” replied the Chief. “I’m only stepping on his head.”

Sammartino and many of his opponents were under contract to the wrestling federation, which arranged matches, orchestrated publicity and made millions from ticket sales and television broadcasts.

The money was good, but Sammartino said he was motivated by pride, not howling fans who admired his headlock on the Sheik of Araby or goaded him to kick and stomp Crybaby Cannon.

Sammartino was a “good guy,” but like all the others, he pounced, grimaced, grunted and rolled with the blows — a heroic Italian vs. a villainous Manchurian or a giant from Berlin: a different scenario for every match.

In February 1961, Sammartino body-slammed Chick Garibaldi to the canvas at Sunnyside Gardens in Queens. Garibaldi did not get up. The referee stopped the match and determined that Garibaldi was dead. A medical examiner later said he had suffered a heart attack. Sammartino was stricken with remorse for months.

Sammartino himself almost died, of a broken neck, when Stan Hansen, in a match in New York in 1976, dropped him on his head. Sammartino spent weeks in a hospital.

Sammartino did not dispute that professional wrestling matches were fixed. But he bristled at suggestions that he had ever taken a fall and said his injuries were proofs of his honesty.

“I would be a fool to tell you that there was no fixing,” he told The Washington Post in 1980 as his career wound down. “You ask if wrestling is for real? Well, I think my own body answers that question. I have broken more bones than any of the others — my neck, my collarbone, both arms, wrists, knuckles, all of my ribs, my back. A hairline fracture of the kneecap. My jaw has been wired and rewired. It’s incredible to think people would fake that.”

In 1989, Vincent K. McMahon, the owner of WWE, acknowledged for the first time that its matches were not contests, only entertainment shows featuring story lines, scripts and sometimes dangerous choreography. The admission was made to avoid taxes and licensing fees imposed by state athletic commissions.

Bruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino was born on Oct. 6, 1935, in central Italy, in the town of Pizzoferrato. He was the youngest of seven children of Alfonso and Emilia Sammartino. Four siblings did not survive childhood.

After the father left for America in 1939, the remaining family fled invading German forces during World War II and hid in the mountains of Abruzzo for 14 months, subsisting on little food. After the war, they immigrated to the United States and were reunited with the father in Pittsburgh.

Bruno, a sickly 90-pounder who spoke little English, was a target of bullies at Schenley High School and resolved to build his physique with weight lifting and wrestling. He weighed 225 at graduation in 1953.

He went on to work out with the University of Pittsburgh wrestling coach, Rex Peery, competed in locally televised amateur matches, and narrowly lost a spot on the 1956 Olympic weight-lifting team to Paul Anderson, who won the heavyweight gold medal in Melbourne, Australia.

Sammartino married Carol Teyssier in 1959 and had three children with her: David and the twins Daniel and Darryl. All survive him. David Sammartino, a former professional wrestler, had briefly lured his father out of retirement to form a tag team.

In 1959, Sammartino signed a $250-a-week contract with Capitol Pro Wrestling, owned by Mr. McMahon and Joseph Mondt, and wrestled in Pennsylvania, New York and other states. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Mondt later formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation and awarded its heavyweight title to “Nature Boy” Buddy Rogers in April 1963.

A month later, Sammartino faced Rogers at Madison Square Garden for the title. Rogers was supposed to win. But in a story often told in wrestling circles, Sammartino broke the bad news to him in the ring.

“We can do this the easy way, or the hard way,” Sammartino said. He pinned Rogers in 48 seconds, launching his championship career.

After his second reign ended in 1977, he wrestled on tours. He retired in 1981 from full-time professional wrestling, although he later appeared in exhibition matches. In 2013, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. He had declined induction several times, dissatisfied with what he called lurid story lines, over-the-top theatrics and drug and steroid abuse by professional wrestlers.

As he explained in “Bruno Sammartino: An Autobiography of Wrestling’s Living Legend” (1990, with Bob Michelucci and Paul McCollough): “If the general public knew how much of this was going on today in wrestling by some of these so-called heroes that the children are rooting for, they would be shocked and devastated by it all.”The first season was full of ideas about consciousness, exploitation (especially of women, or robo-women) and the seductiveness of gory entertainments. But without fully drawn characters to embody them, they remained only ideas — art as algorithm.

The hosts began as literal characters in a narrative, their personalities malleable, their memories erasable. This made for tour-de-force, turn-on-a-dime performances from Ms. Wood as Dolores, programmed as a starry-eyed rancher’s daughter, and Thandie Newton as Maeve, a brothel’s savvy madam.

But it was hard to truly invest in them when what we knew as “them” could be changed with a few tweaks of their software. The new season gives them an upgrade — free will — which provides their stories actual stakes and elevates them from mere victims.

I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords. Dolores has become radicalized, roaming the badlands to liberate her “people,” and Ms. Wood makes as commanding a zealot as she did a naïf.

Maeve, meanwhile, is seeking her lost daughter, dragging along Lee (Simon Quarterman), the park’s cynical head writer, as a hostage. Ms. Newton plays her with dry wit and swagger, like a Bond girl transformed into James Bond. When Maeve gives Lee an anatomically graphic threat, he can’t help pointing out that he wrote the line. “A bit broad, if you ask me,” she says.

Another host, Bernard (Jeffrey Wright), a Westworld scientist who until recently believed himself human, has a more subdued role, accompanying a security force from Delos (the park’s shadowy parent corporation) on a mission that relates to the company’s real ambitions for its A.I. technology.

All these peregrinations reveal new areas of the vast park. One, based on Edo-period Japan, has already been previewed, but suffice it to say that the blood and dominance fantasies of the guests vary little by either geography or historical era. This monotonously bleak outlook made the real-human characters of “Westworld” its most dull, from the boorish park visitors to the corporate villains.

That hasn’t changed, especially as regards the tedious, spattery quest of the Man in Black (Ed Harris in the present, Jimmi Simpson in flashbacks). Delos’s majority owner and Westworld’s most inveterate gamer, he continues to travel the park in search of — I don’t know, something something mankind’s brutal nature.

Don’t expect too much improvement too fast from “Westworld” 2.0. It’s still overly focused on balletic blood baths and narrative fake-outs, and much of the dialogue still sounds as if it were written as a tagline for a subway poster, like Dolores’s “I have one last role to play: myself.”

But “Westworld” remains a glorious production to look at, and there are stretches where it feels invigorated by its new, expanded world — freer to breathe, relax, invent. It’s 50 percent better when it takes itself 25 percent less seriously.

This pays off, for instance, in an episode where a band of escaped hosts, journeying into a different park, becomes invested in the “narrative” of another host group — even though it resembles one they themselves played out, over and over. They know it’s a show, but they can’t help but be transported anyway. Isn’t that what being human is?Photo

‘We Have to Talk About It’

James Comey sat down with Stephen Colbert on Tuesday and described the shock of being summarily fired from his position as F.B.I. director nearly a year ago. He also explained why he decided to write a book criticizing President Trump. Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty,” hit stores on Tuesday.

Comey admitted to Colbert that he had been surprised by his firing, given that he was leading an investigation that had to do with the Trump campaign’s own dealings with Russia.

COMEY: I actually was quite surprised, because I thought, ‘I’m leading the Russia investigation.’ Even though our relationship was becoming strained, there’s no way I’m going to get fired or whacked. COLBERT: Why? Why wouldn’t you get fired? COMEY: Because that would be a crazy thing to do. Why would you fire the F.B.I. director who is leading the Russia investigation? COLBERT: Because you’re leading the Russia investigation! I don’t know if you’ve dealt with mob bosses before, but they don’t like to be investigated.

In recent days Trump has been furiously tweeting about Comey, even suggesting he should be put in jail. Comey told Colbert that the episode seemed to reflect the reasons he decided to write “A Higher Loyalty”: to remind the country that it should not take the president’s public acts too lightly.

“My first reaction to those kinds of tweets is a shrug — like, ‘Oh, there he goes again.’ But actually then I caught myself and I said, ‘Wait a minute. If I’m shrugging, are the rest of the country shrugging? And does that mean we’ve become numb to this?’ It’s not O.K. for the president of the United States to say a private citizen should be in jail. It’s not normal, it’s not acceptable, it’s not O.K. But it’s happened so much, there’s a danger we’re now numb to it, and the norm has been destroyed. And I feel that norm destroying in my own shrug. So we can’t allow that to happen. We have to talk about it and call it out. It’s not O.K.” — JAMES COMEY

Tax Humor

Tuesday was Tax Day, and it was even more hectic than usual: The I.R.S. website malfunctioned for much of the day. Jimmy Fallon and James Corden made a few tax-related quips based on other news items.

“In honor of Tax Day, Hardee’s offered free breakfast biscuits if you said the password ‘made from scratch.’ Arby’s had a similar deal: They gave you a free roast beef sandwich with the password ‘made from squirrel.’” — JIMMY FALLON “It’s Tax Day. Of course Stormy Daniels did her taxes. I thought this was interesting: She listed her hush money from Donald Trump under ‘gross income.’” — JIMMY FALLON “Some great news for Donald Trump, though: Between the constant firings in the White House, the porn-star scandal and the Russia investigation, he was able to write off this entire year as a total loss.” — JAMES CORDEN “The I.R.S. says they expect to receive 17 million tax returns this week. And get this: They think that one or even two of them may be filled out correctly.” — JAMES CORDEN

The Punchiest Punchlines (Abstinence Edition)

“The president is said to be furious about this book, because it combines the two things he hates most: criticism and reading.” — JIMMY KIMMEL, on “A Higher Loyalty” “I heard about an official in Japan who was arrested yesterday for taking out his garbage in the nude. Wow, when that guy takes out his junk he really takes out all of his junk.” — JIMMY FALLON “It was reported today that President Trump has been pushing for women’s health programs that are based on abstinence. Yeah, Trump said, ‘It was actually my wife’s idea.’” — CONAN O’BRIEN

Each year the Tribeca Film Festival brings a crippling array of choices for attendees. Here are the films — new and old — that the festival’s co-founder Robert De Niro would see if he were you, complete with commentary.It was nominated for 31 Emmys and won seven. John Larroquette, Markie Post, Richard Moll, Charles Robinson and Marsha Warfield starred alongside Mr. Anderson.

Judge Harry Stone shared more than a first name with the actor who played him: Both the character and the man wore colorful ties, were magicians at heart and were superfans of the singer Mel Tormé, who made several guest appearances on “Night Court.” Mr. Anderson delivered a eulogy at Mr. Tormé’s funeral in 1999.

While he earned critical acclaim and amassed a devoted fan base on “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson never fancied himself an actor. “I’m a magician, or a performer, by nature, and that’s always what I’ve been,” he told WGN-TV in Chicago in 2014.

“I was never really an actor,” he said. “I was a magician who fell into a part on ‘Cheers.’ ”

His role as the swindler Harry (the Hat) Gittes on “Cheers” — he appeared in six episodes, four in the show’s first two seasons — led to his break on “Night Court” after he impressed Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC.

Mr. Anderson’s “Cheers” character echoed his real life as well. In 1985, he told People magazine that he used to run a classic street hustle, the shell game, in San Francisco, where, at 21, he had his jaw broken by an opponent who was livid at the game’s outcome.

Mr. Anderson, one of three children, was born on Oct. 14, 1952, in Newport, R.I., and spent much of his childhood on the move, often performing on the streets for money, he told People. He had lived in many cities, including Chicago, New York, St. Louis and New Orleans, by the time he landed in California at age 16. From there he found success as a comic magician, which opened the door to his acting career.

About his mother, he said to People: “She was a hustler, yeah. She did a lot of things. We moved around a lot, and she had a lot of men friends.”

But he said his childhood was not bad, adding that his dubious background should not be viewed any differently from his mother’s.

“I respect my mother; she was very concerned with taking care of us,” he said. “She did what needed to be done to try to keep us together. People find my criminal days amusing, but they find her background shocking. I don’t draw any line.”

Mr. Anderson told People that his father was a salesman who was mostly absent from his life, and that he had not seen him for 15 years before his death.

Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Morgan, and two children from his first marriage, to Leslie Pollack: Eva Fay Anderson, a writer and producer in Los Angeles; and Dashiell Anderson, a teacher.

In his late teens and early 20s, Mr. Anderson traveled the country performing magic. During a stint in Austin, Tex., about 45 years ago, he was performing on the street when he met someone else entertaining passers-by: a juggler named Turk Pipkin.

The chance encounter led to a lifelong friendship and business partnership. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pipkin performed together across the United States, and when Mr. Anderson decided he wanted to try acting in Hollywood, Mr. Pipkin followed him.

“We were making it up as we went along,” Mr. Pipkin said in an interview on Tuesday. “When he gathered a crowd, people were just mesmerized. People just couldn’t look away.”

Mr. Anderson appeared on “Saturday Night Live” several times in the 1980s. He hosted the show at the height of his fame, in 1985.

After “Night Court,” Mr. Anderson felt burned out, so he moved with his first wife and their children to Washington State. But CBS lured him back into television a few years later with an offer to play the newspaper columnist Dave Barry on the comedy “Dave’s World,” which ran from 1993 to 1997.

In 2008, he appeared in an episode of “30 Rock” titled “The One With the Cast of ‘Night Court.’ ”

In 2000 Mr. Anderson moved to New Orleans, eager to return to his roots. It was there that Mr. Pipkin introduced him to Ms. Morgan. Once married, the Andersons opened the nightclub Oswald’s Speakeasy, where he performed, as well as a magic and curiosity shop, Sideshow.

Mr. Anderson at first refused to leave New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, opting to stay in Oswald’s in the French Quarter while the storm battered the city, Mr. Pipkin said. He evacuated only when the firefighters stationed nearby said they were leaving.

After Katrina, tourism flagged. Mr. Anderson disagreed with the city’s plans for rebuilding, Mr. Pipkin said.

He and his wife had also become captive to the depression that affected many in New Orleans at the time, Mr. Anderson told The New York Times in 2006. Despite efforts to support their community — Mr. Anderson opened his club for what he called French Quarter Town Hall meetings — and maintain their businesses, they chose to call it quits.

The Andersons took a weeklong vacation in Asheville, where they fell in love with an old house and decided to buy it.

“I’m glad we tried to stay” in New Orleans, Mr. Anderson said, “but I don’t want to be the person I will be if I stay here.”Because they also wanted to include a large and varying group of people in the study, they turned to the trove of data gathered in Britain in the U.K. Biobank, which houses health information about more than 500,000 men and women who were between ages 40 and 69 at the study’s start in 2006.

All of the participants had provided blood and saliva samples for genetic testing, filled out extensive questionnaires about their exercise and other health habits, and in some cases, sweated on a stationary bike or treadmill and later squeezed a vice-like gadget to quantify their aerobic fitness and muscular strength. Some also wore activity monitors for a week to objectively track how much they moved.

The researchers zeroed in on the 482,702 men and women in the study who had had no known heart disease at the start, genetically typing their tissue samples, looking for various snippets of genes known to raise heart disease risk. They also stratified them into three groups, based on how fit and strong they were.

Then they checked to see whether any of the men and women developed heart disease within the next six years or so. Many did, according to their health records, especially if they carried any of the gene variants associated with cardiac conditions.

But physical fitness changed that calculus significantly, the data showed.

Those men and women with the highest aerobic fitness halved their statistical likelihood of developing heart disease, no matter how worrisome their genetic profiles, the scientists found.

In essence, if people were fit, they were less likely to have heart problems than someone who was less fit, even if their genes predicted heart disease.

Stout grip strength likewise reduced cardiac-disease risk, although not quite to the same extent.

“What this tells us is that you can mitigate some of your genetic risk for heart disease by being fit, no matter how high that risk may be,” says Dr. Erik Ingelsson, a professor of medicine at Stanford who oversaw the study.All told, the national park, which was created in 1926, partly from farmland bequeathed by Cecil John Rhodes, the founder of the British South African Company, which colonized Rhodesia, has more than 400 varieties of birds, ranging from southern ground hornbills to black storks to mocking cliff chats. In recent decades, thanks to the efforts of Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority — one of the few functioning institutions in this country — the park has also become a sanctuary for leopards, antelopes and a robust population of white and black rhinos.

But it was the birds of prey that I had mainly come to see. Over the past six months I have been researching a book that deals in part with Jeffrey Lendrum, described by British police as one of the world’s most prolific wildlife thieves and smugglers.

Raised in Bulawayo in the 1970s, at the height of the Rhodesian bush war that brought the guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe to power, Mr. Lendrum began climbing into Matobo’s hard-to-reach nests as a boy. He would later turn his agility and ornithological expertise to controversial ends, roaming from Tierra del Fuego to northern Quebec, and snatching the live eggs of wild falcons — reportedly on behalf of wealthy Arab falconry enthusiasts. (Mr. Lendrum was convicted of stealing eggs in Britain in 2010 and in Chile in 2015, and served time in prison, but insists he did it to save falcons that would otherwise have perished in the wild.)

In the course of my reporting I have begun tracing Mr. Lendrum’s footsteps around the world, viewing the aeries of peregrines in the Rhondda Valley in Wales, and flying with a falcon in a hot-air balloon in Dubai. Now I had come to southern Africa see where his journey had begun.

Mr. Brebner and his wife, Jen, another bird enthusiast, picked me up at my guest cottage in Bulawayo in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, and we headed down a two-lane tarmac road toward Matobo. It was just two weeks after the military coup that had unseated Mr. Mugabe after 37 years in power. “The roadblocks are gone now,” Mr. Brebner said, referring to the ubiquitous checkpoints that had appeared in the last two years of Mr. Mugabe ’s rule. Desperate police officers, he explained, had extorted cash from drivers to replace their unpaid salaries.Travelers can reserve an Insidr phone online and pick it up at Paris Orly Airport or Charles de Gaulle Airport, or have it mailed to them anywhere in the city. The company was founded by Ben and Nina Forlani, a brother and sister team and Parisian natives. “We didn’t want tourists to Paris to feel like they weren’t getting an authentic perspective of the city because they didn’t know French,” Mr. Forlani said. Rental prices start at five euros a day, and Insidr concierges speak English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Spanish, Russian and Portuguese.

A Local Fixer, in Your Pocket

The City Helpline, a mobile app for Apple iPhones and devices running Google’s Android operating system, gives travelers access to a concierge, either via live messaging or by phone, who can help them with a variety of requests. The concierge, for example, can help them find the right bus and bus stop that will take them to the Louvre, recommend a guide who can give them a street art tour, connect them with a an English speaking babysitter and even share a list of restaurants that serve dishes suited to their gluten-free diet. Plus, they can also assist in emergencies such as if a traveler gets sick and needs to see a doctor.

Right now, the concierge service is available Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time, but the company has plans to have 24-hour service before the end of the year. A subscription to use the app costs five euros a day. Concierges speak English, Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian.

A Translator at the Theater

Theatre in Paris translates French theater performances into English in 10 playhouses in Paris, including Theatre Mogador, currently showing French productions of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and the musical “Grease,” and Theatre de Ranelagh, currently showing the play “Ruy Blas” by Victor Hugo, “Cyrano de Bergerac” and more. The company placed a projection screen above the stages in these theaters that displays an English translation of the words being spoken on the stage.

Those who buy a ticket through Theatre in Paris are assigned seats that will give them the best vantage point of both the stage and the screen; they’re also met at the theater by a company employee who gives them a program in English. Tickets start at about 25 euros. Carl de Poncins, the app’s founder, said that he came up with the idea for the projection screens because he had an Australian roommate who loved theater but knew little French. “He never used to go to performances because he couldn’t understand what was going on,” he said. “Why should language get in the way of seeing the incredible theater Paris has?”But that rightward tug has more to do with gerrymandering and cynical pols than with demographics. The state is becoming more urban and less white. “It should be as reliably blue as California,” Wright says. “Instead, it is the Red Planet in the political universe.”

Wright rattles off the familiar stereotypes: “cowboy individualism, a kind of wary friendliness, superpatriotism combined with defiance of all government authority, a hair-trigger sense of grievance, nostalgia for an ersatz past that is largely an artifact of Hollywood.” He concedes they’re all true. But they’re not all there is. “God Save Texas” also depicts “a culture that is still raw, not fully formed, standing on the margins but also growing in influence, dangerous and magnificent in its potential.”

The book rambles far and wide, and it’s a testament to Wright’s formidable storytelling skills that a reader will encounter plenty of information without ever feeling lost. A bride and groom emerging from a chapel leads to a disquisition on the Spanish conquistadors and the explorer Cabeza de Vaca; a chapter on Texas radio turns into a discussion of Texas gun laws and a consideration of Texas snakes.

“It sometimes seems that every living thing can bite or poke or sting or shoot you,” Wright says of the state where he lives. He has a deep knowledge of the terrain; he has been hoarding details over a lifetime, consulting history books, his reporter’s notes, his own memories and what one imagines is a massive clippings file of truly strange stuff.

Politicians offer up much by way of raw, often confounding, material. Sometimes all Wright has to do is relay the facts, arranged just so, and the hypocrisies come shining through. Describing the Republicans’ obsession with their failed “bathroom bill,” which would have forced transgender people to use the restroom that corresponded with the sex on their birth certificates, his deadpan delivery cuts deep: “Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is under indictment for securities fraud, added, ‘This is a spiritual war.’”

Other details showcase what Wright calls the “burlesque side” to Texas politics, which sometimes finds its way to the national stage. Wright recalls the 2016 video of Sen. Ted Cruz wrapping a strip of bacon around the barrel of an AR-15, pulling the trigger, peeling the bacon off the smoking gun and eating it with a plastic fork. “The object of the video apparently was to show a jollier and more human side of the candidate,” he writes, knowing he doesn’t have to say more than that; the senator, the bacon and the gun have done all the work.

But the book isn’t only about current affairs, and Wright — who was born in Oklahoma and moved to Abilene, Tex., as a child in the 1950s — weaves in his own intimate history with the state. He fled Texas after high school, doing “everything I could to cleanse myself of its influence.”

That influence included its long shadow of racism. In 1845, the bankrupt Texas Republic chose to be annexed by the United States as a slave state; the alternative was a bailout from the British, which would have preserved Texas’s independence but required it to switch to a system of non-slave wage labor. Texas, at this crossroad and others, chose slavery every time.

Wright has ancestors who fought for the Confederacy. In Abilene, he kept a portrait of General Robert E. Lee on his bedroom wall. He would later cover the civil rights movement for The Race Relations Reporter in Nashville. “I still feel ashamed of the prejudices that I struggled to shed,” he writes. He doesn’t say much here about that struggle, though in his 1987 memoir, “In the New World,” he explores his Texas upbringing with vulnerability and candor.

Since returning to Texas in 1980, Wright has lived in Austin, the state capital that serves as a scapegoat for state lawmakers, who routinely attack the city in showy attempts to establish their conservative bona fides. They’re almost as fixated on Austin as they are on California. To them, as Wright puts it, “Austin is a spore of the California fungus that is destroying America.”

Wright doesn’t counter the moral panic with moral panic. His tone is gentle, occasionally chiding, and he seems most comfortable in the center lane, allowing the road hogs to pass by while he holds steady at the wheel.

Certain readers might crave more righteous anger from someone writing about Texas, especially now, when there’s little room for agreement and plenty at stake. But Wright’s project is perspective, not conquest. In a chapter on Texas culture, he praises the work of contemporary artists who have returned to their Texas roots “with knowledge, self-confidence, and occasionally, forgiveness.” “God Save Texas” is his vivid bid to do the same.As she drank she experienced the alcohol as abating unhappy emotions only to discover, again and again, that it was secretly abetting them. She sought out sex with strangers as “a way of purging feeling, siphoning it off and putting it somewhere else.” But drinking, she saw, was “a shape-shifter. It sheds its various costumes of pleasure and exposes itself as an attempt to flee the same sadness it always ends up deepening instead.”

Finally, she decides to go to an A.A. meeting in Iowa City. She fears that recovery will be boring: not merely that it will be a tedious experience to undergo, but that being in recovery will transform her into a dull person. In a touching, comic scene, her anxiety is fulfilled when, the first time she tells her story at a meeting, a crazy old man shouts at her that she is boring. It was as if, she writes, “I’d somehow failed at my dysfunction, failed to make it bad or bold or interesting enough; that recovery had flatlined my story past narrative repair.”

The intellectual project of the book, as she sets it out, is to create a narrative about recovery that is as powerful as the fictional representations of alcoholism in literature. “If addiction stories run on the fuel of darkness … then recovery is often seen as the narrative slack, the dull terrain of wellness,” she writes. She reads a how-to-write-a-recovery-memoir guide and (surprise, surprise) finds it clichéd and formulaic. She fixates on the story of Charles Jackson, the alcoholic author of the best-selling 1944 novel “The Lost Weekend,” who became sober, but developed writer’s block, and was never able to publish the big book he planned to write about recovery. She even searches out the manuscript in his archives and confirms that it is, indeed, lifeless, which she takes as confirmation of her fears about sobriety. She describes herself as driven by the need “to know if stories about getting better could ever be as compelling as stories about falling apart.” She “needed to believe they could.”

Believe! It’s hard to know what to make of all this. Drawing on her Ph.D. thesis on writers and sobriety, she entwines her own story with fascinating, smartly chosen biographical sketches and quotations from famous alcoholic writers and their critics. She quotes, for example, a fawning 1967 Life magazine profile of Berryman, “Whiskey and Ink, Whiskey and Ink,” which asserted that Berryman needed both “to survive and describe” his acute sense of mortality. But that was 1967. The myth of the alcoholic writer seems decades out of date. (Indeed, it’s hard to think of a single prominent writer glorified for alcoholism today.)

What has replaced it has been an enormous flowering of recovery memoirs in the last few decades, which Jamison summarily dismisses. It’s unfortunate when writers believe they need to create a whole new genre in order for their work to be of value. Jamison’s book fits well into this rich body of recovery memoirs and her book would be strengthened by being situated among them, just as it is strengthened by the portraits of the famous fiction writers and poets she has included. Instead, as she continues her quest, she presents herself as discovering successful fiction dealing with recovery by Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson and David Foster Wallace, while holding on to the fantasy that she alone must invent a memoir that transcends “the tedious architecture and tawdry self-congratulation of a redemption story.” At one point, she describes picking up Caroline Knapp’s beloved memoir, “Drinking: A Love Story,” in a bookstore, but never tells us what she thinks of it! If she doesn’t feel that book (or Lee Springer’s “Grand Central Winter,” which she also mentions) answers the question of whether a recovery memoir can be riveting, why not move on to work by, say, Mary Karr, David Carr, Susan Cheever, Jerry Stahl, Bill Clegg, or a dozen others?

Addiction is a handy tool in fiction because it causes characters to behave in dramatically destructive ways. And fictional characters don’t need to sober up because fiction does not require redemption — they can just perish. But there are no good memoirs about being a drunk and staying a drunk. Memoirs about addiction are always recovery stories — and, fortunately, recovery is a great subject. If addiction is an attempt to medicate bad feeling, recovery forces the writer to experience it straight, like everyone else.

In fact, for all the “this was living” justification of her drinking life, Jamison’s book actually becomes more alive and more interesting in the second half, when she starts wrestling with her demons sober, which is to say really wrestling.

Jamison’s prose is strikingly uneven. The writing itself seems tipsy: It can be energetic, colorful, fun, buzzy, affecting and spot on, but also loose, sloppy, digressive and excessively poetized at moments, veering into nebulous grandiosity. In “The Empathy Exams,” Jamison’s acclaimed book of essays, her writing benefited from the tighter form of the essay, whereas in this book, like a drunk spinning a colorful yarn at a party, she sometimes loses track of her audience and what we need to know. Her tale is bloated with detail about what she and various boyfriends did together too, while far too little is said about more central questions such as the curious lack of attempts at intervention by those boyfriends, not to mention her accomplished parents and her brothers. Perhaps she wants to preserve her family’s privacy, but, of course, the need for privacy is at odds with the needs of a memoir.

The redeeming grace of the book is Jamison’s honesty. She shared at an A.A. meeting that before she gets out of the car, she makes sure to turn the radio from the pop station she was enjoying to NPR in order to impress her boyfriend, and a woman in the meeting laughed and warmed up to her — and so will readers. Just when her self-indulgence becomes wearying, she cuts through it with a critique of her own self-absorption. She chooses to share many unflattering moments, both large and small. There was the time, for example, when she was living with her dying grandmother in order to take care of her, but instead she spent her nights holed upstairs in her room drinking wine she pinched from the hotel where she worked and her mornings trying to write her novel about alcoholism through a hangover. (In fact, her sense of moral failing was so keen that she was driven to ease her guilt with more booze.)

Emotional, as well as factual, honesty is the sine qua non of a memoir. Yet this kind of deep honesty — the merciless self-examination and exposure that Jamison displays — is increasingly rare in memoirs now that readers can, and will, attack them online. And many memoirists no longer feel the literary necessity of self-scrutiny, as the advertisements-for-myself-style writing on social media has been culturally validated.

The book is at its least successful when Jamison diverges from alcoholism to the larger social issue of criminalization of drug addiction, including the persecution of pregnant drug abusers and the targeting of minorities in the war on drugs. She trots out familiar arguments (that addicts should be suffering from a disease, not criminals) that may be true, but fail to advance the conversation. Attempts to link those arguments to her story seem more than a little strained. She writes about the infamous case of Marcia Powell — a mentally ill prostitute and crystal meth addict who died of heat exposure in 2009 in an outdoor holding cell in the Arizona desert. “My story included the woman who died in a cage in a desert, or her story included me; not just because of my guilt — the guilt of my privilege, or my survival — but because we both put things inside our bodies to change how we felt,” she writes.

The analogy seems like such a stretch that it belies the truth of each of their experiences. Jamison writes that while society would prefer to view the two women separately, she rejects that narrative — an assertion that seems like a clumsy attempt to ward off potential (unfair) criticism that her social privilege makes her own suffering an unworthy topic. Likewise, at the close of the book, she writes of the recovering alcoholics she met in A.A.: “In Iowa, in Kentucky, in Wyoming. In Los Angeles, in Boston, in Portland. I could say I wrote this book for all of them — for all of us — or I could say they wrote this book for me.” Identification rendered that broadly — the fantasy that the similarity between her and other addicts is so great that those strangers could actually have written her memoir — feels fulsome and so simplistic as to be almost silly.

The book is dedicated to “anyone addiction has touched.” Such readers will doubtless relate to her story and be grateful for her honesty and insight. But what about readers who do not have a personal interest in the subject? Jamison’s book falls into that vast category of good books that tantalize the reader with all the ways in which they could have been better.For nearly 20 years, Williams worked as a contractor, building houses in Kansas City. But work dried up after the financial crisis hit in 2007. Williams decided to return to the family farm near Waverly, an area of gently rolling plains, and give farming a try. His family had farmed some when he was a teenager before leasing the land to tenants for years, and he knew it was difficult to make ends meet. But he was inspired by an article about a North Dakota rancher and farmer named Gabe Brown, who claimed to have developed, through trial and error, a more efficient and cost-effective way to farm.

The gist of Brown’s argument was that if you focus on the health of the soil and not on yield, eventually you come out ahead, not necessarily because you grow more corn or wheat per acre but because the reduction in spending on fertilizer and other inputs lets you produce each bushel of grain more cheaply. Williams decided to follow Brown’s prescription. “If after three years, I’m bankrupt, I’ll admit it was a bad joke,” Williams remembers thinking.

Seven years later, his gamble seems to have paid off. He started with 60 acres, now farms about 2,000 and, when I visited last fall, had just purchased an additional 200. In one of his fields, we walked down a lane he had mowed through his warm-weather cover crops — plants grown not to be harvested, but to enrich the soil — which towered over us, reaching perhaps eight feet. They included sorghum, a canelike grass with red-tinted tassels spilling from the tops, mung beans and green-topped daikon radishes low to the ground. Each plant was meant to benefit the earth in a different way. The long radishes broke it up and drew nutrients toward the surface; tall grasses like sorghum produced numerous fine rootlets, adding organic material to the land; legumes harbored bacteria that put nitrogen into the soil. His 120-strong herd of British white cattle — he introduced livestock in 2013 — would eventually eat through the field, turning the plants into cow patties and enriching the soil further. Then he would plant his cash crops. “Had I not found this way to farm,” he told me, “we would not be farming.”

A mat of dead vegetation — from cover crops, cash-crop residue and dung — covered Williams’s fields. The mulch, along with his cover crops, inhibited weeds from becoming established, a major concern for conventional farmers, because so many weeds have evolved resistance to herbicides. “I don’t lie awake at night wondering how I’m going to kill weeds,” Williams said.

Williams doesn’t till his fields. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming prevents erosion, helps retain moisture and leaves the soil ecosystem — worms, fungi, roots and more — mostly intact. At one of his soybean fields, Williams showed me how this translated to soil with “structure.” “See how that crumbles into a cottage-cheese look?” he said, massaging a fistful of earth. Small clods fell through his fingers. “That’s what you want.” Worm holes riddled the dirt, giving it a spongelike quality that was critical, he said, for absorbing rain and preventing runoff. Weather patterns seemed to be changing, he noted. Rain used to arrive in numerous light storms. Now fewer storms came, but they were more intense. “We have to be able to capture rain and store it,” he said.

By focusing on soil health, Williams says he has reduced his use of herbicides by 75 percent and fertilizers by 45 percent. He doesn’t use pesticides — he relies instead on beneficial insects for pest control — and he saves money by not buying expensive genetically modified, herbicide-resistant seed. He estimates that he produces a bushel of soybeans for about 20 percent less than his conventionally farming neighbors. Last fall, he claims, his yields ranked among the highest in the county. While doing all this, he has so far raised the amount of soil organic matter, a rough predictor of soil carbon concentrations, from around 2 percent to 3.5 percent in some fields. Gabe Brown, for his part, says he has more than tripled his soil carbon since the 1990s. And an official with the U.S.D.A.’s Agricultural Research Service confirmed to me that the amount of carbon in Brown’s soil — what his farming has pulled from the atmosphere — was between two and three times as high as it was in his neighbors’ land.

The successes of Brown and Williams suggest that farmers can increase carbon in the soil while actually reducing their overall expenses. This could be vital, because in order for carbon farming to have an impact on the climate, as much land as possible, including both crop- and rangeland, will have to be included in the effort.

Critics of regenerative agriculture say that it can’t be adopted broadly and intensively enough to matter — or that if it can, the prices of commodities might be affected unfavorably. Mark Bradford, a professor of soils and ecosystem ecology at Yale, questions what he sees as a quasi-religious belief in the benefits of soil carbon. The recommendation makes sense intuitively, he told me. But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn’t been quantified, making it somewhat “faith-based.”

William Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that “regenerative” practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven’t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. He thinks the climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold.

Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger’s broader point — about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases — is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren’t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example. What they do demonstrate is that augmenting soil carbon while farming is not only possible, but also beneficial, even in a business sense. And that makes the prospect of rolling out these practices on a larger scale much easier to imagine.

The carbon-farming idea is gathering momentum at a time when national climate policy is backsliding. The Trump administration has reversed various Obama-era regulations meant to combat or adapt to climate change, including the Clean Power Plan, which required power plants to reduce their carbon emissions, and a rule instructing the federal government to consider sea-level rise and other effects of a changing climate when building new roads, bridges and other infrastructure.

In the absence of federal leadership on climate — and as emissions continue to rise globally, shrinking the time available to forestall worst-case outcomes — state and local governments (as well as nonprofits) have begun to look into carbon farming. Last year, Hawaii passed legislation meant to keep it aligned with the Paris agreement, which President Trump has said he will abandon; the state has also created a task force to research carbon farming. The New York state assemblywoman Didi Barrett introduced legislation that would make tax credits available to farmers who increase soil carbon, presumably through methods like those employed by Darin Williams and Gabe Brown. A bill to educate farmers about soil has been proposed in Massachusetts. And in Maryland, legislation focused on soil health passed in 2017. Other carbon-farming projects are in the works in Colorado, Arizona and Montana.

But it is California, already in the vanguard on climate-mitigation efforts, that has led the way on carbon farming. By 2050, the state aims to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 20 percent of what they were in 1990. Nearly half its 58 counties have farmers and ranchers at various stages of developing and implementing carbon-farming plans. San Francisco, which already has the largest urban composting program in the country, hopes to become a model carbon-farming metropolis. Cities don’t have much room to plant trees or undertake other practices that remove carbon from the atmosphere, says Deborah Raphael, the director of San Francisco’s Department of the Environment. But they can certainly produce plenty of compost. “If we can show other cities how doable it is to get green waste out of landfills, we can prove the concept,” Raphael told me. “We like to say that San Francisco rehearses the future.”

Many of California’s carbon-farming efforts owe a debt to Wick, Creque and Silver. In 2008, they founded the Marin Carbon Project, a consortium of ranchers, scientists and land managers. The goal is to develop science-based carbon-farming practices and to help establish the incentives needed to encourage California farmers to adopt them. Silver continues to publish her findings in respected journals. Creque also started a nonprofit, the Carbon Cycle Institute, that assists farmers and ranchers in making carbon-farming plans.

Wick has thrown himself into the policy realm, hiring a lobbyist in Sacramento to push a carbon-farming agenda. (In 2014, he even testified before Congress, outlining the project’s discoveries and explaining how compost could increase soil carbon on public lands. He deliberately mentioned “climate” only once.) Educating policymakers matters because, as Torri Estrada, executive director of the Carbon Cycle Institute, points out, carbon-mitigation efforts that focus on agriculture can be much cheaper per ton of carbon avoided than the flashier energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects that usually get most of the attention. The major obstacle to their implementation, he says, is that government officials don’t understand or know about them.

California’s Healthy Soils Initiative, which Wick helped shape, explicitly enlists agriculture in the fight against climate change. In principle, that means this carbon farmers can receive money from the state’s climate-mitigation funds not just for compost but also for 34 other soil-improving practices already approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. That’s important because the compost needed to cover just a few acres can cost thousands of dollars. Wick has also tried to tap federal funding. Once N.R.C.S. scientists vet Silver’s work, a compost amendment could become the service’s 35th recommendation. As a result, farm bill money, which farmers receive to subsidize food production, could help finance carbon farming done according to Wick’s protocol — not to fight climate change explicitly (which is now seen as politicized), but to bolster the health of soil (which isn’t).

As a carbon-farming tool, compost bears some notable advantages — namely, it works both preventively and correctively. Composting prevents emissions from the starter material — manure, food scraps — that, if allowed to decompose, might emit potent greenhouse gases. (About one-fifth of United States methane emissions comes from food and other organic material decomposing in dumps.) By enhancing plant growth, it also aids in removing carbon from the atmosphere, a corrective process. And because the carbon in nearly all organic material was originally pulled from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, compost that enters the soil represents the storage of carbon removed from the air earlier — the grass eaten by cows that became manure, or the trees that became wood chips — and at a different location. That, too, is corrective.

Calla Rose Ostrander, Wick’s right-hand person at the Marin Carbon Project, told me that the project’s greater goal is to completely reframe how we think about waste, to see it as more than a nuisance — to recognize it as a resource, a tool that can help us garden our way out of the climate problem. Before the modern era, farmers had no choice but to return human and animal waste to the fields. (Wick is looking into the possibility of composting human waste as well; the end product is called humanure.) In a sense, Wick and Ostrander seek to resurrect these ancient practices and, with the aid of modern science, to close the loop among livestock, plants, air and soil — and between cities and the agricultural land that feeds them.

What seems to most impress experts about the Marin Carbon Project is the quality of Silver’s research. Eric Toensmeier, the author of “The Carbon Farming Solution” and a lecturer at Yale, says that the project figured out a new way to increase carbon storage on the semiarid grasslands that cover so much of the world. Jason Weller, the former head of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, told me that “the level of science investment is out of the ordinary, or extraordinary, for a group that is really self-started.” Weller added that the agency’s scientists still needed to vet the research, which they are in the midst of doing. In late 2016 the agency oversaw the application of compost to different California regions — inland, Southern, Northern — to see if land in various conditions would, like Wick’s ranch, suck up atmospheric carbon.

But the group also has critics. “I’m very skeptical of their results and their claims,” William Horwath, a soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, told me. He wants to see Silver’s experiments replicated. This is the project’s major weakness: Its big idea is based almost entirely on extrapolation from a few acres in California. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether compost can cause land to become a carbon sponge in all climates and conditions, and for how long treated grassland will continue to take in and retain its carbon.

Cows, a flash point in any discussion about climate change, may also present problems. Ruminants burp methane, and while carbon farming does not require their presence, some argue that merely accepting them on the land undermines the goal of reaching a carbon-neutral or -negative future. Livestock emissions account for almost half the heat-trapping gases associated with agriculture, so an obvious way to reduce emissions is to decrease the number of cows on the planet. Instead of dumping compost on rangeland, says Ian Monroe, a lecturer on energy and climate at Stanford University, why not allow forests cleared for pasture to regrow, and change people’s eating habits so they include less meat?

Criticism is directed at compost too. The stuff requires energy to produce; huge machines are required to shred the material and keep it aerated. And it’s unclear if compost, like synthetic fertilizer, can cause nitrogen pollution when put on the land, or how much greenhouse gas composting itself generates. (As long as compost mounds are regularly aerated to prevent low-oxygen conditions, composting is thought to produce few emissions.)

Organic material from municipal sources can contain bits of plastic and glass, which no one wants on their fields. Manure might carry seeds of invasive plants. (Silver has seen no evidence of this.) Spreading compost on public rangeland could disrupt plant communities, squeezing out species adapted to conditions of scarcity. And in any carbon-farming scheme, who will monitor and verify that far-flung stretches of land are really absorbing and storing the carbon as they’re supposed to?

Horwath considers the amount of compost used in Silver’s research — about 10 times the usual application, he estimates — to be unrealistically high for practical use. “It seems an inordinately large amount to apply to any system,” he told me. And given what he sees as the many unknowns in Silver’s research, that compost would be put to better use on cropland where, he says, scientists know with greater certainty that it could improve water retention and the efficiency of fertilizer.

Then there’s the problem of supply. Demand for San Francisco’s compost, which mostly goes to vineyards in California’s wine country, already outstrips what’s available. But Wick thinks more starter material shouldn’t be hard to find: Americans throw out between 30 and 40 percent of all the food they buy, sending it to landfills where it rots and generates greenhouse gases. Silver has calculated that there’s enough organic waste material in California to treat one-quarter of its rangeland every few decades.

Still, given the energy requirements, the logistical headaches and the cost, skeptics question whether spreading compost across extensive portions of the world’s surface — including conflict zones in the Sahel or Central Asia — is really feasible. Even if it is, soils probably can’t soak up carbon indefinitely. If they have a saturation point, increases in carbon will eventually stop when that moment is reached. And because soil degradation can cause the release of whatever carbon it holds, treated lands would have to be well cared for in perpetuity.

On a cool autumn day at Wick and Rathmann’s ranch house, Wick fielded phone calls while I wandered around the cluttered, semicircular room that served as his office and meeting space. A whiteboard displayed scribbles from a presentation on the carbon cycle. Coils of warmly hued yarn hung from the doorways. They came via a local nonprofit dedicated to climate-friendly ranching practices called Fibershed. And draped over a chair was a T-shirt bearing what might as well have been Wick’s battle cry: “seq-C,” it read, punny shorthand for “sequester carbon.” Under that it read, “Doing it in the dirt.”

Down the road, he showed me a composting facility that Creque dreamed up initially. He and Wick hoped it would serve as a self-sustaining prototype. “Anything that has ever been alive can be composted,” he told me, surveying the 10-foot-tall piles of chicken droppings and feathers, horse bedding (manure and straw) and shredded trees. A tractor mixed woody refuse with animal waste — to get the composting process started requires the right mix of carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. (That’s why some backyard composters recommend urinating on the pile to kick things off: Urine is rich in nitrogen.)While filming it in 2002, Karp, then a pediatrician in Santa Monica with a growing reputation, had asked his patients to call him whenever their child was having a crying fit. He then drove across town to record the encounters — effectively making house calls for screaming babies. Montée, a documentary filmmaker, worked the camera. The result has a zany, homemade quality. Over and over again, Karp is seen swaddling, handling and shushing babies into submission while talking to the camera in a voice so hypnotic it could be trademarked. One exhausted-looking father praised Karp for turning his crying daughter “to Jell-O.” It wasn’t exactly revolutionary, but his method was built on fast, practical tips that, well, worked. So we clung to them, feeling a little sheepish to be following a parenting expert so literally.

Birndorf told Karp that a pediatrician had recently visited the center and suggested that babies not be put to sleep on nursing pillows or on bouncing chairs — a reversal of previous pediatric guidelines. The advice of parenting experts — many but not all of whom are doctors — kept changing, she complained. The contradictions she recounted, from conveying to women that motherhood is a natural state to instructing them on exactly how and where their babies should sleep, all while nullifying earlier recommendations, seemed to get at an inherent paradox at the heart of a profession whose stated goal is to empower parents. “Highlights from 100 years of expert solicitude confirm the dirty little secret of child rearing: Though parenting gurus preach the supreme importance of consistency, their own shifting wisdom is proof of its impossibility,” Ann Hulbert, the author of “Raising America” (2003), a sweeping history of child-rearing advice, wrote in this magazine.

Karp nodded at Birndorf sympathetically. That he is one of those gurus, peddling parenting products, didn’t seem to discomfit him. Whenever someone points out the hypocrisies of today’s parenting industry, which happens often enough, Karp doesn’t try to defend it, or himself. He commiserates, and it sounds genuine — the ambivalent doctor trying to help parents make sense of a chaotic world. That’s one reason many parents find his approach so reassuring. Unlike other parenting books, Karp’s doesn’t feel preachy or berating. His tips can be applied just as easily by fathers as by mothers, and his pragmatic advice and suggested baby schedules don’t feel like more than what they are: suggestions. But as I trailed him on his rounds, his suggestions invariably seemed to crescendo toward a pitch.

“Well,” he told Birndorf, “this is where they would use a SNOO.”

When explaining his philosophy of parenthood, Karp likes to quote his late mother: “Keep an open mind, but don’t let your brain fall out.” Karp grew up in Queens with two older sisters in a family he describes as Jewish but not Orthodox, Democratic but not political. His father was a building engineer and occasionally a door-to-door salesman; his mother was in charge of the business’s bookkeeping. As a child, Harvey was temperamental. At 12, he smashed a golf club into a painting his sister made. Later, he took up meditation. “It was right when the Beatles were doing it,” he said. This began for him a lifelong interest in Eastern and alternative practices even as he decided to enroll in medical school.

By his second year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, Karp knew that he wanted to care for children, whom he considered more “optimistic and resilient” than adults. He moved to Los Angeles for a residency at Children’s Hospital, meeting and marrying a woman who was studying to become a family counselor. At night, he pored over his wife’s textbooks about family dynamics. He trained under Barbara Korsch, a pediatrician who was among the first to study the field of doctor-patient communication and to call for “reducing the power gap” between physicians and parents. “Being smart is important, but you can’t get through the door by being an arrogant, smart doctor, unless you want to be a surgeon or a radiologist or something like that,” he said. “But if you’re dealing with patients, you’re knocking at the door and you’re being invited in. You have to be a good guest.”

In the early 1980s, he began working at U.C.L.A. hospital’s child-abuse team. He watched as babies were wheeled into the hospital in the middle of the night because their parents didn’t know how to soothe them or had badly shaken them when they screamed uncontrollably. “It was perplexing to me, because I thought: We could put a man on the moon. We could cure some types of cancer. We could make long-distance phone calls around the world. But we don’t know why babies cry, and we don’t know how to help them sleep.”

This issue of infant colic — of otherwise healthy babies who cry for more than three hours a day, at least three days a week, in the first three months of life — gnawed at him, and he immersed himself in books on evolution and anthropology. He learned about a Pygmy tribe that passes around babies between different community members all day long so that children develop multiple relationships early. He read the fieldwork of the anthropologist Melvin Konner about the infants of the !Kung San people in the Kalahari, who are carried in slings and rarely cry for more than a minute at a time. In the West, about 15 to 20 percent of babies have colic. “So either the !Kung babies were mutant babies — different from others — or those parents knew something.”

One day, when he was 29, Karp felt a dull pain in his neck as he was heading back to the hospital from lunch. He asked an intern to perform an EKG on him, but the intern didn’t know how to read the results. “So I’m showing him, ‘Here — oh, my God, this is cardiac ischemia.’ ” What he was reading was his own heart attack. He was kept in the hospital for a week for observation and advised to eat half a pound of salmon a day to reduce his cholesterol. The incident was mild enough that it didn’t have lasting effects, but it left him with a greater sense of urgency. “It was a crystalline moment,” he told me, of coming to terms with his own limitations. From then on, whenever he went for a run in Santa Monica and reached an area with outdoor stairs, he forced himself to think, as he descended, that at the very bottom “is the end of my life and to prepare for that.”

Before the heart attack, he had planned on going into child-development research, but now he thought the demands of academia would be too taxing. Instead, he joined a practice in Los Angeles with two other pediatricians and began to develop a local following. He threw himself into the job. Early in his career, he resolved never to do a checkup for less than half an hour. On some days, he visited six different hospitals to meet his newborn patients. As his work got more demanding, Karp and his wife grew apart and divorced.

Karp was beginning to develop his concept of the “missing fourth trimester.” Human babies are born about three months prematurely, the theory goes, because their heads, which grow rapidly, need to be able to fit through the birth canal. Some scientists dispute Karp’s notion that human gestation is too short. “Sadly, the evidence doesn’t support that,” Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard, told me. But Karp insists that this explains why during the first months of life, babies can be lulled back into a womblike “trance” through the use of certain cues that Karp calls the 5 S’s: a combination of swaddling, shushing, placing the baby on her side or stomach, swinging her and letting her suck. He noticed that for each baby the “symphony of sensations” was slightly different — some babies needed extra movement, others a light jiggle — though all the infants responded well to swaddling, even if they seemed resistant at first.

By the early 1990s, Karp was running his own clinic, with a playground out back, and eventually he hired four pediatricians to work with him. “At the time, if you could get in to see Dr. Karp, then you’ve got it made,” Elaine Hall, whose son became a patient of Karp’s in 1996, told me. “He had a kind of hippie vibe to him then. He was gentle and comforting, and he had a long ponytail.” Karp gave her son a diagnosis of severe autism when he was 2. “Dr. Karp took me aside, and I’ll never forget — I get teary — he said: ‘You’re going to go on a journey. It’s a different path than you envisioned, but I can promise you you’re going to have lots of experiences that are going to make your life richer than you even imagined.”

Karp became famous for what were then unconventional methods for bonding with infants. Deena Goldstone, the mother of one of Karp’s first patients, remembers Karp suggesting that she swaddle her newborn at night, “which I thought made no sense,” she told me. Karp also advised Goldstone’s husband to hold their baby against his bare chest, in what doctors now tout as the importance of skin-to-skin contact. As his reputation grew, Hollywood celebrities took their children to see him; he treated the kids of Madonna, Michelle Pfeiffer and Larry David.

He also had a new family. He and Montée met at a party in Hollywood in 1991, when he was 40, divorced with no children. She was 11 years younger, with a 7-year-old daughter, Lexi, from a previous marriage. Montée is from Belgrade and has a highly polished complexion and the kind of thick, open-syllabled accent in English that makes “best” sound like “bast.” (Her uncle is Milan Panic, a pharmaceutical multimillionaire and former prime minister of Yugoslavia.) Karp appeared to her so unassuming that when he told her that he took care of the hosts’ son, “I thought, Oh, he’s their ‘manny,’ ” Montée told me.

In 2000, a famous actress brought in her young son to see Karp. She was accompanied by her baby nurse, a British woman named Tracy Hogg. Karp demonstrated his methods for soothing babies, including swaddling and his theory about the calming reflex. About six months later, he says, he heard that Hogg was working on a manuscript about how to calm a baby. That book, called “Secrets of the Baby Whisperer,” went on to become a best seller later that year: “You have to re-create the womb,” it advises, before going on to recommend swaddling infants tightly. “It had nothing to do with my stuff,” Karp said diplomatically. “But it got publishers interested.” Hogg, who died in 2004, advocated what she called a “structured routine” for a newborn — with precise hours for feeding, “activity,” sleeping and “you” time. Karp got to work on his own book, wanting to document his techniques for calming crying while promoting a more lenient approach. He visited his patients at home in order to test out his theories. “I needed to understand, When does it not work?” he said. “I needed to see it in the wild.” He often worked through the night, reciting bullet-pointed thoughts into dictation software because he was frustrated by the pace of his typing, then drove Lexi to school in the mornings wearing the same outfit as the day before.

Karp’s agent turned down a $450,000 advance for the manuscript, and Karp grew apprehensive that they wouldn’t get a better offer. That morning, Montée gave her husband a pep talk. “Act like you have a million dollars in your backpack,” she told him, a joke that is now part of the family lore. She turned out to be right: Karp ended up securing a $1.1 million advance for “The Happiest Baby on the Block,” along with a sequel for toddlers. Karp describes Montée as the one in the household who “seals the deal.” At Happiest Baby Inc., she is in charge of business strategy and creative direction (“As a co-founder, Ruth, I’m so excited,” she told me more than once, having mastered the marketing technique of first-name repetition).

A segment on “Good Morning America” in 2002 helped cement Karp’s success, and Montée had the idea of bringing the book’s testimonial sections to life by recording Karp’s interactions with his patients on DVD. Their timing couldn’t have been better. “The Happiest Baby on the Block” came out just as parenting literature was undergoing a transition of its own.

For years, the prevailing philosophy on child rearing had been Dr. Benjamin Spock’s rallying call to parents: “Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.” Spock’s “The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care,” which was published in 1946 and sold more than 50 million copies worldwide, was so thoroughly embraced that some women kept copies of his paperback all over the house, including in their glove compartments. Detractors later blamed him for the permissiveness that they argued set the stage for the 1960s counterculture — for children being “Spocked when they should have been spanked.” In the late ’60s, Spock’s involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement caused some of his readers to turn on him. His sales figures soon dropped by half, though he remains, to this day, the world’s most famous pediatrician.

As Spock lost ground, the field of expert advice became more polarized between a “hard” camp, which stressed discipline and conformity, and a “soft” camp, which believed in the importance of bonding and individuality. The issue of baby sleep was particularly contentious. In 1985, Dr. Richard Ferber, who founded what is now known as the Sleep Center at Boston Children’s Hospital, published a sleep manual so popular that his name became a verb. To “Ferberize” is now synonymous with letting a child cry it out (even though his book doesn’t quite advocate that). Following Ferber’s best seller, child-rearing literature was inundated with sleep guides, each with its own impossibly alluring title — “Twelve Hours Sleep by Twelve Weeks Old,” “The No-Cry Sleep Solution.”

The soaring popularity of sleep guides may have been propelled by an observable, objective deterioration in baby sleep, which can be traced back to a single year, 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics, upon reviewing research on sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, came out with the recommendation that parents put babies to sleep exclusively on their backs in the first year of life. The number of SIDS cases did in fact fall — by half, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. But the change came at a price. Babies sleep significantly worse on their backs, a fact that pediatricians openly acknowledge.

Certain parental concerns have vanished with technological advances like infant formula or polio vaccines. Others — like our anxiety about said technological advances — are perennial: Speaking to mothers in 1910, the pediatrician L. Emmett Holt worried about sensory overload in “these days of factory and locomotive whistles, trolley cars and automobiles.” But sleep — how much our children, and by extension we, get; whether it’s continuous or interrupted, light or deep, crying-induced or self-soothed — is a particularly of-the-moment obsession, particularly among well-off parents. The intense focus on sleep may have less to do with babies and more to do with parents, especially middle-class mothers, who provide as much as or more child care today than housewives did in the 1960s. Highly educated working mothers, Brigid Schulte, the author of “Overwhelmed: Work Love and Play When No One Has the Time,” told me in an email, have “made their children such a priority” that they spend “virtually all of their leisure time with their children.”

As baby sleep came to be seen as a national problem, the pressure intensified on parents to enforce stricter regimens. Champions of “hard” advice became known as parent-centered. Many of these advocates were from the Christian right, including Gary Ezzo, whose “On Becoming Baby Wise,” published in 1995, promoted rigid feeding schedules, “highchair manners” and physical punishment, or “chastisement” — preferably with a rubber spatula. (These recommendations have since changed.) Ezzo’s and other parent-centered advice books grew in direct opposition to the “ideological humanists” of the child-centered approach, with their insistence on feeding on demand, co-sleeping and a shunning of schedules and training methods.

Parent-centered advocates inveighed against the 1993 “Baby Book” — the bible of child-centered parents, written by William and Martha Sears, a pediatrician-and-nurse couple and parents of eight children. The “Baby Book” begins with an aphorism that puts many women at a disadvantage before they’ve even started mothering: “Feeling good about your baby’s birth carries over into feeling good about your baby.” (Tell that to the woman recovering from an emergency C-section.) They go on to ask, hypothetically, “Won’t holding our baby a lot, responding to cries, breast-feeding on cue and even sleeping with baby create a spoiled and overly dependent child?” To which they provide an emphatic answer: “No!” (Their son Robert, who is also a pediatrician and a “Baby Book” co-author, has become a vocal critic of vaccination laws, counter to evidence-based medical consensus.) Though they see themselves as Spock’s disciples, experts from the soft camp can seem exceedingly hard on parents, especially mothers, not to mention downright punitive for anyone with a full-time job.

Karp’s manual represented a welcome middle ground. “I try to be an omnivore and just reflect on each issue and judge it on its own merit or lack of merit, but I’m much closer to the Dr. Sears approach,” he said. He emphasizes the benefits of breast-feeding but argues that experts have become “dogmatic and inflexible about it to the point where we could be hurting kids and certainly hurting mothers.” He includes sections in his books on weaning — from swaddling, pacifiers, rocking — even as he dismisses professionals who warn that children could become addicted to these crutches. (“Are we ‘addicted’ to sleeping on a bed with a pillow?” he retorts.)

Karp “kind of serves the purpose that Grandma would have served in the past,” Alison Gopnik, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the book “The Philosophical Baby,” told me. “But what science tells us is that variability is the most distinctive feature in terms of what children are like, what parents are like and what caregiving is like. So it’s unlikely that you’re going to find one piece of advice that’s going to suit all the different varieties of children and cultures.”

Karp’s manner is open, engaging, empathetic, inviting confession; ask him about his work, though, and the layers of humility begin to peel off. “Nobody else noticed this stuff in the whole world!” he told me at the end of dinner one evening when we talked about the 5 S’s. “No one knew about swaddling. Nobody knew about sleep.” As “The Happiest Baby on the Block” began to take off, Karp left his pediatric practice and with Montée turned the “Happiest Baby” into a franchise that now includes three books, two DVDs, a line of swaddles and white noises for purchase on iTunes, as well as SNOO, which rocks and plays white noise continuously and has sensors that respond to a baby’s cry by changing intensities; it keeps the baby swaddled and fastened inside the crib and can be controlled from afar on a smartphone.

Karp earnestly compares the $1,200 bassinet to the advent of penicillin — “I’m not here to promote a product, but I am saying if someone developed penicillin, wouldn’t it be important to tell people about it?” — and insists that it can save lives by stopping babies from rolling into an unsafe position in their sleep. Raising the money for SNOO, Karp drew on his celebrity appeal: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are investors, as are Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Zoe Saldana. (Or, as Montée put it, “We have Justin and Jessica and Gwyneth and Scarlett and Zoe.”)

So far, 30,000 beds have gone into production, and of those, some were given free or at a steep markdown to social “influencers” — a far cry from Karp’s days of working with abused children. Hulu and Activision have begun offering discounted SNOOs as a benefit to their employees. Karp says he hopes to take SNOO beyond the gated precincts of Los Angeles and Silicon Valley: “Once we get medical studies, we can get insurance companies and employers to subsidize this. It will be like breast pumps ultimately. That’s the goal.”

Other “Happiest Baby” innovations can be viewed as truly helpful or slightly ominous, depending on your level of credulity. Its engineers are aiming to update the SNOO app to serve as a dutiful personal assistant, providing parents a full report on their child in the morning, like “Baby Sophie’s diaper is full; she had a runny nose; the humidifier is on,” Montée explained one morning when I visited the company’s headquarters in a squat building on a main drag in Santa Monica. She saw my face. “I know,” she said. “At the beginning I thought, Come on, really? But then I see Lexi’s friends, and they turn to an app just to tell them which breast they fed from last. It’s a different generation.”

“Hey, love!” Karp called out to Montée as we walked through their house on a recent weekend afternoon. They live in a converted A-frame chalet nestled deep in the hills of the Pacific Palisades that looks like the ideal location for a dream sequence in a film set in 2030. It has a hydraulic door with a laser-perforated metal screen, smooth white terrazzo floors, white floating stairs and an arresting view of the ocean. There are no visible light switches anywhere (Montée is “allergic”) and nothing made of plastic: Karp and Montée are environmental activists, and both serve as directors of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. With its glass facades and sharp corners, their house also looks decidedly un-baby-proofed. Perhaps the only indication of Karp’s profession can be found upstairs, in his study, where there is a first-edition Dr. Spock and a cloth baby carrier from the Peruvian Amazon — a gift from Olivia Newton-John and her husband.

Karp has devoted his entire career to babies, so it came as a surprise to learn that he has never raised one of his own. For two years after he and Montée married, they tried to conceive but couldn’t. Devastated, they considered surrogacy or adoption but in the end decided against it. “We had Lexi,” Karp explained. He came back to that decision in a later conversation. “I kind of feel like everyone is my child,” he told me, his eyes glistening. “I don’t feel the barriers. There’s this passage in ‘Siddhartha,’ by Hermann Hesse, where Siddhartha’s friend Govinda looks into his face and sees the flow of thousands of human faces like a procession. It’s our joining of humanity.” Does this mean that he views all the children he has treated over the years as, in some sense, his own? “And their parents,” he said keenly.

Part of the appeal of Karp’s methods for calming babies was that they didn’t require anything fancy, not even the pre-made swaddles that are sold today — any old blanket would do. As he himself noted in his book, “For thousands of years, the most skilled parents have used the 5 S’s to soothe their babies.” Now he was suggesting that, actually, the best way to improve your baby’s sleep required splurging on a sensory bed. Effective as his invention may be, its forbidding price reflects an old-fashioned idea: that child rearing is inherently tied to social status, that you have to spend in order to care.

As the sun began to set over the ocean, the light glinting on the water like sequins, Karp and Montée still had a long night of work ahead. “We can stay up more than any youngsters and do — how do you say? Overnighters?” Montée said. In the coming months, they would launch SNOO in China, and Karp would go on the Home Shopping Network to advertise it. For him, though, that was just the beginning. He mused about Gutenberg’s invention of movable type and how his contemporaries had been alarmed that people wouldn’t memorize anything anymore because of it. He chuckled. “You can’t get in the way of progress,” he said. Then, standing by the patio with his hands in his pockets, he put it differently: “The idea is that I could be in every nursery in America.”Photo

The 40-year-old man stared into the mirror. Lowering his razor, he lifted his chin to see if the lima-bean-size lump was still visible on the right side of his neck, just under his jawbone. His fingers quickly found the small double-lobed bulge. When he first saw it, while shaving maybe a couple of weeks earlier, it was a little tender. The soreness had gone away, but still, the lump made him nervous. Years ago, a friend had found a lump near her collarbone and ended up dying of cancer. He was due for his yearly physical, so he made an appointment to see his doctor. It was probably nothing — but he wanted to hear it from a professional.

Seeking Reassurance

Dr. Katharine DeGeorge, a family-medicine doctor in a small practice just outside Charlottesville, Va., greeted her patient warmly. He was a healthy guy and always fun to talk to. A couple of years ago, he took up long-distance running, and now he was logging 30 to 40 miles most weeks. He told her that he recently had run his first ultramarathon — 50 kilometers, or just over 31 miles. Now he was training for the Chicago Marathon and, after that, a 100-kilometer race. Over all, he felt well, except for this small bump he found under his chin. He thought it was probably a swollen lymph node, but it had been there for a while, he said, and he was a little worried about it. Any sores on your face or in your mouth? the doctor asked. The man told her he’d had a little sore on the inside of his mouth, but it was gone now.

When DeGeorge examined the patient, she easily located the nodule he was worrying about. It was almost a centimeter long and felt a little rubbery. Most of the time, lymph nodes are too small to feel, but when fighting off an infection, they can grow. But even enlarged, they usually have a soft texture. DeGeorge was surprised at how firm this one felt. It was easily moved around — that was normal — and not at all tender. She told him that the lymph node was probably a response to the sore he had in his mouth. It often takes more than four weeks for these nodes to recede. Still, she would get blood tests just to make sure there was nothing else going on. And she would refer him to an ear, nose and throat doctor (E.N.T.). If the node went back to normal before the appointment — it often took weeks to get in to see subspecialists — he could cancel.

Some Unexpected Results

The doctor was again surprised, later that day, to find a couple of abnormalities in the blood work she ordered. She was reassured by the patient’s normal white-blood-cell count — it made the possibility of a hidden infection or a malignancy much less likely. But his red-blood-cell count was slightly low, and his bilirubin level was a little high. Bilirubin is a breakdown product of the iron-containing parts of blood and muscle as well as certain proteins in the body. But most of the bilirubin in the system comes from red blood cells as they are destroyed — either naturally, at the end of their 115-day life span, or earlier by some type of trauma or disease. This waste product is quickly disposed of through the gastrointestinal tract, and so levels of bilirubin are normally extremely low. But the patient’s bilirubin was one and a half times the normal level.

The usual cause of elevated bilirubin is liver disease — the liver turns the waste product into something that can be disposed of through the gut. If there is something wrong with the liver, the bilirubin might build up to a higher-than-normal level. Based on his exam, labs and absence of symptoms, however, this man’s liver seemed completely healthy.

Red-Blood-Cell Results

Still, bilirubin goes up when red blood cells are destroyed at a higher-than-normal rate. And his blood count was a smidgen low. One abnormal lab test result could be an error, but when two linked test results are off, it suggests that the findings are real. She called the lab and added a third test to check the level of a protein called haptoglobin. This protein’s job is to clean up the detritus of discarded red blood cells. Because red blood cells are usually destroyed at a consistent rate — as they reach the end of their useful lives — the level of haptoglobin is usually stable. If more blood is being destroyed than usual, the level of haptoglobin drops. And indeed, his haptoglobin level was low.Mount Kisco is just 3.1 square miles. Incorporated in 1875, it was initially a village straddling the towns of Bedford and New Castle. In 1978, it became an independent conterminous town/village whose government operates as a village.

As Mayor Gina D. Picinich said, “We are entirely in charge of our own destiny.”

Unlike some nearby communities, Mount Kisco is ethnically diverse. The village has a history of drawing immigrants — from Italy, Ireland and, more recently, Latin America.

Edward W. Brancati, village manager, estimated that of Mount Kisco’s almost 11,000 residents, close to 45 percent are Hispanic. Ms. Picinich said, “They are part of the fabric of our community.”

That blended fabric appealed to William Passidomo, 29, and his wife, Elizabeth Rylant, 31, who moved to Mount Kisco from Southern California to be closer to extended family. Mr. Passidomo, a software engineer, grew up in northern Westchester and now works in Manhattan; Ms. Rylant is a stay-at-home mother to the couple’s 3-year-old son and infant daughter. In October, they paid $527,500 for a 2,400-square-foot, four-bedroom 1969 house set on a quarter of an acre.

Like the Pickards, they appreciate the natural surroundings and the reasonable commute. They also appreciate the varied population.

“Wherever we lived, it was 99 percent white people of a certain economic standing,” Mr. Passidomo said. “It’s a more interesting culture here, a place that mirrors the rest of the world.”

What You’ll Find

Mount Kisco’s housing stock serves a spectrum of income levels and stages of life. Mr. Brancati said that nearly half the 4,094 residential units are apartments: condominiums, cooperatives and rentals, some designated as income-restricted, some for ages 55 and up.

Roughly 300 multifamily homes are situated around the downtown, with about 650 units. Approximately 1,450 single-family houses, from starter homes to million-dollar properties, are clustered in tree-shaded neighborhoods and include colonials, Victorians, ranches and Tudors, predominantly on quarter- to half-acre lots.

“You have choices here,” said Randy Faust, an agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage.

What You’ll Pay

“At certain price points, the market is hot,” said Alaina Bainlardi, an agent with Houlihan Lawrence, noting that inventory is fast-moving and low for homes priced under $800,000.

According to the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service, on April 6, there were 19 single-family homes on the market, ranging from an 813-square-foot, two-bedroom 1948 ranch, listed at $199,900, to a 5,300-square-foot, five-bedroom Victorian, built in 1906, listed for $1,650,000. There were seven condominiums, priced from $249,000 to $730,000, and 12 cooperative apartments, from $82,500 to $190,000.

For the 12-month period ending April 6, the median sales price for single-family homes was $552,450, up from $522,500 during the previous 12 months. The median price for condos was $345,000, compared to $339,250 the previous year; for co-ops, the median price was $115,000 this year, down slightly from $122,000 last year.

As for rentals, there were six units available, ranging from $1,495 to $3,450 a month. The median monthly rental during the 12-month period ending April 6 was $2,250, up from $2,100 during the previous 12 months.

The Vibe

Mount Kisco is packed with shopping, dining, health and recreational options. Strip malls with chains like Target and T.J. Maxx line the commercial Route 117. Downtown, along South Moger Avenue, Gap and Banana Republic share space with smaller shops and businesses.

Dozens of restaurants offer a variety of cuisines, including Greek, Ethiopian, Asian, Indian, Mexican, Turkish and American.

The community gathers for annual St. Patrick’s Day and Little League parades, the Mount Kisco 5K run and activities at the 116-acre Leonard Park, home to tennis courts, ball fields, pools and gymnasium, disc golf and town-sponsored summer concerts. This summer, eight additional concerts will be held in front of the library, sponsored by the two-year-old Mount Kisco Arts Council, which also organizes pop-up exhibitions.

Nature lovers can venture up the 623-foot-tall Kisco Mountain or explore the village’s wetlands on the Peninsula Trail, where, Mr. Brancati said, “you can walk a stone’s throw from the train station and be with blue herons and beavers and beautiful flowers.”

The Schools

Mount Kisco lies within the 59-square-mile Bedford Central School District, which also serves the towns of Bedford and Pound Ridge, and parts of New Castle and North Castle. Of the district’s nearly 4,100 students, kindergartners through fifth-graders attend one of five elementary schools; those living in the village of Mount Kisco go to either West Patent Elementary or Mount Kisco Elementary, which offers a dual English-Spanish language program. Sixth- through eighth-graders attend Fox Lane Middle School before moving on to Fox Lane High School; the two schools share a 90-acre campus.

On the district’s 2017 fourth-grade state assessments, 47 percent met English standards and 50 percent met math standards; statewide equivalents were 41 percent and 43 percent. For Fox Lane’s 2017 graduating class, mean SAT scores were 553 in evidence-based reading and writing and 567 in math; statewide means were 528 and 523.

The Commute

Drivers to Manhattan, 37 miles southwest, have easy access to the Saw Mill River Parkway and Interstate 684. Commuters can catch Metro-North Railroad’s Harlem Line at the Mount Kisco station. Rush-hour trains to and from Grand Central Terminal take about an hour; monthly fare is $369.

The History

For three days in July of 1781, in the heat of the American Revolution, what is now the site of Leonard Park and Northern Westchester Hospital was an encampment for 5,000 French troops. The soldiers, led by the Comte de Rochambeau, had arrived to support the colonists, according to Harold McCartney, the village historian.

After a review of Rochambeau’s troops by Gen. George Washington and a meeting between Washington and Rochambeau, the French forces joined Washington’s army for the long march to Virginia, where together they defeated the British in the decisive Battle of Yorktown. A plaque in front of the hospital memorializes the events.The property sits among five other villas and nine townhouses, and is part of the first phase of Buena Vista Park Villas, a gated community still under development in the South District neighborhood. The area, which is almost completely residential, is the only one in Gibraltar with large villas, Ms. Armstrong said.

Markets, shops and restaurants are a 10- to 15-minute drive away. Málaga-Costa del Sol Airport, in Spain, is about an hour and 15 minutes away; it has many more international flights than Gibraltar International Airport, which mainly accommodates travelers to and from Britain and Morocco, Ms. Armstrong said.

MARKET OVERVIEW

Gibraltar’s housing market is “robust,” thanks to a growing economy and very low unemployment, said Mike Nicholls, managing director at the real estate agency Chestertons Gibraltar. In recent years, the territory has become a hub for the online gambling industry and for financial technology services companies, which together account for nearly a quarter of the area’s jobs, according to a 2017 House of Commons briefing paper.

“Despite Brexit, our employment levels are going up every year,” Mr. Nicholls said, referring to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.

And Gibraltar, which is just 2.6 square miles, is currently undergoing a building boom, he said, as developers seek to meet pent-up housing demand created by the influx of foreign workers, many of whom favor the modern developments around the marinas of Ocean Village and Queensway Quay.

Recently, Mr. Nicholls said, his sales team sold 105 apartments in just three weeks in a planned high-rise yet to be publicly marketed. Part of a complex called EuroCity, the building will start construction this summer, with prices ranging from around 167,000 pounds, or just under $240,000, for a studio to more than 1 million pounds, or about $1.4 million, for a penthouse.

The government is also encouraging the redevelopment of the Upper Town neighborhood, a historic and very walkable area that has been neglected, said Jean-Paul Lugaro, owner of Mulberry Real Estate in Gibraltar. A former police barracks there was recently converted into apartments.

In the last five years, home prices have been steadily increasing, Ms. Armstrong said, after remaining flat during the global financial crisis of 2008. A new high-quality apartment sells for an average of about 5,500 to 6,000 pounds (or between $7,860 and $8,600) a square meter, compared to around 4,500 to 5,000 pounds (or about $6,400 to $7,100) five years ago, she said.

The market for rentals is also very strong, Mr. Lugaro said: “We have a huge portfolio of people looking to rent, and there are no properties for them.”

But Louis Montegriffo, managing director of BMI Group Estate Agents, said he is a little concerned that too many studio and one-bedroom apartments are coming to market. Over the next year or so, he said, around 400 new one- to four-bedroom units will become available, and another 500 to 600 studios and one-bedrooms are in the planning stages, which could overheat the lower end of the market, as speculators and buy-to-rent investors swoop in. Most of the people who are coming to live and work in Gibraltar, Mr. Montegriffo said, are interested in larger units.

WHO BUYS IN GIBRALTAR

About three-quarters of foreign buyers are British, Ms. Armstrong said. The rest are primarily European, although she said she has also worked with Israelis and Australians.

While demand is driven in large part by imported labor, the strong rental market is also attracting foreign investors, “who come along and buy 20 apartments,” she said.

The government’s tax structure tends to attract wealthy individuals, as there is no capital gains or inheritance tax. In addition, individuals with net assets in excess of 2 million pounds, or about $2.9 million, can qualify for a cap on their income tax if they buy a luxury property and meet other conditions, Mr. Lugaro said.

BUYING BASICS

There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, said Christina Wright, a lawyer in Gibraltar.

The typical deposit is 2 percent of the purchase price. Buyers hire a lawyer to handle the transaction, at a fee of roughly 0.5 percent of the price.

Stamp duty is charged on properties that sell for more than 200,000 pounds, or about $285,000, at a rate that ranges from 2 percent to 3.5 percent. But for first- and second-time buyers, Ms. Wright said, there is a waiver on the first 260,000 pounds, or about $370,000, of the sale price.

Gibraltar has a leasehold structure on most of its properties. While some old buildings are freely owned, the government owns at least 90 percent of the land, Ms. Armstrong said, and leases to developers run for 149 years.

CONTACT Emery or Dolores Maez, Keller Williams Realty, 505-469-0546; kw.comCultural trends seem to pop up early on the social media site. It’s where I first noticed the popularity of Los Angeles’s Zoe Church, which I recently wrote about, and where Sam Barsky, better known online as “the sweater guy,” gained Internet fame. (I wrote about him, too.)

So I decided to explore.

Some photographers shared secret fishing holes. Others tagged anglers with whom they seemed to have struck up friendships. The rest, well, bragged about their latest catch.

The genre had all the hallmarks of a mature social media phenomenon. A lot of people were promoting brands. So much so, one Twitter commenter asked if the fishing industry now had “influencers.” Noelle Coley of Colorado said she worked with a number of companies, receiving free fishing equipment or apparel in exchange for social media mentions. (Some outlets, like Orvis, a maker of fly fishing equipment, are seeking to increase the number of women in the sport. That’s no surprise, given that recreational fishing is on the rise in the United States and women are an untapped market.)

What was most striking, though, were the photographs themselves, which were colorful, immediate and engaging. I reached out to a number of the featured men and women from across the country and asked them to tell me their back stories.

Photo

While much of America is divided between red and blue states, these anglers recounted experiences that transcend geography and politics. They said they had friends on both coasts, as well as in the middle of the country.

Could fishing be the great uniter? That would be no small feat these days, when everything seems politicized.

They even wanted to take me fishing. But that’s another story. (A brother once chided me for catching a trout smaller than the purse I owned.)

Most of all, though, these fishing enthusiasts were eager to describe how social media helped them document their pastime so they could share it with others.

Of course the smartphone itself has revolutionized the way they capture their adventures. Long gone are the days of posing afterward on the dock with a colossal prize, like Ernest Hemingway did when he lived in Key West in the 1930s. As Daniel Giunta, the owner of the sports fishing charter company Double D Charters in Montauk, N.Y., told me, customers want photographs with their catch fresh out of the water — especially since many people choose to release the fish.

“Being a captain these days is all about being a good photographer,” he said. “I know where the light is. I know where they need to stand.”

Smartphones have also revolutionized how journalists interact with their sources and build an audience for their work. I posted a screenshot of the article I wrote, “Lots of Fish on the Screen,” on my own Instagram account, with some of the more popular hashtags the fishing crowd uses. Right away a number of fishing accounts liked it or posted comments. I got an email from the wife of a fisherman I know in Santa Cruz, Calif. More emails like that followed. One of the men I interviewed posted an excerpt from the story on his Instagram account. Another one told his followers to read it.

I even heard from Fishbrain, an app maker based in Stockholm, Sweden, which bills itself as the Facebook of fishing. People can log in to the app and see where fish are biting. Since 2016, the company said, more than 1,000 people have fished in the ponds in New York City’s Central Park, including Harlem Meer. Followers on Instagram already knew that; centralparkfishing has its own hashtag.Image Ann Magnuson performing at Kenny Scharf’s opening atop his “Ultima Suprema Deluxa” Cadillac on November 14, 1983.

Ann Magnuson, actress and performance artist

My days changed depending on what show I was putting on, what sort of rehearsal schedule I had and how late I’d been up the night before, though I had a rule for myself: Always be back before sunrise. My primary motive back then was to put on a show, and anything that slowed me down from that had to be curtailed. By 1981, I was no longer the manager at [the East Village performance space] Club 57, but I still helped out and performed there a lot. The Ladies Auxiliary of the Lower East Side — sort of a punk rock version of my mother’s Junior League group, which I started with some other girls from the East Village — hosted several events at the club. We had a prom, a debutante ball, a ladies’ wrestling night. In 1981, I suggested a bacchanal — a night of pagan merriment as spring was coming. So in April we held the Rites of Spring Fertility Bacchanal. We made an altar to a llama, and everyone dressed in kind of Greco-Roman outfits — I wore a toga with sequins. Wendy Wild made magic mushroom punch. We also created a percussive orchestra that was all pots and pans and a lot of racket, and that was the debut of the band Pulsallama. It was really like a combination of living theater and installation art, very communal. That’s what happened at Club 57 a lot: We told people, “This is the theme. Come be a part of it.” The doors would open and things would get going by 10, and by midnight it would be raging. In the mornings, usually around 11 a.m., I’d go to one of the coffee shops around the corner on Avenue A. Odessa was one, and Leshko’s was the other. People divided themselves into camps based on which one they favored — I liked Odessa better, but I’d go to both. That’s where you’d run into people, share breakfast.

When “Flashdance” came out in 1983, Paramount put me up in the Carlyle Hotel to do promotion. It was an incredible contrast from the last time I had lived in New York, when I was 17, during the summer of 1981, in a $500-a-month sublet loft that my boyfriend and I had found paging through our bible, the call to another life — The Village Voice — in his basement in Evanston. I remember I was drawn to the ad for the loft because it was in a place that sounded like “trifecta”; my father had taken me to the track, so that seemed comforting and familiar. (What a loft was, I wasn’t entirely sure.) Being at the Carlyle was amazing, but I was still an undergrad at Yale at the time, and the whole thing felt unreal, as though I was living two lives. One day, I was walking uptown to an appointment just before noon, and coming toward me was Robert Duvall. He recognized me and stopped to congratulate me on the film. It was crazy. He said he was going to lunch with some friends, and did I want to join? I couldn’t, but I did turn around and walk with him for some blocks to the restaurant. It was a brilliantly sunny day, and standing outside was Dustin Hoffman. Bob introduced us, and Dustin congratulated me on the film and told me my acting was “naturalistic.” It dawned on me that there are so many different styles of acting and you don’t have to adhere to just one. I was 19. I didn’t know anything. That completely opened my mind.

The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 is sometimes used as a marker of the beginning of the end of the art world as it was then known, as if the two were somehow related, as if an election ushered in some new aesthetic permission, a new vulgarity, which is really a kind of negative magical thinking. I doubt if many artists experienced it that way. Everyone I knew hated Reagan and couldn’t wait for him to get out of office. I remember being in someone’s loft — it might have been [artist] Brian Hunt’s — with a group of friends, watching the inauguration on a little black-and-white television. The silence, as they say, was deafening. No one could believe that this B-actor was about to occupy the White House.

Samuel R. Delany, writer

I got up at anywhere from 3 to 5 in the morning and worked as long as I could. I worked in my office at home, an eight-room walk-up on the Upper West Side. It was a very different kind of neighborhood from the one I grew up in in Harlem — just starting to be gentrified. The apartment was big, but the hall was in very bad repair, or at least looked it. “Mom says that your apartment looks like a crack den,” my daughter told me once. A “crack den” lined with books.

At 11 to 12, I’d had a nine-hour day. I would walk around the neighborhood, go down to 42nd Street and do a lot of movie cruising. I’d go for two, three, four hours and have a fairly good time. There was a theater called the Capri that I went to a lot. There were others: the Venus, and down in the 14th Street area, the Variety Photoplays, a Spanish one called The Jefferson, The Metropol [Metropolitan]. Some of them were open 24 hours a day, or they were closed maybe four hours a day for cleaning. They were relatively small, rundown theaters; they tended to have a fair amount of drug use going on. A lot of it was crack. Before that it had been pot. These places were used largely by working-class men, white, black and Latino, people who thought of themselves as straight and gay, many of whom were amenable to sexual things. They could be stimulated by the heterosexual pornography that was on the screen. This kind of activity is highly socially ordered: You don’t barge in on other people, that’s all part of it. I tended to feel particularly safe in the theaters. AIDS was a very strange situation; starting in ’82 you knew very little about it, and then a few years later you suddenly realized it was the largest killer among your personal friends. It cut down a great number of the people who were out there doing it, but at the same time, the ones who were left were much more intense about it. You weren’t afraid of getting it, you were wondering when are the symptoms going to show up.

Debbie Allen, actress

I held auditions for “Fame,” the TV show, on a Sunday at the New York School of Ballet because that’s where I trained, and Mr. Thomas [ballet dancer Richard Scott Thomas] was happy to give me a studio. I had been starring on Broadway in “West Side Story,” and I had done the movie “Ragtime,” which was also coming out, but dance has always been my heartbeat. So when they talked to me about playing the character Lydia Grant, the dance teacher, I said, “Yes, I would be so interested if I could also be responsible for the choreography.” Because by this time, I had been developing as a choreographer, working with the Henry Street Playhouse and the New York Shakespeare Festival, and I really loved doing it. And they said, “Yeah, you can have that” — they weren’t even thinking about it. They paid me like a tenth of what they paid me to do the acting, and it became my whole life. We were shooting the pilot, and I was trying to find the best dancers I could. They were supposed to be 17 or 18. Some of them were lying about their age and I knew it, but I didn’t care. I said, “To hell with it!” Jasmine Guy auditioned; she wasn’t of age yet. Bronwyn Thomas, she was like happy feet on her toes. She was the ultimate ballerina, and she became that on “Fame.” I was excited that I would be able to introduce this new band of gypsies to the Hollywood scene.

Columbia Pictures had given me this SX-70 camera at a conference, and I started documenting life in the Fire Island Pines [an area of Long Island known as a haven for gay life], which just seemed very important to me. Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago, a boy like me didn’t know there was a place for him in the world like that. Very quickly, I realized it had potential to be a book. Two editors at Simon & Schuster thought it was terrific, but they said, “You have to produce this yourself, and we can possibly get you a distribution deal. We can’t put the money out for something this queer.” Then [writer and editor] Bob Colacello saw the project and said, “Andy Warhol has a three-book deal with Houghton Mifflin. He has one book but he doesn’t have the next two. Maybe he could do your book under that contract.” So I went to the Factory and stood at a tall table with Andy and Bob, and Andy went through the dummy. It was almost a surreal experience, because I had the feeling that this person is only vaguely here. As Andy turned the pages, he said things like “Oh, that’s nice,” “Oh, that could be larger,” “Oh … ” At the end of it, he said, “Yes, I think we should do your book. I’ve gotta go to something, Bob will call you.” I took the elevator down to the street and I saw a phone booth and the first thought that came to my mind was, “Do not call any of your friends and tell them Andy Warhol is doing your book because I don’t think that’s for real.” And sure enough, he didn’t.Photo

When I arrive at the Dumbo, Brooklyn building where the artist Elliott Puckette keeps a studio, it’s as if I’ve traveled back in time — to, say, 1989, when Puckette first rented the Pearl Street space and the building was still a working paper factory. Warped wooden floorboards creak under my feet, and exposed pipes and electrical wiring line the unfinished hallway. It smells of paint and turpentine. The contrast to the sleek, granite-floored lobby is striking. “They’re renovating the building in the most absurd way, floor-by-floor,” she explains good-naturedly. “Eventually I’m getting kicked out.”

It’s a few weeks before Puckette’s upcoming show, “New Work,” at Paul Kasmin Gallery, and I expect to interrupt the artist in somewhat of a frenzied state, paint-spattered and anxious. Instead, she is serene. Dressed neatly in a short white skirt and red V-neck sweater (not, she confirms, her painting clothes), her blonde hair in a French twist and a silk scarf knotted around her neck, Puckette looks more like a gallery owner than an artist. She has the erect posture and gently turned out feet of a ballet dancer and, as we enter her studio, the air of a straight-A student who finished the assignment long ago.

Photo

Puckette has good reason to be at ease. This is her eighth solo show with Kasmin, which first exhibited her work shortly after she earned her B.F.A. from Cooper Union in 1989. “He has been very good to me all these years,” she says of the dealer, “and he knows to just leave me alone.”

A bit like her top-floor studio, which has resisted the insistent creep of luxury Brooklyn redevelopment, Puckette makes paintings today much like she did 25 years ago. She layers her large-scale square and rectangular boards with thick coats of gesso. Initially, she made the gesso herself from rabbit-skin glue and whiting, a traditional method she learned while studying old master techniques at Cooper. When this recipe started to affect her asthma, she developed her own variation using white kaolin clay. Once the surface has hardened, she applies a translucent wash of ink — lately, in muted shades of gray, black-blue and very deep purple. “I have a weird relationship with color,” she says. “It’s always sort of an afterthought.”

At top of mind has always been the line, Puckette’s career-long fascination. She doesn’t know, she says, why it intrigues her. But more than color or form, the line is both central formal element and subject — mapped out with chalk and then painstakingly etched into the surface of her pieces with a single-edge razor blade.

Photo

“I always start on the upper left-hand corner,” says Puckette, “as if I was writing.” We’re standing with our faces inches from “Love Letter,” a 15-foot-long triptych that is the largest piece in the upcoming show. A tangle of wavering, looping marks wends its way across the three panels. To demonstrate, Puckette scoops up a stray razor from the floor (“I tried to clean up!”) and begins lightly scratching at a section of line. Watching her work, it’s clear that what appears, from a distance, to be a strong line carving a single path is, in fact, made up of thousands of tiny marks.The finished space under the gabled garage roof has a stone fireplace and a full bathroom.
