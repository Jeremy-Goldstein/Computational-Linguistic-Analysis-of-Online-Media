On Trump’s Monologues

‘It was him talking almost the entire time.’

It was him talking almost the entire time, which I’ve discovered is something he frequently does. And so it would be monologue in this direction, monologue in that direction, monologue in a different direction. And a constant series of assertions that — about the inauguration crowd, about how great my inauguration speech was, about all the free media — earned media, I think was his term, that I got during the campaign. On and on and on and on. Everyone agrees, everyone agrees, I did this, the — I never assaulted these women, I never made fun of a reporter. And — I’m sure you’re wondering what question did I ask that would prompt those? None, zero. I didn’t ask any questions that I recall.

One of the most interesting observations by Mr. Comey during the interview was that Mr. Trump delivers monologues that are intended to leave the impression that those listening agree completely with him.

Mr. Comey notes on several occasions that in private conversations, the president simply makes assertions — often falsely — without giving the people he’s talking to a chance to interject or object. It’s an interesting observation because it is similar to what Mr. Trump does in public.

When he is giving remarks to a small group around a table at the White House, he often rambles from one topic to the next, making assertions that often are not true but cannot be challenged at the time because they come in such rapid-fire fashion.

And Mr. Comey notes that the president often says contradictory things in the same monologue. He noted that over dinner, the president told him that Reince Priebus, the chief of staff at the time, didn’t know they were having dinner together. But later, Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey to follow up with Mr. Priebus, who knew they were having dinner together.

“One of those things is not true. One of those things is a lie,” Mr. Comey says in the interview.

On Those Who Work With the President

‘He will stain everyone around him.’

The challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him. And the question is, how much stain is too much stain and how much stain eventually makes you unable to accomplish your goal of protecting the country and serving the country? So I don’t know.

Mr. Comey reveals in his book that John F. Kelly, the current White House chief of staff, said he wanted to resign in protest when Mr. Comey was fired. In the interview, he says he urged Mr. Kelly to stay for the good of the country.

On informing President-Elect Trump about Russia’s Meddling in the Election

‘I don’t remember any questions about, “So what are they going to do next. How might we stop it?”’

No one, to my recollection, asked, “So what — what’s coming next from the Russians?” You’re about to lead a country that has an adversary attacking it and I don’t remember any questions about, “So what are they going to do next? How might we stop it? What’s the future look like? Because we’ll be custodians of the security of this country.” There was none of that. It was all, “What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had.”

Much has been written about the meeting in Trump Tower on Jan. 6 when Mr. Comey and other intelligence officials briefed Mr. Trump and his top aides about Russian interference. Mr. Comey says that the president-elect and his aides were more concerned about how to “spin” it publicly. And he says that he got the feeling that Mr. Trump wanted to talk about the public relations effort with the intelligence chiefs there to send a message that they were part of the spin effort as well.

On Whether the Russians Are Blackmailing the President

‘I think it’s possible. I don’t know.’

STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think the Russians have something on Donald Trump? COMEY: I think it’s possible. I don’t know. These are more words I never thought I’d utter about a president of the United States, but it’s possible. STEPHANOPOULOS: That’s stunning. You can’t say for certain that the president of the United States is not compromised by the Russians? COMEY: It is stunning and I wish I wasn’t saying it, but it’s just — it’s the truth. I cannot say that. It always struck me and still strikes me as unlikely, and I would have been able to say with high confidence about any other president I dealt with, but I can’t. It’s possible.

Some of Mr. Comey’s assertions in the interview, and the book, are sure to be assailed by his critics. Among the most damning is that he cannot say for sure whether the president is being blackmailed by the Russians. He offers no proof that there is such blackmail.Four female senators — Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa — discuss women in politics, public policy, and the special bond among women of the Senate at a TimesTalks in New York.His message isn’t consistent with where things stand in global currency markets. And it’s vague. It’s not at all clear what signal he’s sending about a preferred policy.

Let unpack it.

Russia and the Ruble

The comment about Russia is curious. While Russia is of course an important geopolitical player, its sclerotic economy and isolated financial system mean that it’s not an important player in global commerce.

For example, the United States’ trade with Russia is a rounding error — $17 billion worth of imports in 2017 (Chinese imports were 31 times that high). And the ruble is not on the radar of currency traders, the way that, say, the British pound or Swiss franc is.

It’s true that the ruble has plummeted against the dollar this month, falling about 8 percent. But that isn’t because the Russian government is playing some devaluation game. The ruble fell because stringent new sanctions on influential Russians are crimping demand for the currency.Video

WASHINGTON — It has been 86 years since Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman elected to the United States Senate, and women remain woefully underrepresented in the chamber. Women make up nearly 51 percent of the United States population but just 23 percent of the Senate, an all-time high, nonetheless, after Tina Smith was sworn in as the new senator from Minnesota in January.

They form something of a tight-knit club.

They have bipartisan dinners that make their male colleagues jealous. They have banded together to solve seemingly intractable problems; in 2013, when Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, led a move to shut down the government, the women of the Senate cut a bipartisan deal to reopen it. And they have pushed their colleagues to tackle issues like sexual harassment, domestic violence and sexual assault in the military.

On Sunday, four female senators — Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota, Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa — discussed women in politics, public policy, and the special bond among women in the Senate at a TimesTalks forum in New York. (Ms. Ernst, waylaid by an Iowa snowstorm, arrived toward the end.)

Here are some of the session’s lighter moments, offering a peek behind the scenes of life as a woman in the Senate:

Who me? Run for public office?

Ms. Collins says she is often called upon to recruit women (and men) who are thinking of running for office. Many women tell her that they do not feel quite ready. “I have never, ever had a man say that to me, that he wasn’t quite ready,” she said, adding, “I think there’s a self-doubt and a hesitancy to take risks that we need to overcome.”

Women have also historically had a tougher time raising money, said Ms. Klobuchar, who in 2006 became the first woman elected to the Senate from her state. On that score, she said she believes she set a record during her first run for Senate: “I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.”Photo

WASHINGTON — President Trump resumed his attacks Monday on James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and said that Mr. Comey, his former deputy and others “committed many crimes!”

The president — in his first Twitter post since the airing of Mr. Comey’s first public interview about his months serving in the Trump administration — again accused Mr. Comey of lying to Congress, but he did not specify which other crimes he believed Mr. Comey and others committed.

In his tweet, Mr. Trump mentioned the former deputy F.B.I. director Andrew G. McCabe, whom Mr. Trump fired just before Mr. McCabe was eligible for his pension after 21 years at the bureau.

And the president referenced Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton, in part, blames Mr. Comey’s handling of the email case for her not winning the presidency.

In his Monday morning tweet, Mr. Trump accused Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe of committing “many crimes.” It was posted just a few hours before the president’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, was to appear before a federal judge in New York related to an ongoing investigation into possible bank fraud.

In his five-hour interview with ABC’s chief anchor, George Stephanopoulos, on the program “20/20,” Mr. Comey said it was possible that the president obstructed justice when he asked Mr. Comey to let go of the investigation into Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

Mr. Comey also said the president “lies constantly about matters big and small.”

Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Mr. Comey is a liar. And the Republican National Committee has launched a “Lyin’ Comey” website to push back against claims in Mr. Comey’s book, which is coming out on Tuesday.The justices will consider how much weight to give to Mr. Trump’s campaign statements. And they will act in the shadow of their own decision in Korematsu v. United States, which endorsed Roosevelt’s 1942 order and is almost universally viewed as a shameful mistake.

The Justice Department has worked hard to limit the damage from Mr. Trump’s campaign statements, which were often extemporaneous and rambling. It was hard to tell, for instance, precisely which Roosevelt policies Mr. Trump referred to or endorsed in his 2015 remarks.

“Impugning the official objective of a formal national security and foreign policy judgment of the president based on campaign trail statements is inappropriate and fraught with intractable difficulties,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the justices in a brief filed in February.

The challengers — Hawaii, several individuals and a Muslim group — took a different view. Mr. Trump’s order, they said, was “the fulfillment of the president’s promise to prohibit Muslim immigration to the United States.”

A pair of supporting briefs, from children of Japanese-Americans held in the detention camps and several public interest groups, went further. They said Mr. Trump’s latest travel ban is of a piece with Roosevelt’s order.

“History teaches caution and skepticism when vague notions of national security are used to justify vast, unprecedented exclusionary measures that target disfavored classes,” lawyers for the Japanese American Citizens League told the justices.

There are, of course, major differences between the two orders, as legal scholars have noted. Roosevelt’s order applied to people living in the United States, many of them citizens, while Mr. Trump’s order concerned nationals of other countries living abroad. (The countries initially included Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. Last week, the administration lifted restrictions on travel from Chad.)

In enforcing Roosevelt’s order, moreover, the military singled out “persons of Japanese ancestry.” Mr. Trump’s order, by contrast, is neutral on its face, though it disproportionately affects Muslims.

Still, the legacy of the Korematsu decision figured in opinions in recent appeals court decisions blocking Mr. Trump’s third and most considered travel ban, issued as a presidential proclamation in September.

The Korematsu decision occupies a curious place in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence, as a grave error that has never been formally disavowed.

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that Korematsu ranks with Dred Scott, the 1857 decision that black slaves were property and not citizens, as among the court’s most disastrous rulings.

In 1982, a congressional commission concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans was “a grave injustice” animated by “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.” It added that “the decision in Korematsu lies overruled in the court of history.”

But the Supreme Court has never overruled the decision. It remains, in the words of Justice Robert Jackson’s dissent, “a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need.”

The supporting briefs in the new case, Trump v. Hawaii, No. 17-965, urged the justices to consider the similarities between the two executive orders. “Then, as now,” one said, “the government pursued a mass exclusionary measure of sweeping and senseless scope.” Both orders, the briefs said, relied on general characteristics like ancestry and nationality in the place of individualized scrutiny.

In defending the Japanese internment, the Justice Department told the Supreme Court that “the group as a whole contained an unknown number of persons who could not readily be singled out and who were a threat to the security of the nation.” Mr. Trump’s executive order bars entry of large numbers of people “about whom the United States lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose.”

In 2011, Neal K. Katyal, then the acting United States solicitor general, issued a “confession of error” for the actions of government lawyers in the Korematsu case. Mr. Katyal now represents the challengers in the case against Mr. Trump’s travel ban, and he may face an uphill fight next week. In December, the Supreme Court allowed the latest travel ban to take effect while the case moved forward, with only two justices noting dissents.

But there is little doubt that all of the justices view the case as momentous. On Friday, the court announced that it would release an audio recording of the arguments shortly after they end. That is a rare step, one the court reserves for cases likely to face historical scrutiny.By the time ABC aired an hourlong interview with James B. Comey on Sunday night, his feelings on President Trump were clear: that he was volatile, immoral, fixated on allegations made against him, akin to a mob boss.

When excerpts from Mr. Comey’s forthcoming memoir emerged last week, Mr. Trump pounced, labeling Mr. Comey “weak” and an “untruthful slime ball.” He later suggested Mr. Comey deserved jail time.

The disclosures in the book, many of which were amplified in extraordinary detail in Sunday’s interview, were a stunning assault on a sitting president by a former high-ranking law enforcement official.

The Republican pollster who had planned to split time advising both Vice President Mike Pence and the United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, on national security issues withdrew from the dual role on Sunday night, a White House official said.

The move by the veteran strategist, Jon Lerner, who has no national security background, came two days after President Trump learned of the unusual time-sharing plan between Mr. Pence and Ms. Haley. Mr. Trump was displeased by the move for several reasons, according to three administration officials.

“Tonight, Jon informed the vice president that he was withdrawing from coming on board as national security adviser, and the vice president accepted his decision,” said Alyssa Farah, the press secretary for Mr. Pence. “Vice President Pence holds Jon Lerner in the highest regard and expressed his deep gratitude for Jon’s willingness to consider joining our team.”

Mr. Lerner will continue in his role advising Ms. Haley and, one White House official said, continue to informally advise the Pence team.

Mr. Trump was upset about the move for two main reasons: Mr. Lerner’s background with the “super PAC” that supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primaries, and his work advising the anti-tax group Club for Growth, which savaged Mr. Trump in ads during the campaign. At least one official suggested to the president that Mr. Lerner may have been connected to extensive opposition research efforts against him.WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign has ramped up its fund-raising this year, bringing in $20.2 million, while investing heavily in cultivating a wide base of small donors, according to reports filed Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission.

Mr. Trump’s campaign apparatus spent nearly $8.2 million through the end of last month, with more than 60 percent of that going toward low-dollar fund-raising tools such as solicitations delivered via social media, email, direct mail and telemarketing, the reports show.

The reports were filed by Mr. Trump’s campaign and two joint committees it formed with the Republican National Committee: Trump Victory Committee and Trump Make America Great Again Committee.

The committees also spent $863,000 on legal fees as Mr. Trump, his campaign and associates continue to deal with a handful of legal fights, as well as the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.Mr. Pence’s very presence at the Summit of the Americas this weekend was just such an effort: Mr. Trump had abruptly withdrawn from plans to attend, citing the run-up to the military strike in Syria. But the cancellation came as Mr. Trump was also consumed by personal and political drama, and it was the first time a United States president had avoided the summit meeting, which occurs every three years, in its 24-year history.

Mr. Pence has increasingly stepped in overseas for a president who appears not to relish international travel. This was his third foreign trip and his sixth country so far this year — after multicountry swings through the Middle East and Asia — while the president has made a sole trip outside the United States in 2018, to Davos, Switzerland.

“It would not be surprising to see Pence taking a larger international role in advocating Trump administration foreign policies on the international stage,” John R. Bolton, now Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, wrote in an op-ed in January. Mr. Bolton said Mr. Pence had proved “adept at navigating the complexities of Middle Eastern politics,” and provided a “reassuring contrast” to partisan bickering at home.

In Lima, armed with a thick binder of briefing materials, Mr. Pence delivered meticulously scripted statements printed on cards that he toted around the summit meeting site and read from faithfully, hitting on his main theme of preserving the region as a “hemisphere of freedom,” a phrase he repeated at least three times in his closing remarks. The vice president hailed the military action in Syria and denounced the crisis in Venezuela that has led to a humanitarian catastrophe there, calling upon the assembled nations to support tough measures against the governments of both countries.

Mr. Pence’s disciplined delivery of the American message after the Syria strikes stood in contrast to the presidential tweet, which recalled an earlier president’s premature declaration of victory in Iraq and prompted a spate of bitter criticism.

What the president had meant by his tweet, Mr. Pence explained to reporters traveling with him on Saturday, was that the mission that Mr. Trump had given American forces, “to go in and destroy key elements of the chemical weapons infrastructure in Syria, was completely and professionally and swiftly accomplished.”

But that was not the only issue on which Mr. Pence worked to modulate Mr. Trump’s pronouncements here. In a meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, the vice president said, he steered clear of talking about funding for the border wall that Mr. Trump has long demanded Mexico pay for. Mr. Pence chalked up the disagreement — which recently torpedoed plans for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Peña Nieto — to two presidents with “strong personalities.”

“When you have two people with strong personalities, they occasionally have strong differences,” Mr. Pence told reporters. “We talked through those differences, some of which we set aside for a later date.”

Instead, Mr. Pence accentuated the positive: namely, progress in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he said had a chance of being successfully completed within weeks.

As Mr. Pence taxied for takeoff on Air Force Two on Friday for the trip to Lima, the president appeared to be focused elsewhere. He tapped out a tweet branding James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whose forthcoming memoir paints him as a liar and Mafia-style bully, “an untruthful slime ball.” Privately, Mr. Trump continued to seethe over the F.B.I. raid days earlier on his personal lawyer in a wide-ranging corruption investigation that he views as a grave threat.

At the summit meeting in Peru, Mr. Pence spoke in loftier terms, trying to reassure the other leaders that Mr. Trump meant no slight in failing to show up for their gathering. Mr. Trump, he told President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, was “disappointed” that he could not make the trip — which was to have included a stop in Bogotá to meet with Mr. Santos — but, he added, “I can assure you that the relationship with our country has never been stronger.”

Mr. Pence’s attendance at the summit meeting was not without its sharper moments. In his closing speech, the vice president denounced the Cuban government as a “despotic regime” that had impoverished its people and abused human rights, prompting the country’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, who sat listening several chairs away, to demand the chance for a rebuttal. As Mr. Rodríguez was recognized and began to speak, Mr. Pence abruptly stood and strode out of the summit hall.

But the vice president labored in a way his boss does not to avoid creating controversies. Mr. Pence called elections scheduled for next month in Venezuela a “sham” that would not fool the world, but when a reporter asked whether the United States would refuse to recognize the outcome, he deferred to John J. Sullivan, the acting secretary of state, who was traveling with him, to state the official policy, so as not to risk diverging even slightly from it.

Mr. Pence’s presence as a stand-in for Mr. Trump may have undercut the United States’ goals at the summit meeting, taking some of the sting out of the fact that President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela had been disinvited and raising questions about the United States’ commitment to the region.

But the vice president also defused some of the tension that would have attended an encounter between Mr. Trump and the leaders of Latin American nations who have been insulted and angered by his talk on immigration and other topics, said Richard E. Feinberg, a senior fellow in the Latin America Initiative at the Brookings Institution.

“A lot of leaders probably were preparing two sets of remarks: one if Trump behaves himself, to focus on the issues, and one for if he misbehaves and says something offensive,” Mr. Feinberg said. “With Trump not being here, they can discard the second set. Pence behaves himself.”“It’s important to have reporters based in parts of America where some people feel misunderstood,” she said. “It just helps us get a greater understanding of who we are and who our neighbors are.”

Report for America fellowships last one to two years, and the pay is about $40,000, with half covered by the program and the rest split between participating news organizations and donations. Two media veterans, Steven Waldman and Charles Sennott, started the project with funding from sponsors.

“People are applying for the same reason people want to go into the Peace Corps: There’s an idealistic desire to help communities, and there’s a sense of adventure,” Mr. Waldman, 55, said. “They want to try and save democracy. People keep saying that.”

Historically, reporters would start their careers at small publications and move on to progressively larger ones. These days, young journalists tend to find work right out of college — but the jobs they end up with often don’t require them to spend time talking to story subjects face to face or learning about different communities.

“Maybe they have done that Brooklyn thing, where you spend a year or two in a cubicle working for a blog,” Mr. Sennott, 55, said. “But that’s not the same as being on the ground doing the real work, knocking on a door and walking into someone’s kitchen.”

In 1990, daily and weekly newspaper publishers employed about 455,000 people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2016, that number had fallen to 173,000.

Before the creation of Report for America, Mr. Waldman ran Beliefnet, a site dedicated to faith and spirituality, and worked for the Federal Communications Commission as a senior adviser. In 2015, he wrote a paper funded by the Ford Foundation arguing for the creation of a national service program for journalists.

The other founder, Mr. Sennott, once worked as the Jerusalem-based Middle East bureau chief for The Boston Globe. He has covered wars and insurgencies in more than a dozen countries. In 2014, he founded GroundTruth, a nonprofit organization that trains foreign correspondents. He decided to join Mr. Waldman in establishing Report for America after the 2016 election.

“I was focused on reporting on divided societies and struggling democracies,” Mr. Sennott said. “Then I realized we live in one.”

Because they had seen how Facebook and Google contributed to the destruction of the advertising-based business model that had long kept local newspapers afloat, they asked them to kick in to their project. While Google has committed money and training, Facebook has yet to sign on.

“Mark Zuckerberg could solve the local news problem with the money that’s falling between his couch cushions,” Mr. Waldman said. “Folks like Facebook and Google and the other winners have the money to solve this problem, and it is a solvable problem.”

In parts of the country where newsrooms are filled with empty desks, tracking down stories can be depressingly easy, the organizers said. Will Wright, a reporter who was placed at The Lexington Herald Leader through the program, helped break a major story simply by attending a community meeting in eastern Kentucky and talking to residents who had been without running water for days.

Soon after his reporting, the person in charge of the water district went into retirement, and the state found $3.4 million to fix the water system.

“You don’t need a 20-year veteran investigative reporter to have this impact,” Mr. Waldman said. “It’s so barren out there that just being on the ground can have a really big impact.”

“He showed up,” Mr. Sennott said. “He was just there.”

For the nine reporter slots, 85 newsrooms applied asking for corps members, describing a crucial beat that needed filling. Reporters who make the cut start with eight days of training before joining their host newsrooms. They must also fulfill a service requirement, such as working as mentors to student journalists, during their stints.

The founders refer to those who take part in the program as “corps members,” rather than fellows, an attempt to signal that Report for America is not meant to be simply a chance to burnish a résumé.

“It’s not a reward for bright young graduate students,” Mr. Sennott said. “It’s a call to get in there.”On Trump’s Monologues

Russia & Syria must cooperate.” Other Western diplomats confirmed that Syria and Russia were impeding the team.

Senior Russian diplomats said it was the United Nations, not Syria or Russia, that had prevented inspectors from entering Douma. “The problem was the absence of the U.N. Secretariat security department’s approval for O.P.C.W. experts to visit Douma,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister of Russia, told reporters, according to the news agency Interfax.

A spokesman for the United Nations, Stéphane Dujarric, disputed the Russian explanation. “The U.N. has given them all the necessary clearances,” he said by telephone. “We’re supporting the team as much as we can.”

Later at his regular noon briefing, Mr. Dujarric said of the O.P.C.W. experts: “We’ve not denied them any sort of clearance.”

Mr. Dujarric declined to say whether Secretary General António Guterres would demand that Russia and Syria provide the experts with access to the Douma site. But the spokesman said Mr. Guterres wanted the investigation to move forward “so we can have a full picture of all the facts.”

The United States ambassador to the organization said at the meeting on Monday that Russia could be trying to conceal evidence of chemical weapons.

“It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site,” the ambassador, Kenneth D. Ward, said. “We are concerned they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the O.P.C.W. fact-finding mission to conduct an effective investigation.”

In an interview with the BBC, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said, “I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site.”

The United States and its allies Britain and France used missiles on Saturday to strike targets in Syria that they said had been involved in producing chemical weapons, which President Bashar al-Assad’s government denies having used.

Even before the O.P.C.W. inspectors arrived in Syria, the Western allies said they had ample evidence that the country had dropped a chemical agent on Douma, and that it had used chemical weapons many times during the seven-year civil war.

East-West tensions have been high since Britain accused Russia of using a powerful nerve agent to poison a Russian former spy living in England and his daughter. The Kremlin has denied the accusation, which set off the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats and a series of economic measures against Russia.

“It is the style of today’s London to blame Moscow for everything and ascribe certain actions to which we bear no relation whatsoever,” Mr. Ryabkov said.

Russian and Syrian officials have suggested that the chemical attack in Douma never occurred, or that it was staged by rebel forces or Western powers as an excuse for attacking Syria. Mr. Lavrov accused Britain of playing a part in the alleged ruse.

The Syrian military, with help from its Russian and Iranian allies, this month retook control of eastern Ghouta, a suburban area that was the last major rebel-held enclave near Damascus. Douma was the last part of the region to fall.The British delegation to the organization wrote on Twitter: “Russia & Syria have not yet allowed access to Douma. Unfettered access essential. Russia & Syria must cooperate.” Other Western diplomats confirmed that Syria and Russia were impeding the team.

Senior Russian diplomats said it was the United Nations, not Syria or Russia, that had prevented inspectors from entering Douma. “The problem was the absence of the U.N. Secretariat security department’s approval for O.P.C.W. experts to visit Douma,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister of Russia, told reporters, according to the news agency Interfax.

A spokesman for the United Nations, Stéphane Dujarric, disputed the Russian explanation. “The U.N. has given them all the necessary clearances,” he said by telephone. “We’re supporting the team as much as we can.”

Later at his regular noon briefing, Mr. Dujarric said of the O.P.C.W. experts: “We’ve not denied them any sort of clearance.”

Mr. Dujarric declined to say whether Secretary General António Guterres would demand that Russia and Syria provide the experts with access to the Douma site. But the spokesman said Mr. Guterres wanted the investigation to move forward “so we can have a full picture of all the facts.”

The O.P.C.W. declined to comment, and did not even say whether its inspectors had reached Douma, saying in a statement, “We are unable to share operational details.”

The Syrian military, with help from its Russian and Iranian allies, this month retook control of eastern Ghouta, a suburban area that was the last major rebel-held enclave near Damascus. Douma was the last part of the region to fall.“The U.S. mission has not changed — the president has been clear that he wants U.S. forces to come home as quickly as possible,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement Sunday night. “We are determined to completely crush ISIS and create the conditions that will prevent its return. In addition, we expect our regional allies and partners to take greater responsibility both militarily and financially for securing the region.”

The new American sanctions were announced on Sunday by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and the administration’s leading public voice excoriating Russia in recent days. “They will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use,” she said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it.”

Mr. Trump has tried through most of his presidency to forge a friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and has largely avoided criticizing him personally even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigated whether Mr. Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, his administration has taken increasing action against Russia, and the president singled out Mr. Putin over Syria’s use of chemical weapons on Twitter and again in a televised speech on Friday night.

New sanctions on Monday would be the third round enacted by the Trump administration against Russia in the past four weeks. Last month, the administration targeted Russian companies and individuals for intervening in the 2016 election and mounting cyberattacks against Western facilities. It followed that this month with penalties against Mr. Putin’s inner circle, singling out some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials.

The administration also expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain. Russia responded by expelling 60 American diplomats and closing the American Consulate in St. Petersburg.

Mr. Putin spoke with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran on Sunday to discuss the confrontation in Syria and reaffirm his opposition to the airstrike by American, British and French forces. “Vladimir Putin, in particular, stressed that if such actions, carried out in violation of the U.N. Charter, continue, it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,” the Kremlin said in a statement.

America’s allies in Britain and France declared that they were prepared to act again if necessary, but made clear that they did not want to become further involved in Syria. “The rest of the Syrian war must proceed as it will,” Boris Johnson, Britain’s foreign secretary, said on the BBC, adding that the “primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons.”

International inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were in Syria on Sunday to start an investigation of the suspected chemical attack that killed dozens of people in the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7 and prompted the American-led retaliatory strike. American officials have said video and other evidence points to the use of both chlorine and sarin gas by the Syrian government. Russia has asserted that the attack was fabricated to justify military action by the West.

The strikes against Syria were designed to avoid provoking Russia into a response. By hitting just three targets and limiting the attack to a single night, the Trump administration seemed to avoid compelling Moscow to lash back.

But Ms. Haley said the administration was determined to make Moscow pay a price for supporting Mr. Assad, noting that it had vetoed six United Nations resolutions related to Syria and chemical weapons.

“Assad knew that Russia had its back,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Assad knew that Russia would cover for him at the United Nations, and Assad got reckless and he used it in a way that was far more aggressive.”

The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. The Treasury Department, which Ms. Haley said would issue the sanctions, declined to elaborate.

Mr. Trump sought on Sunday to defend his use of “mission accomplished” to characterize the Syria strike, a phrase that evoked memories of President George W. Bush’s visit to an aircraft carrier during the Iraq war that became a symbol of premature victory.

“The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term ‘Mission Accomplished,’” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!”

Advisers said Mr. Trump meant only that the specific mission of hitting three targets in Syria had been carried out, not that the larger goal of thwarting Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons had been met. American officials have acknowledged that the strikes did not eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons capability but expressed confidence that they diminished them and hoped that they would deter Mr. Assad from using them again.

The phrase “mission accomplished” has been freighted since 2003 when Mr. Bush visited the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln after the fall of Saddam Hussein and declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq while appearing before a giant banner emblazoned with the words. Mr. Bush himself never used the phrase, and White House aides later said it was meant to congratulate the carrier crew as it returned home from a long mission, but it became a damaging symbol for Mr. Bush as the war raged on for years.

Critics said Mr. Trump was going too far in claiming success. “It is impossible to say at this point that the mission has been accomplished,” Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine, said on “State of the Union” on CNN. The operation was accomplished “with the precision that our military is capable of,” he added, “but saying that it has been a success, we won’t know until we see whether the regime continues to use chemical weapons.”

Other lawmakers focused on Mr. Trump’s decision to use force without consulting Congress, an issue that has flared under presidents of both parties for decades.

“President Trump is not a king,” Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said on “Face the Nation.” “He’s a president. He’s supposed to come to Congress to seek permission to initiate a war. As Ambassador Haley said, they’ve been following these chemical weapons attacks for months. They clearly had time to come to Congress to seek our permission.”

Still, supporters of Mr. Trump and even some longtime detractors praised him for taking action against the use of chemical weapons without escalating so much that it might draw the United States deeper into Syria’s civil war or provoke a dangerous retaliation.

“I think this administration’s actions against Syria were appropriate,” John O. Brennan, who was C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “And I tend to be a critic of this administration. But I think the way they handled this was exactly right.”Once the guns fall quiet, they say, Syria’s other sizable issues can be addressed: the fight between Turkey and the Kurds in the north; the shadow war between Iran and Israel; and the rebuilding of destroyed communities so that refugees can return.

Ceding that much to Mr. Assad has long been anathema in Washington and other Western capitals, where policymakers believe he should be punished for his brutality during the war and have vowed not to contribute to reconstruction as long as he remains in power.

Some counter that if the West refuses to invest the resources needed to determine Syria’s future, its efforts to penalize Mr. Assad will make life worse for average Syrians.

“You are not punishing Assad, you are punishing the poor Syrian people,” said Joshua Landis, the director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. “If America’s objectives are countering terrorism, stabilization and the return of refugees, all of these will fail.”

President Trump ordered Saturday’s strikes, which were carried out in conjunction with Britain and France, to punish Mr. Assad for an apparent chemical attack in Douma a week before.

The strikes were not intended to topple Mr. Assad, damage the Russian and Iranian allies that support his troops, or protect civilians from violence. In fact, they were meticulously planned and executed to avoid altering the overall dynamics of the conflict and keep the United States from getting dragged further in.

That frustrated Mr. Assad’s foes.

“The American strikes did not change anything for Syrians,” said Osama Shoghari, an anti-government activist from Douma who is struggling to start a new life in an unfamiliar town 180 miles away from his home. “They did not change anything on the ground.”

The West’s resistance to further intervention is good news for Russia and Iran, and of course for Mr. Assad, who was happy on Sunday, according to a group of Russian politicians who visited him.

“President Assad has an absolutely positive attitude, a good mood,” said Natalya Komarova, a member of the delegation, according to Russian news agencies.

But in an acknowledgment of the war’s toll, another visitor reported that Mr. Assad said rebuilding Syria could cost $400 billion.

If the primary message of the strikes was that Mr. Assad could not use chemical weapons, a secondary message was that the West was going to leave him in power, no matter what else he did.

“Even if this is a chemical weapons deterrent, that leaves a whole arsenal of conventional means with which people can be killed in Syria with few real repercussions,” said Sam Heller, a senior analyst who studies Syria at the International Crisis Group. “There is every reason to expect that that will continue.”

Seven years of conflict have seen Syria sliced up by world powers, with the Turks administering towns in the north, the United States working with Kurdish-led militias in the east, and Russia and Iran helping Mr. Assad rout the remaining pockets of rebels elsewhere.

At this point, no one seems to have a realistic plan to broker a lasting peace between those forces that would bring Syria together again in a stable enough way to allow millions of refugees to return home and for rebuilding to begin. Many discount the idea that Mr. Assad can play a meaningful role in that process.

“It is very shortsighted and erroneous in my mind,” said Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “Facilitating a win for Assad is making sure that Syria remains the epicenter of instability in the region.”

Research by the center has found that if Mr. Assad remains in power, it would discourage the return of Syrian refugees from neighboring countries and Europe. “They are not going back as long as Assad is in power because they don’t believe that there will be safety and stability while Assad is there,” Ms. Yahya said.

The only solution, she said, is a settlement between Russia and the United States that other powers, like Turkey and Iran, could eventually be brought into. But reaching such an agreement would involve an intensity of diplomatic efforts that Mr. Trump’s administration is not interested in.

After announcing Saturday’s strikes, Mr. Trump painted a pessimistic view of the United States’ ability to effect change in the Middle East.

“No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East,” he said. “It’s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place.”

He suggested that Arab allies could play an increased role, mentioning Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar. But the first two are bogged down in a war in Yemen, and the first three are locked in a bitter dispute with the fourth, making it unclear how they would work together to fix Syria.

Before the strikes, Mr. Trump froze $200 million in stabilization aid for Syria and said that he wanted to bring home the roughly 2,000 American troops now in eastern Syria.

Besides working with a Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces to fight the Islamic State, the United States is helping restore areas like the city of Raqqa that were recently retaken from the jihadists.

Given the tremendous damage to the city, this is a gargantuan task, said Mustafa al-Abed, of the Raqqa Civil Council, which is supported by the United States. Among his group’s priorities are fixing the water and electricity networks, clearing rubble from roads and restoring irrigation networks so that farmers can plant.

But before that can happen, and before residents can return to their homes, the city must be cleared of the many mines and explosive booby traps that the jihadists planted before their defeat.

“They are everywhere,” Mr. Abed said of the mines. “In homes, in cars, in roads. There is no normal size or place. They are everywhere.”

He was dismissive of Saturday’s strikes, which he said were preceded by so many threats from Mr. Trump that the Syrian government had ample time to evacuate buildings and hide sensitive materials.

“They have used all kinds of weapons,” he said, of the Syrian government’s forces. “So the strikes should have been strong enough to break the back of the regime.”

The only thing that was preventing the government, Russia and Iran from returning to his part of the country was the presence of American troops, he said. He feared what would happen if the United States left.

“We will go back to being a region of struggles, like we were before,” he said. “We’ll return to fighting and fear and blood.”On Monday, the prosecutors in the case will be back in court as a federal judge weighs a request by Mr. Cohen to keep investigators from reviewing the materials they gathered during searches of his office, home and hotel room as part of the inquiry.

It is one of the most consequential corruption inquiries in a generation, notable even by the standards of the Southern District office, which has never been shy about reaching far beyond Manhattan to find headline-grabbing cases. And the office’s longstanding reputation for nonpartisanship and autonomy — it is jokingly referred to as the “Sovereign District” — could make it less vulnerable to attacks from either the president’s allies or his critics.

“The office has been historically known for its independence of the Justice Department,” said John S. Martin Jr., a former United States attorney in Manhattan and former federal judge. “That’s what makes it so powerful in this investigation, and such a danger to Donald Trump.”

The potential threat is not lost on the White House. Mr. Trump’s advisers now view the investigation into Mr. Cohen as more imminent a problem for the Trump presidency than the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, The New York Times reported on Friday.

President Trump has called the F.B.I. raid “a disgraceful situation” and a “total witch hunt.”

The materials seized from Mr. Cohen could open a window into the president’s relationship with a loyal aide who guided Mr. Trump through not only business dilemmas but personal and political ones as well. That includes Mr. Cohen’s role in helping to arrange payments during the campaign to women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump.

In federal court hearings in Manhattan on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump argued that many of the records seized by the F.B.I. were protected by attorney-client privilege. Mr. Cohen has asked for an order temporarily prohibiting prosecutors from reading the documents until the matter could be litigated.

Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, has said the search was “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” A spokesman for the United States attorney for the Southern District declined to comment.

Mr. Berman is not known to have any connection to Mr. Cohen. A former Southern District prosecutor, Mr. Berman is a registered Republican, donated $2,700 to the Trump campaign and did some part-time volunteer work for Mr. Trump’s transition team.

Although Mr. Berman had been law partners with Rudolph W. Giuliani, another former Southern District United States attorney and one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal supporters, that connection was not a factor in the recusal, according to the people briefed on the matter.

Also not a factor in the recusal, one person said, was the personal interview that Mr. Trump conducted with Mr. Berman last year as part of the selection process. Mr. Berman has not disclosed publicly details of any such meeting.

With Mr. Berman sidelined, Mr. Khuzami assumed responsibility for the Cohen investigation. Mr. Khuzami is in his second stint in the office, having made a name for himself as a terrorism and financial crimes prosecutor from 1990 to 2002.

He helped secure the conviction of Omar Abdel Rahman, who conspired to blow up New York City landmarks. As an outgrowth of that case, he worked on the investigation of Mr. Abdel Rahman’s lawyer, Lynne Stewart, who had her office and files searched by federal authorities.

After leaving the Southern District, Mr. Khuzami joined Deutsche Bank, where he ultimately became general counsel for the firm’s American arm. But his role as a terrorism prosecutor arose again when he was asked to give the 2004 speech at the Republican National Convention, in which he staunchly defended the Patriot Act and credited President Bush with having “the courage and the wisdom” to seek its passage.

Mr. Khuzami, who grew up in Rochester, is registered as “nonpartisan.” His friends have teased him about his speech, expressing disbelief that he would participate in the convention even though he is not a Republican. Mr. Khuzami responded that he had actually edited out other comments in his speech praising President Bush.

Mr. Khuzami made a donation to John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2007. He also donated to the campaign of John Anderson, who ran for president in 1980 as an independent against Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.

“He’s apolitical, a consummate public servant who plays by the rules,” said Richard Walker, a partner at King & Spalding who was Mr. Khuzami’s boss at Deutsche Bank and is a former S.E.C. enforcement chief himself.

Mr. Khuzami’s experience at Deutsche Bank, President Trump’s largest lender on Wall Street, has generated some blowback from liberal commentators, but that could bolster his credibility with conservatives. Steven M. Cohen, a former Southern District prosecutor who later became the top aide to New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, recalled watching Rachel Maddow, the MSNBC host, lament Mr. Berman’s and Mr. Khuzami’s ties to Deutsche Bank. Recalling the show, Mr. Cohen said it made him think: “Good lord, he has just been inoculated.”

And Mr. Trump’s advisers are not the only ones who recognize the potential dangers posed to the president by the Southern District’s independence. Andrew C. McCarthy, a former Southern District prosecutor who is now a conservative columnist with National Review and has been a harsh critic of Mr. Mueller, wrote a column on Saturday titled “The Real Investigation.”

“President Trump now has real legal peril” because of the Southern District inquiry, Mr. McCarthy declared. “Anyone potentially connected to it should be worried,” he added.

The investigation is not Mr. Khuzami’s first politically sensitive matter. While at the S.E.C. in 2010, he approved an action against Steven Rattner, a well-connected financier who led the Obama administration’s auto industry overhaul.

And in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when the S.E.C. was under fire for not detecting the Madoff scheme, Mr. Khuzami shook up the enforcement division and filed a record number of actions, many of them against companies at the center of the crisis, including Goldman Sachs.

“We handled lots of politically sensitive cases together at the S.E.C., and my experience is he’ll make the right decision based on the right standard for the right reason,” said Lorin Reisner, who was Mr. Khuzami’s deputy at the S.E.C. and later became the head of the criminal division in the Southern District. “He’s an on-the-merits leader,” said Mr. Reisner, now a partner at Paul Weiss in New York.

But Mr. Khuzami also handed out awards to officials who spent years building potentially big cases that they then chose not to file for lack of evidence — sending a message that the agency should not bend to public and political pressure to punish unpopular figures on Wall Street, according to current and former officials. As a result, the agency faced criticism from the left for not charging top Wall Street executives after the crisis. Much to the dismay of critics of Wall Street and even the agency’s chairwoman at the time, Mr. Khuzami sided with investigators in New York who were opposed to charging top Lehman Brothers executives. Judge Jed S. Rakoff once called one of the agency’s settlements under Mr. Khuzami “pocket change.”

After leaving the S.E.C. in early 2013, Mr. Khuzami became a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, which proved to be a lucrative role. He earned about $11 million over the last two years, a significant sum even by the standards of big law partnership shares.

As Mr. Khuzami leads the Cohen investigation, he is being counseled by two senior prosecutors: Audrey Strauss, a prominent New York lawyer whom Mr. Berman brought back to the office as senior counsel; and Lisa Zornberg, the chief of the criminal division.

Ms. Zornberg was named to lead the division in late 2016 by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney under President Obama. Mr. Bharara was among 46 United States attorneys who were asked in March of last year to submit their resignations. While the directive itself was routine, Mr. Trump had initially asked Mr. Bharara to meet with him at Trump Tower and remain in his post.

The corruption unit prosecutor who spoke in court on Friday was Thomas McKay, who previously helped prosecute Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the New York State Senate. Also in the courtroom were Tatiana Martins, who heads the corruption unit, and her deputy, Russell Capone.

Mr. Bharara, appearing on CNN on Sunday, called the members of the government team professionals “who do things by the book.”

The court hearings on Friday also underscored the Southern District’s reputation for catapulting its alumni into powerful jobs in government and the defense bar.

President Trump’s own lawyer at the hearings, Joanna C. Hendon, once worked as a Southern District prosecutor.On Monday, the prosecutors in the case will be back in court as a federal judge weighs a request by Mr. Cohen to keep investigators from reviewing the materials they gathered during searches of his office, home and hotel room as part of the inquiry.

And in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when the S.E.C. was under fire for not detecting the Madoff scheme, Mr. Khuzami shook up the enforcement division and filed a record number of actions, many of them against companies at the center of the crisis, including Goldman Sachs.

“We handled lots of politically sensitive cases together at the S.E.C., and my experience is he’ll make the right decision based on the right standard for the right reason,” said Lorin Reisner, who was Mr. Khuzami’s deputy at the S.E.C. and later became the head of the criminal division in the Southern District. “He’s an on-the-merits leader,” said Mr. Reisner, now a partner at Paul Weiss in New York.

But Mr. Khuzami also handed out awards to officials who spent years building potentially big cases that they then chose not to file for lack of evidence — sending a message that the agency should not bend to public and political pressure to punish unpopular figures on Wall Street, according to current and former officials. As a result, the agency faced criticism from the left for not charging top Wall Street executives after the crisis. Much to the dismay of critics of Wall Street and even the agency’s chairwoman at the time, Mr. Khuzami sided with investigators in New York who were opposed to charging top Lehman Brothers executives. Judge Jed S. Rakoff once called one of the agency’s settlements under Mr. Khuzami “pocket change.”

After leaving the S.E.C. in early 2013, Mr. Khuzami became a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, which proved to be a lucrative role. He earned about $11 million over the last two years, a significant sum even by the standards of big law partnership shares.

As Mr. Khuzami leads the Cohen investigation, he is being counseled by two senior prosecutors: Audrey Strauss, a prominent New York lawyer whom Mr. Berman brought back to the office as senior counsel; and Lisa Zornberg, the chief of the criminal division.

Ms. Zornberg was named to lead the division in late 2016 by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney under President Obama. Mr. Bharara was among 46 United States attorneys who were asked in March of last year to submit their resignations. While the directive itself was routine, Mr. Trump had initially asked Mr. Bharara to meet with him at Trump Tower and remain in his post.

The corruption unit prosecutor who spoke in court on Friday was Thomas McKay, who previously helped prosecute Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the New York State Senate. Also in the courtroom were Tatiana Martins, who heads the corruption unit, and her deputy, Russell Capone.

Mr. Bharara, appearing on CNN on Sunday, called the members of the government team professionals “who do things by the book.”

The court hearings on Friday also underscored the Southern District’s reputation for catapulting its alumni into powerful jobs in government and the defense bar.

President Trump’s own lawyer at the hearings, Joanna C. Hendon, once worked as a Southern District prosecutor.Mr. Cohen’s lawyers have objected to the use of a taint team and, in yet another unusual move, a lawyer for Mr. Trump filed an emergency motion to the court on Sunday night, saying that the president also objected to that “extraordinary measure.” In her motion, the lawyer, Joanna C. Hendon, asked Judge Wood to give the documents to Mr. Cohen first so that she and the president can look at them and decide if any are protected by attorney-client privilege.

The issue before Judge Wood is, at least for now, a relatively narrow one: Who should be the first to read the seized material and thus be in a position to decide if any of them should be excluded from the case and avoid further scrutiny: the taint team, a special master appointed by the court or Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump themselves. It remained unclear on Monday morning if the judge would rule from the bench or issue a written decision at another time.

The documents could shed light on the president’s relationship with a lawyer who has helped navigate some of Mr. Trump’s thorniest personal and business problems. Mr. Cohen served for more than a decade as a trusted fixer and, during the campaign, helped tamp down brewing scandals about women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump.

In a new filing on Monday, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers claimed that agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized more than a dozen electronic devices during the raids, some of which, they added, contained information that had nothing to do with the investigation. The lawyers also acknowledged that Mr. Cohen had once represented Elliot Brody, the deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, who resigned on Friday after reports emerged that Mr. Cohen had helped him make a $1.6 million payment to a former Playboy model who became pregnant during their affair.

Echoing several of Mr. Trump’s supporters, the lawyers also noted in their filing that there was “a growing public debate” about whether criminal and congressional investigations by the government “are being undertaken impartially, free of any political bias or partisan motivation.”

“It is in this climate,” they wrote, “that the government executed an unprecedented search warrant — instead of using its less onerous subpoena power — upon the personal attorney of the president of the United States.”

But Michael S. Ross, a lawyer who specializes in the attorney-client privilege and teaches the subject at both Brooklyn and Cardozo Law School, questioned the legal reasoning by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump’s lawyers, especially when it came to the attorney-client privilege.

“The notion that attorney-client privilege is so sacrosanct that the government cannot review the documents or the court cannot determine these issues is not only antiquated, it’s no longer viable,” Mr. Ross said. “It’s not a common sense argument. The legal community lives with the fact that privilege issues are determined by taint teams or special masters.”“I’ve been treating lung cancer for 25 years now, and I’ve never seen such a big paradigm shift as we’re seeing with immunotherapy,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, Chief of Medical Oncology at the Yale Cancer Center. He was not involved in the pembrolizumab study.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally, causing 1.7 million deaths a year. In the United States, it is expected to kill more than 154,000 people in 2018.

Patients in the study had an advanced stage of non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The immune-activating drug was a checkpoint inhibitor called pembrolizumab, or Keytruda, made by Merck, which paid for the study. The chemotherapy was a drug called pemetrexed, plus either carboplatin or cisplatin.

Dr. Gandhi said chemotherapy alone had only a “modest benefit,” and could add only a few months of life, with most patients surviving about a year or less. The combination treatment is a significant improvement, she said. It is already approved as a first-line treatment for this disease, so it should be covered by health insurers.

She was scheduled to present the results on Monday in Chicago at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, and they were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Other studies presented at the meeting also highlighted advances in immunotherapy against lung cancer, but were at earlier points in the research and less likely to bring about immediate changes in medical practice.

“If you want to see long-term survival, you’ve got to give immunotherapy as soon as possible,” Dr. Herbst said. “Chemotherapy has limitations. Immunotherapy has the ability to cure. I lead the Yale lung team. We have patients on these immunotherapies alive more than eight years.”

Other studies in lung cancer have involved another checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, or Opdivo (made by Bristol-Myers Squibb), which works in a similar way to pembrolizumab. The data are not conclusive, but Dr. Herbst said, “In lung cancer, my suspicion is these drugs are the same, like Coke vs. Pepsi.”

Most patients stay on the drugs for two years, he said. One Yale patient who has survived for eight years took the drug for two years and has remained well ever since. Another had to stop because of side effects after only two or three months, but is still well two years later.

Dr. Herbst offered several theories about why chemotherapy and immunotherapy could work well together. He said that tumor cells were like bags of hidden proteins that, if exposed, the immune system could use as targets to find and attack cancer. By killing some tumor cells, chemotherapy could pop open the bags, release the contents and help immune cells — unleashed by the checkpoint drugs — to identify their prey. It is also possible, he said, that chemotherapy may kill some immune cells that interfere with the cancer-killing action of other parts of the immune system.

Dr. Gandhi’s study included 616 patients with advanced lung cancer, from medical centers in 16 countries. Their tumors lacked certain mutations that would have made them eligible for other, so-called “targeted” treatments. They were picked at random to receive either chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, or chemotherapy plus a placebo, with two thirds receiving the combination that included immunotherapy.

After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, those in the immunotherapy group were half as likely to die. The median overall survival was 11.3 months in those who did not receive immunotherapy, whereas survival in the immunotherapy group was longer and the median has not yet been reached.

But patients in the immunotherapy group had more kidney problems, more immune-related adverse events and were more likely to stop treatment because of side effects.

The estimated survival at 12 months was 69.2 percent in the group that received immunotherapy, and 49.4 percent in those who did not.

“I think we were all surprised at the magnitude of benefit and how clear the difference was at an early analysis, and that we could tell there was an overall survival difference,” Dr. Gandhi said, adding that there was “a lot of excitement” at the conference about her study and several others involving immunotherapy.

“It represents a sea change in the way we think about treating lung cancer,” she said. “All of it is better than what we’ve been using for years. Going forward, it will only get better.”

Patients were tested for a biomarker used to predict whether pembrolizumab is likely to help them. The drug alone is already approved to treat patients with high levels of those markers. But this study included patients with varying levels. Those with high levels of the marker fared somewhat better with immunotherapy than those with low levels — but even those with low levels were helped.

“The data are impressive,” Dr. Herbst said. “We’re making progress, but still only benefiting 30 to 40 percent of patients. There’s a lot more room to do better. We have to keep looking for new things and new approaches.”“I’ve been treating lung cancer for 25 years now, and I’ve never seen such a big paradigm shift as we’re seeing with immunotherapy,” said Dr. Roy Herbst, Chief of Medical Oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.

We have to keep looking for new things and new approaches.”Defense lawyers say that federal officials, who relied on a paid informant who infiltrated the group, have overstepped by trying to criminalize offensive but legal speech. The lawyers argued that the men’s conversations, many of them secretly recorded by the informant and played for the jurors, amounted to idle talk. No one was physically injured in Garden City.

The trial comes at a time when threats against religious and racial minorities, particularly Muslims, and incidents of hate-related violence have escalated nationally, according to the F.B.I. and organizations that monitor hate crimes. Mosques have been firebombed; women and men in head coverings have been assaulted; and businesses and homes have been vandalized. In some cases, people have been killed.



“It is now approaching the level of hate violence against the same communities that we saw in the immediate wake of the 9/11 attacks,” said Suman Raghunathan, executive director of SAALT: South Asian Americans Leading Together, a national advocacy organization. In the 12 months following the presidential election in November 2016, there were 213 reported incidents of hate violence targeted at Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, South Asian and Middle Eastern people, a 64 percent increase from the previous 12 months, according to a study compiled by SAALT.

Kansas in particular has seen a series of hate-motivated crimes in recent years. In 2014, a white supremacist killed three people outside Jewish centers in Overland Park. And last year, a man fatally shot one Indian immigrant and wounded another at a restaurant in Olathe after shouting, “Get out of my country.”

From the beginning, the Garden City case has been intertwined with politics. The men were arrested less than four weeks before the 2016 election, and prosecutors say they had planned to carry out the bombing on Nov. 9, the day after voters selected a new president.

Kansans voted overwhelmingly for Donald J. Trump, and defense lawyers sought to pick a jury from counties where high percentages of people voted for him. The lawyers said the case was “uniquely political” and that they wanted a pool with more rural, conservative jurors.

The defendants chose not to testify during the trial, but sat quietly in sport coats, ties and leg shackles as prosecutors showed the mostly white jury the rambling handwritten manifesto. The document contained alarming messages, but also listed grievances that sounded common, and well within the conservative mainstream: Border security was too weak, it said. Jobs had moved overseas. The Obama administration had overreached.

At one point, Melody Brannon, a lawyer for Mr. Allen, even alluded to Mr. Trump’s campaign slogan, suggesting that the manifesto called for “coming together as a nation, making America great again.”

“All of those statements reflect the political talk in 2016,” Ms. Brannon, Kansas’ federal public defender, said of the manifesto. “There is nothing in that document that is outside the political talk going on.”

But prosecutors portrayed the militia group’s views as anything but ordinary. The men, they said, were alarmed by growing populations of Muslim immigrants in places like Garden City and were willing to use violence to force them out.

“He’s talked about killing Muslims, even babies,” Special Agent Amy Kuhn, who led the domestic terrorism investigation for the F.B.I., said of Mr. Stein, one of the men on trial.

Garden City, population 26,700, is an increasingly diverse place where Hispanics comprise nearly half the population and a growing number of residents come from places like Somalia, Myanmar, Mexico and Sudan. It is also a Republican stronghold: Mr. Trump carried Garden City’s county by a 31-point margin, and he won more than 80 percent of the vote in some adjacent counties.

As the 2016 presidential race ramped up, Agent Kuhn said, the vitriol in the militia group increased. At various points, the men considered attacks on Mr. Obama, members of Congress and fellow Kansans who had helped Somalis and Muslims.

Eventually, the men, who each lived about an hour’s drive from Garden City, focused on the Mary Street apartments. They started gathering supplies, making homemade explosives and holding planning meetings, which the F.B.I.’s informant recorded, sometimes with country music playing in the background, the agent said.

“The risk was that the defendants would carry out their plan and a bunch of people on Mary Street would not be alive,” Agent Kuhn said.

The apartment complex the men chose as a target was the hub of Garden City’s small Somali community, and the site of its makeshift mosque. Ifrah Ahmed, 28, a Somali refugee living in Garden City, said residents were shocked and terrified after the arrests were announced.

“Everybody was thinking, ‘Now we have to move again. Now we have to start all over again,’ ” Ms. Ahmed said in an interview.

No such exodus occurred. Ms. Ahmed said other Garden City residents expressed their support after the militia plot was made public. The city’s population of Somalis has actually grown since then, she said, to 350 or more.

“It became a very unifying thing, from people across the political spectrum and the religious spectrum, that we weren’t going to tolerate this,” said the Rev. Denise Pass, a Presbyterian pastor in Garden City who helped organize a candlelight vigil at the Mary Street apartments after the arrests. “And we weren’t going to be frightened, either.”

BOSTON — Teeming rain, strong winds and the coldest temperatures in 30 years upended the Boston Marathon on Monday, contributing to upset finishes, including the victory of Desiree Linden, the first American woman to win the race in 33 years.

The temperature hovered at 38 degrees, and a headwind of 10 miles an hour or more blew in runners’ faces. But the conditions did not stop Linden — at 34, it was her first major marathon win — and Yuki Kawauchi, 31, of Japan, who came from behind to win the men’s race.

Mamitu Daska of Ethiopia had bravely raced away from the lead women’s pack before the halfway mark and led by as much as 30 seconds, running alone in the rain and wind. But Linden and Gladys Chesir of Kenya gradually wore her down, and Linden won in 2 hours 39 minutes 53 seconds.

When her fellow American Shalane Flanagan made a quick stop at a portable toilet about 45 minutes into the race, Linden slowed, apparently to wait for Flanagan and help her rejoin the lead pack when she returned. Flanagan soon tired and wound up seventh.

In 2012, Mr. Zwane and agricultural department officials arrived in Vrede to promote the dairy farm project. Flanked by the council speaker, Roseline Zwane, known as Topsy — who happened to be his wife — and by his longtime ally, Mayor Tlokotsi John Motaung, Mr. Zwane told the crowd about a dairy farm that would empower black farmers and create 150 jobs.

Shortly afterward, his department signed the first of its two dairy farm agreements with a company called Estina.

This was a peculiar choice. Estina was to buy cows for local farmers and process milk at the farm. But the company was headed by a businessman from India who had a background in information technology — not in farming. Yet, importantly, he had long worked for the Guptas.

Despite the project’s sketchy details, Mr. Zwane signed off on it and asked the provincial treasury to start paying Estina, according to an investigation by the National Treasury. Initially, he was overruled by lawyers in Mr. Magashule’s office, who deemed the contract invalid because procurement rules, like a competitive bid, had not been followed.

But that was only a hiccup. The province signed another contract with Estina the following month — this time with the lawyers’ blessing. That agreement stated that Estina would invest just under $20 million in the project and the province would contribute about $30 million over three years. Local farmers, the so-called beneficiaries, would retain 51 percent of the shares.

There was “something fishy” from the start, said Doctor Radebe, who was a councilor for the opposition Democratic Alliance in Vrede. Mr. Zwane and the agricultural officials presented no business plan or budget for the project, but they and the mayor insisted on pressing ahead, Mr. Radebe said.

The local municipality quickly decided to hand over 3,400 hectares, or about 8,400 acres, of land for the dairy farm.

In fact, the municipality was so determined to get the project underway that it compensated four white commercial farmers, who had been leasing the land for about $80,000 a year, in order to prematurely break their leases. Later that year, just before Mr. Zwane and his local choir left for India, on a trip sponsored by a Gupta company, the province leased the farm to Estina — rent-free, for 99 years.

In an interview, Mayor Motaung said, “We had no doubt that the plan will work.”

But the mayor acknowledged that Mr. Zwane presented no detailed plan or document about the proposed dairy farm. Even basic details — like the criteria for selecting the beneficiaries — were missing, the mayor said, acknowledging that his role in the project was now under scrutiny.

The payments to Estina began months later. Court documents show that the province deposited just under $21 million in two Estina bank accounts over three years. Days after every payment, the company transferred the entire sum to other accounts. From there, prosecutors say, the money was withdrawn by individuals and other Gupta-linked companies that had little to do with the farm.

In fact, prosecutors say that only about 1 percent of the money invested by the province actually went into dairy farming. Beyond that, the National Treasury found no evidence that Estina ever invested its own money in the project, despite its obligation to do so.

Emails leaked from a Gupta company server indicate that some of the money was sent to the United Arab Emirates and put into accounts registered to the Guptas. The money then made its way back to South Africa through a maze of bank transfers, according to spreadsheets, logs and an invoice in the email trove.

The emails, amounting to thousands of exchanges, were leaked last year to South African news organizations and an anti-corruption group. It is not known who leaked them, though they soon fanned national outrage at the Gupta family and at Mr. Zuma. The Guptas denied the authenticity of the emails, but some A.N.C. officials included in the correspondence confirmed that they were real.

In one of the emails, Gupta companies paid one another for expenses at a relative’s lavish four-day wedding in 2013, including fireworks, dancers, chocolates and scarves.

In another exchange, KPMG, then an auditor of the Gupta companies, ignored a junior employee’s protest and allowed the Gupta family to write off some of the expenses at the wedding as business costs.

“I have never been to an event like that,” Moses Kgosana, a KPMG executive who attended the wedding, gushed to a Gupta brother in one of the emails, calling it “an event of the millennium.”

The accounting firm has since acknowledged that its actions “fell well short of the quality expected.”

Many of the problems surrounding the dairy farm could have been ignored had the province not tried to tap into a national fund for struggling farmers. The national government initially agreed to give about $4 million to the project on the condition that the province submit, among other things, a list of 100 poor farmers who would benefit from the farm.

When the government found no evidence that local farmers were involved, it sent National Treasury auditors to investigate in 2013. Though Mr. Zwane, sometimes accompanied by his wife, had held meetings to look for beneficiaries, no official list had been drawn.“We were happy,” Mr. Ncongwane said, adding, in hindsight, “although we were happy for a crook.”

In one of the emails, Gupta companies paid one another for expenses at a relative’s lavish four-day wedding in 2013, including fireworks, dancers, chocolates and scarves.

In another exchange, KPMG, then an auditor of the Gupta companies, ignored a junior employee’s protest and allowed the Gupta family to write off some of the expenses at the wedding as business costs.

“I have never been to an event like that,” Moses Kgosana, a KPMG executive who attended the wedding, gushed to a Gupta brother in one of the emails, calling it “an event of the millennium.”

The accounting firm has since acknowledged that its actions “fell well short of the quality expected.”

Many of the problems surrounding the dairy farm could have been ignored had the province not tried to tap into a national fund for struggling farmers. The national government initially agreed to give about $4 million to the project on the condition that the province submit, among other things, a list of 100 poor farmers who would benefit from the farm.

When the government found no evidence that local farmers were involved, it sent National Treasury auditors to investigate in 2013. Though Mr. Zwane, sometimes accompanied by his wife, had held meetings to look for beneficiaries, no official list had been drawn.Peter Lynn, the executive director of the Homeless Services Authority, said temporary beds provided a bridge for people to find permanent housing — either on their own or in housing Los Angeles is building with $1.2 billion authorized by voters in 2016. “The objective is not to shelter everybody, and that’s O.K.,” he said. “It’s not as if we have infinite resources.”

A district is not obligated to build a shelter, and could forfeit its money, though officials argued that was unlikely given the pervasiveness of the problem.

“We have no intention to force projects on any district,” said Matt Szabo, the mayor’s deputy chief of staff. “We are confident that there is sufficient consensus that we need these projects that you will see a lot of progress really quickly.”

Under the plan, city crews will clean up encampments after their occupants have moved to the temporary shelters.

“We’re not trying to say this will take care of the entire homeless population,” said Suzi Emmerling, the mayor’s director of communications. “But we do believe it will make a significant dent.”

“Beyoncé is bigger than Coachella.”

She took the stage in Indio on Saturday night in a two-hour performance that reinvented the festival set, teaching history and sweating the details, our critic wrote in his review.

And she made history as well: A year after canceling because of pregnancy, Beyoncé became the first black woman to headline Coachella.

“Let’s just cut to the chase: There’s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon,” our critic, Jon Caramanica, wrote.

And The Los Angeles Times’s critic called it “one of the most impressive things I’ve seen in 20 years of professional show-going.”

Beyoncé is part of the most female-friendly lineup in Coachella history, The Desert Sun noted. Most of the 167 acts are male, but 38 female solo artists or groups and more than a dozen bands with female members will have performed by the festival’s close this weekend.

But often it was to say thanks for ongoing support or for just being there — like the reader who was inspired to write a friend who had faded from her life, or the reader who got the push she needed to send a note of thanks for a friend’s support after a parent’s death.

The overwhelming feeling that people said they came away with was this: Expressing long-overdue gratitude had a meaningful, positive impact for both sender and receiver.

What We’re Reading

• Too much introspection can kill you.

• 6 yoga poses for those who are deskbound.

• On escaping echo chambers.

• Mentally strong people have formed these 10 habits.

• Teach children creativity, not coding.With a brother on the West Coast and no nieces or nephews to step in, Ms. Peveler has, through her church and several civic activities, developed a surrogate family of friends and neighbors, many of them several decades younger, who keep tabs on her. For added protection, she signed up for a service, EyeOn App, that signals three friends if she does not reply within a half-hour to scheduled alerts on her cellphone.

“Once, I didn’t respond, and everyone called me,” she said. “My next-door neighbor sent her daughter over.”

Although no plan is foolproof, Ms. Peveler said she was as confident as she could be. “I know people would have my back,” she said.

Ms. Peveler is among a growing number of older Americans who are unmarried and childless. By 2030, about 16 percent of women 80 to 84 will be childless, compared with about 12 percent in 2010, according to a 2013 report by AARP.

While Ms. Peveler is trying to control the risks of aging alone, many so-called elder orphans may not fare as well. Older single and childless people are at higher risk than those with children for facing medical problems, cognitive decline and premature death, according to a 2016 study led by Dr. Maria Torroella Carney, chief of geriatric and palliative medicine at the Northwell Health system on Long Island. The study noted that about 22 percent of people 65 and older either are childless or have children who are not in contact.

Adult children typically help elderly parents negotiate housing, social-service and health care options. Without such a fallback, elder orphans can reduce their risks by building their own support structures, Dr. Carney said.

“People who are aging alone need to make plans when they are independent and functional,” she said. “They need to learn about the resources in the community and the appropriate time to start using them.” Those services could include senior-friendly housing and the growing number of home-delivered products and services aimed at the aging-solo market, such as healthy meals and doctors who make house calls, she said.

One of the first steps childless people should take is to hire an elder law lawyer, who can draw up documents that will protect them if they become incapacitated. Childless people typically turn to a friend, a lawyer, clergy, or a niece or nephew to make medical decisions, according to experts. A bank’s trust unit can take on financial tasks, with a friend, a relative or a lawyer monitoring the bank’s decisions.

Christina Lesher, an elder law lawyer in Houston, suggests appointing a “micro board,” which includes the lawyer, the health care and financial agents, an accountant and a geriatric care manager. “The board can step in if a client cannot make decisions,” Ms. Lesher said. The client could assign a network of friends and neighbors to call the lawyer in an emergency or if they notice any cognitive decline.

As for housing, Dr. Carney recommends that people aging alone consider a senior-friendly “congregate living” arrangement. Besides offering a variety of services, such housing can lessen isolation, which her research shows can lead to physical and cognitive decline. If that is not possible, she said, elder orphans should move closer to shopping, medical care, recreation and senior support services.

One housing option with a built-in support system is a continuing care retirement community. Residents usually start in an independent living unit and, depending on the care needed, move to an on-site assisted-living unit or a skilled-nursing facility. Entrance and monthly fees tend to be hefty, however. Typical entry fees range from just over $100,000 to more than $400,000 while monthly services fees can range from $2,000 to $4,000, according to MyLifeSite, which tracks the pricing and financial information of more than 800 C.C.R.C.s.

With no one to oversee their care, elder orphans who want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible could enlist a geriatric care manager, who monitors elderly clients and coordinates care.

In Washington, D.C., clients of Iona Senior Services, for example, can arrange for a care manager to be on call as their health deteriorates, said Deborah Rubenstein, director of consultation, care management and counseling programs. If a client is discharged from a hospital, for example, the care manager, in consultation with the designated health care agent, would arrange for rehabilitation or home care, she said.

“More and more people were coming to us and saying, ‘I’m O.K. now, but I’m realistic enough to know my health status could change,’” Ms. Rubenstein said. Iona charges $150 an hour.

Meanwhile, a growing number of volunteer neighborhood groups are providing both social connections and practical help to older people who are at home alone. More than 200 organizations in the Village to Village Network, including “villages” in the New York area, provide rides to medical appointments, snow removal, home repairs and computer support. Villages in 150 additional neighborhoods are in development. Tax-deductible membership fees can range from $100 to $400.

Entrepreneurs and companies, many nationwide, are moving into the so-called longevity market. On-demand services, accessible by a phone app or a computer, can connect people to personal assistants and food delivery.

“The on-demand marketplace will be the best friend of elder orphans,” said Mary Furlong, a Silicon Valley consultant to companies that cater to seniors.

For example, the ride-hailing service Lyft is working with health care systems and retirement communities to provide rides to nonemergency medical appointments and other destinations. And because financial acuity often declines with age, childless singles can enroll in a service such as EverSafe, which monitors accounts for unusual spending and alerts the client or a trusted advocate of possible fraud.

In-home technology, like medication reminders, also can help people live alone safely longer, experts say. Besides her EyeOn home-monitoring system, Ms. Peveler uses an Amazon Alexa device.

“If I am reading a recipe, I can tell her what to put on a shopping list,” said Ms. Peveler, who has a harder time remembering some details since her mini-strokes. And just for fun, she may tell Alexa “to make cat noises, and one of my cats goes nuts.”

For those aging solo, expanding a social network is essential, according to experts on aging. Two years ago, Carol Marak, who is in her mid-60s and lives alone in Dallas, started the Elder Orphan Facebook Group.

“I wanted a place to feel less lonely and to connect with others in the same situation,” said Ms. Marak, who is also the spokeswoman for SeniorCare.com, a site that provides information on local care options. About 6,500 childless singles, mostly women, are members, she said.

Ms. Marak said she was struck by the number of members who worried about being “isolated and disconnected from the community.” She said she was trying hard to create her own social connections. She moved from a suburban house to a downtown condominium building, where she is making new friends. And she has organized brunches for Dallas members of the Facebook page.

Determined to stay healthy for as long as possible, Ms. Marak said she walks six miles a day and eats mostly vegan meals. “I need to keep stronger because I am totally responsible for myself,” she said.With a brother on the West Coast and no nieces or nephews to step in, Ms. Peveler has, through her church and several civic activities, developed a surrogate family of friends and neighbors, many of them several decades younger, who keep tabs on her.

The building smells old and dank. There are holes in the ceiling, skylights don’t work, the walls need to be painted , I still use a chalk board, but — more important — my students need new desks and computers.

I can’t speak for other school districts, but mine — in Tempe — can’t get new social studies books for students. Young teachers spend more out of their own pockets because they don’t have supplies stockpiled.

My pay is not keeping up with inflation. I have co-workers leaving midyear, or not renewing their contracts, and I work with a lot of older teachers that have maybe five more years in them. I also work with some who retire and return as workers for a private staffing company.As I near retirement age, I realize I will retire at the poverty level.

But last week, on the eve of the inaugural Arab Fashion Week Riyadh, the backdrop was very different: Sandstorms and thunderstorms loomed, and missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen sailed overhead.

That, along with a lot of logistical confusion, meant that the week — another example of the social and economic change sweeping through what has been one of the most conservative countries in the world — did not go as smoothly as planned.

The first official fashion week ever held in Saudi Arabia was, said Marriam Mossalli, a luxury consultant in Jeddah, “an amazing opportunity to shift the disconnect in the minds of outsiders about Saudi women, how they design and how they dress. Women here have been waiting for years for a time to shine.”

Yet it almost didn’t happen, though perhaps not for the reasons you would assume.

Five months in the planning, and organized by the Arab Fashion Council (a nonprofit in Dubai that opened a Riyadh office in December), Arab Fashion Week was originally set to begin on March 25. It was postponed after scores of foreign journalists, buyers and models were unable to obtain visas in time to enter the country last month.RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Fashion week in New York, Paris and Milan can often be a surreal experience, full of towering fantasy, inflated egos and sky-high stilettos. But last week, on the eve of the inaugural Arab Fashion Week Riyadh, the backdrop was very different: Sandstorms and thunderstorms loomed, and missiles fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen sailed overhead.

That, along with a lot of logistical confusion, meant that the week — another example of the social and economic change sweeping through what has been one of the most conservative countries in the world — did not go as smoothly as planned.

The first official fashion week ever held in Saudi Arabia was, said Marriam Mossalli, a luxury consultant in Jeddah, “an amazing opportunity to shift the disconnect in the minds of outsiders about Saudi women, how they design and how they dress. Women here have been waiting for years for a time to shine.”

No battles are deemed more or less important than others.

“Once we introduced the concept of unity and equality, it solved all the problems and prevented the arguments,” said Aryeh Muallem, deputy director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense and head of its Bereaved Families, Commemoration and Heritage department.

Preserving morale is considered critical in a small country where most 18-year-olds are drafted for years of compulsory military service. Last Memorial Day, about 1.5 million Israelis, or roughly one-sixth of the population, visited military cemeteries around the country.

But Israelis cannot even agree on what to call some hostilities, like Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which is criticized by many here as an unjustified “war of choice.” Officially called Operation Peace for Galilee, it is usually referred to as the First Lebanon War.

Mr. Muallem said the memorial was the outcome of a long dialogue with representatives of bereaved families. They presented the state with a challenge, wanting their dead to be remembered individually, on the day they had fallen.

So each inscribed brick has a light beside it, which is illuminated on the personal anniversary. At 11 a.m. every day, a brief remembrance ceremony is held for those killed on that date, as their names and images appear on digital screens mounted on 12 pillars. The screens, and a smartphone app, provide more information about the dead.

The wall begins with rows upon rows of blank white bricks, waiting ominously for more names; the design imposes no limit. The first names a visitor sees are the most recent fatalities, and then the wall spirals back to the 1870s, commemorating the earliest casualties of the Zionist struggle and the soldiers of Zionist militias who fought and died before independence.

“We decided to begin from the end, with what most speaks to us today,” said Michal Kimmel-Eshkolot of Kimmel Eshkolot Architects, which designed the monument. The inscribed bricks are no higher than about six feet from the floor, she said during a recent tour of the site, “so a mother can reach up and touch the name.”

Etan Kimmel, the chief architect of the project, wrote in the brochure that the challenge had been to create a space “in a way that touches everyone, but without imposing a uniform interpretation.”

That is at least partly because the issue of war dead still stirs painful debate in Israel.

When it was announced last month that Miriam Peretz, who lost two sons in combat and who then dedicated herself to Zionist education, was to be awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement, another bereaved mother, Nomi Miller, criticized the choice as a cynical glorification of suffering.

“We, the mothers, are not worthy of any prize,” she wrote in an impassioned Facebook post that elicited thousands of sympathetic reactions. “Our sons’ lives ended forever because our country continues to choose to live by the sword. Fight for peace.”

Before the Memorial Hall, most of Israel’s fallen had been commemorated in museums or monuments established by veterans of particular battles or military corps, or in private memorials scattered around the country. But about 3,000 soldiers were not memorialized anywhere.

The idea for a national monument goes back to 1949, when Israel’s leadership proposed erecting a tomb of the unknown soldier. But the location kept changing, and bereaved relatives had no interest in the idea, arguing that their loved ones were not anonymous, according to Prof. Maoz Azaryahu, director of the Herzl Institute for the Study of Zionism at the University of Haifa, Israel.

“When I go back, the whole story of commemoration here in Israel is about names,” Professor Azaryahu said. In the new hall, “metaphorically, the bricks — the names — are the building material of the whole structure.”

Mount Herzl became the focal point of Israeli memory, with its military cemetery and tombs of the founding fathers.

But the idea for a collective monument was quietly dropped until the 1970s, when a plan was developed to build a museum of war and military heritage and a memorial complex on Mount Eitan, outside Jerusalem.

Committees sat. Architects planned. Large amounts of money were invested. Historians, experts and intellectuals filled files with recommendations.

“The new left wanted it to begin in 1948,” said Udi Lebel, a professor of sociology at Ariel University in the West Bank and at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. “Others wanted it to begin with the Bible and Jericho.”

There were arguments about how to present the consequences of the 1967 war, with some viewing the newly occupied territories as a card for peace negotiations and others as the liberation of Greater Israel. Some wanted the Mount Eitan project to lift morale and encourage service. Others worried about presenting Israel as a militaristic, Sparta-like state.

The debates went on until the 1990s. By then, Israel was signing peace accords with the Palestinians and a treaty with Jordan, and many felt it was not the time to build a war museum.

The push for a memorial resumed in the following decade, finally leading to construction.

“What went up in the end is a place with one function only — to give the names of the fallen,” said Professor Lebel, who specializes in collective memory and the politics of bereavement, adding that even one sentence about how they died could be cause for argument.

“That reflects Israel,” he said. “The only consensus there can be here is empathy for the families and remembering the victims. There is no consensus over the past and we are still living the conflict.”“I was struck by the exceptional magnitude of similarity among friends,” said Carolyn Parkinson, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The results “were more persuasive than I would have thought.” Dr. Parkinson and her colleagues, Thalia Wheatley and Adam M. Kleinbaum of Dartmouth College, reported their results in Nature Communications.

“I think it’s an incredibly ingenious paper,” said Nicholas Christakis, author of “Connected: The Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our World” and a biosociologist at Yale University. “It suggests that friends resemble each other not just superficially, but in the very structures of their brains.”

The findings offer tantalizing evidence for the vague sense we have that friendship is more than shared interests or checking off the right boxes on a Facebook profile. It’s about something we call good chemistry.

“Our results suggest that friends might be similar in how they pay attention to and process the world around them,” Dr. Parkinson said. “That shared processing could make people click more easily and have the sort of seamless social interaction that can feel so rewarding.”

Kevin N. Ochsner, a cognitive neuroscientist at Columbia University who studies social networks, said the new report is “cool,” “provocative” and “raises more questions than it answers.” It could well be picking up traces of “an ineffable shared reality” between friends.

Dr. Ochsner offered his own story as evidence of the primacy of chemistry over mere biography. “My wife-to-be and I were both neuroscientists in the field, we were on dating websites, but we were never matched up,” he said.

“Then we happened to meet as colleagues and in two minutes we knew we had the kind of chemistry that breeds a relationship.”

Dr. Parkinson — who is 31, wears large horn-rimmed glasses and has the wholesome look of a young Sally Field — described herself as introverted but said, “I’ve been fortunate with my friends.”

The new study is part of a surge of scientific interest in the nature, structure and evolution of friendship. Behind the enthusiasm is a virtual Kilimanjaro of demographic evidence that friendlessness can be poisonous, exacting a physical and emotional toll comparable to that of more familiar risk factors like obesity, high blood pressure, unemployment, lack of exercise, smoking cigarettes.

Scientists want to know what, exactly, makes friendship so healthy and social isolation so harmful, and they’re gathering provocative, if not yet definitive, clues.

Dr. Christakis and his co-workers recently demonstrated that people with strong social ties had comparatively low concentrations of fibrinogen, a protein associated with the kind of chronic inflammation thought to be the source of many diseases. Why sociability might help block inflammation remains unclear.

Researchers have also been intrigued by evidence of friendship among nonhuman animals, and not just in obvious candidates like primates, dolphins and elephants.

Gerald G. Carter of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and his colleagues reported last year that female vampire bats cultivate close relationships with unrelated females and will share blood meals with those friends in harsh times — a lifesaving act for animals that can’t survive much more than a day without food.

Through years of tracking the behaviors of a large flock of great tits, Josh A. Firth of Oxford University and his co-workers found that individual birds showed clear preferences for some flock members over others. When a bird’s good friend died or disappeared, the bereft tit began making overtures to other birds to replace the lost comrade.

Yet when it comes to the depth and complexity of bonds, humans have no peers. Dr. Parkinson and her co-workers previously had shown that people are keenly and automatically aware of how all the players in their social sphere fit together, and the scientists wanted to know why some players in a given network are close friends and others mere nodding acquaintances.

Inspired by the research of Uri Hassan of Princeton, they decided to explore subjects’ neural reactions to everyday, naturalistic stimuli — which these days means watching videos.

The researchers started with a defined social network: an entire class of 279 graduate students at an unnamed university widely known among neuroscientists to have been the Dartmouth School of Business.

The students, who all knew one another and in many cases lived in dorms together, were asked to fill out questionnaires. Which of their fellow students did they socialize with — share meals and go to a movie with, invite into their homes? From that survey the researchers mapped out a social network of varying degrees of connectivity: friends, friends of friends, third-degree friends, friends of Kevin Bacon.

The students were then asked to participate in a brain scanning study and 42 agreed. As an fMRI device tracked blood flow in their brains, the students watched a series of video clips of varying lengths, an experience that Dr. Parkinson likened to channel surfing with somebody else in control of the remote.

They watched astronaut Chris Hadfield demonstrate how water behaves like a goopy gel in low gravity. They watched a sedately sentimental scene from a Jewish wedding between two people who happened to be gay men.

They watched the author Eric Schlosser warn of the dangers of allowing a few fast-food giants to control our food supply. They watched what my good friend Judy Gradwohl and I agreed, on reviewing the clips together later, was one of the worst music videos ever produced, about a man with an obviously fake facial deformity who is bullied at work and snubbed by his attractive female colleague but who eventually wins her heart when the bullies turn on her and he, Phony Elephant Man, steps in and beats them up.

The students watched pratfall comedy clips and an Australian mockumentary so subtle that certain viewers confessed they didn’t realize it was a spoof but liked it nonetheless.

Analyzing the scans of the students, Dr. Parkinson and her colleagues found strong concordance between blood flow patterns — a measure of neural activity — and the degree of friendship among the various participants, even after controlling for other factors that might explain similarities in neural responses, like ethnicity, religion or family income.

The researchers identified particularly revealing regions of pattern concordance among friends, notably in the nucleus accumbens, in the lower forebrain, which is key to reward processing, and in the superior parietal lobule, located toward the top and the back of the brain — roughly at the position of a man bun — where the brain decides how to allocate attention to the external environment.

Using the results, the researchers were able to train a computer algorithm to predict, at a rate well above chance, the social distance between two people based on the relative similarity of their neural response patterns.

Dr. Parkinson emphasized that the study was a “first pass, a proof of concept,” and that she and her colleagues still don’t know what the neural response patterns mean: what attitudes, opinions, impulses or mental thumb-twiddling the scans may be detecting.

They plan next to try the experiment in reverse: to scan incoming students who don’t yet know one another and see whether those with the most congruent neural patterns end up becoming good friends.

Alexander Nehamas, a professor of philosophy at Princeton University and author of a meditative book, “On Friendship,” appreciated the design of the study and its use of video clips to ferret out the signature of friendship.

“The aesthetic choices we make, the things we like, the taste we have in art, plays, TV, furniture — when you put them together they are absolutely essential components of our character, an indication of who we are,” he said. We live “immersed in art.”

Not high art, not a night-at-the-opera art, but everyday art — buildings, billboards, clothing, the dishes at a restaurant, the percussive rhythms of subways on train tracks.

“Watching TV clips is much more accurate to our everyday life than the times we go to a museum,” he said, and therefore potentially more revealing of who we are and what we hope to find in a friend.

So if you happened to catch “The Cute Show: Sloths!,” about a self-proclaimed “sloth sanctuary” in Costa Rica, and if your first thought wasn’t ooh, how adorable those little smiley sloths are, but rather, sloths are not pets to be cuddled and don’t bathe the algae off their fur — haven’t you heard of mutualism? — give me a call.

The act of self-immolation was so shocking, the loss so sudden, that friends and family of Mr. Buckel struggled on Sunday to make sense of his legacy, if not his death.

“He was very much someone who felt like he always wanted to make sure that while he was alive that he was doing more to make the world a better place,” his partner of nearly 34 years, Terry Kaelber, said. “And he wanted to give more than he was taking from it.”

Suicide is, ultimately, ineffable, and experts caution that there is a rarely a single reason people take their own lives; they say there are often underlying issues, such as mental illness.

His family and friends acknowledged that Mr. Buckel had become distraught recently over the national politics of climate change — “all that’s going on with the Trump administration and the rollback by Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency,” Mr. Kaelber said, referring to agency’s embattled administrator, Scott Pruitt.

In retrospect, Mr. Morales said he knew Mr. Buckel had been upset as recently as February when he began discussing articles about the environment, for instance one about how 96 percent of human beings breathe polluted air and another about the Arctic Circle experiencing record breaking temperatures.

Mr. Morales said two weeks ago Mr. Buckel sent him an email with all his contacts for the compost site, showing him how to complete paperwork, annual reports and other documents that would need to be turned over to city agencies.

Mr. Buckel was the lead lawyer in the case in which a Nebraska sheriff was found liable for failing to protect a transgender man who was murdered in Falls City, and was the strategist behind same-sex marriage cases in New Jersey and Iowa.

He retired from Lambda Legal in November 2008, and was a grant writer before starting at the composting site at the farm, across from an Ikea store. He felt composting was something that community members could do together to bring about a more sustainable world.

Mr. Buckel lived his message. He took showers with a minimum use of water, and walked one hour to work and back from his home at the edge of Prospect Park, rather than use fossil fuels. He refused even to use machines at the composting site, evidence of a passion that friends say was his true fuel.

“This is the David Buckel that I knew,” said Mr. Martig, 34, who worked with Mr. Buckel at the farm.

“I struggle to believe that this is a protest suicide. I think that, underneath, he’s got to be in a very dark place, it’s not characteristic of David,” he added.

On a grim Sunday, neighbors gathered at Mr. Buckel’s home.

George Bachman, a retired firefighter, would greet him tending his garden on a quiet stretch south of Prospect Park. His 16-year-old daughter knew Mr. Buckel’s college-age daughter, Hannah.

He knew the history of Mr. Buckel’s kind of suicide, but was perplexed. “I’m a Vietnam veteran so I’m well aware,” Mr. Bachman said. “Buddhist monks used to light themselves up in protest of the war.”

Mr. Buckel alluded in his letter to the self-immolation of Tibetans as protest against China’s government.

Tom and Isa Cucinotta of Lefferts Gardens spent a few minutes in silence at the site in Prospect Park where Mr. Buckel died. They did not know him, but they felt a kinship with him and his despair with the current state of the world.

“It feels important because he was one of the people able to do something about these injustices. He was successful, whereas we can only do little things,” Ms. Cucinotta said. “It feels like he has given up.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency violated the law when it installed a $43,000 soundproof phone booth for the administrator, Scott Pruitt, a congressional watchdog agency found.

The Government Accountability Office said in a report on Monday that the E.P.A. was required to notify Congress before spending more than $5,000 on office equipment or decorations.

The E.P.A. said the secure phone booth was necessary “to make and receive phone calls and to discuss sensitive information, including classified telephone calls up to the top secret level.” The agency paid $23,000 for the phone booth and another $25,000 install a drop ceiling, remove closed-circuit television equipment and pour more concrete around the booth, according to agency contracts.

The G.A.O. said it was not taking a position on whether or not the installation of the privacy booth was necessary, but was focusing only on whether the agency violated the Antideficiency Act, which is designed to prevent the spending of money that has not been budgeted. Auditors wrote that the E.P.A.’s “failure to comply with a governmentwide statutory requirement that an agency notify the appropriations committees before it spends more than $5,000 for the office of a presidential appointee” was a violation of the law and should be reported to Congress and the president.

In an eight-page letter to lawmakers, Thomas H. Armstrong, the G.A.O.’s general counsel, said the agency did not send advance notice to Congress when it paid $43,238.68 from its Environmental Programs and Management budget to pay for the installation of the soundproof booth.

BEIJING — Bowing to intense pressure from millions of internet users, a Chinese social media site said on Monday that it would scrap plans to censor cartoons and video games with gay themes.

The site, Sina Weibo, had announced on Friday that it would target gay content as part of a campaign to remove pornographic and violent material from its site.

But its efforts were almost immediately criticized as discriminatory and repressive, spawning an outpouring of #Iamgay hashtags and slogans like “gays aren’t scary.”

On Monday, Weibo said in a post that it would scale back its “cleanup” effort and focus on “pornographic, violent and bloody content” instead of gay material. In a nod to the intense backlash, it thanked internet users for their “discussion and suggestions.”

The company did not say whether it would continue to delete texts, photos and videos with gay themes, which were also listed as targets in the original announcement. Weibo did not respond to a request for comment.But over the last few weeks, leaks of tampered files and previously missing documents are raising sharper questions about whether Mr. Abe helped friends at two educational institutions gain preferential treatment from the government. Mr. Abe has insisted he was not involved in either case and has suggested that bureaucrats may have acted independently.

The drip-drip of revelations has poked holes in Mr. Abe’s credibility as he prepares to meet Mr. Trump, who is himself consumed by his own scandals.

“There has been a lot of new evidence that has come to light that there has been some kind of cover-up,” Kristi Govella, assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said of the inquiry surrounding Mr. Abe. “As time goes on, the disjuncture between what he’s saying and the facts that are coming to light with the scandals just really increase public distrust and feelings that his leadership is no longer what the country needs.”

Until now Mr. Abe has proved relatively invincible in the face of calls by opposition parties to explain himself. Last spring, the scandals embroiled the prime minister in multiple rounds of questioning in Parliament, but the public grew weary of the arcane details of the cases, while both the opposition and the news media failed to produce definitive evidence that Mr. Abe had exerted improper influence.

But last month, the Finance Ministry said an internal investigation found that bureaucrats had tampered with official documents related to the sale of public land to an ultraconservative education group, known as Moritomo Gakuen, at a steeply discounted price. Mr. Abe’s wife, Akie, served as a onetime honorary principal of a planned elementary school that Moritomo wanted to build on the disputed land.

In one of the most damaging findings, the ministry said that officials had scrubbed Mrs. Abe’s name and alleged remarks encouraging the deal from the documents when they were first submitted to Parliament, known in Japan as the Diet. Then this month Mitsuru Ota, a senior official at the Finance Ministry, told Parliament that a bureaucrat had urged a lawyer for Moritomo to lie about how much it would cost to remove garbage from the public land in order to justify the sale at a discounted price.

Last week, the newspaper The Asahi Shimbun reported the existence of a memo in a separate scandal showing that Mr. Abe had talked over a meal to a friend seeking to set up a veterinary school in a special economic zone in southwestern Japan. The memo also suggested that a secretary for Mr. Abe had helped the friend set up the veterinary school.

None of the leaks have yet proven Mr. Abe’s involvement.

“There’s still nothing to say that Abe ordered the cover-up” or pushed for his friend’s veterinary school deal, said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a political risk consultancy based in New York. “But between the Finance Ministry falsifying documents submitted to the Diet and the bureaucracy making up documents, those are things that are not just going to be accepted passively by the public.”

Mr. Abe “is running out of time, and there doesn’t really seem to be a way out of this,” Mr. Harris said.

For the five years that Mr. Abe has been in power, he has benefited from a weak opposition and public weariness over the revolving door at the prime minister’s office that preceded his election in 2012. And as Japan has faced increasing threats from China and North Korea, he has been able to persuade voters that he is the best leader to keep Japan secure. The economy has been gradually improving, too.

With the scandals gaining traction, however, that formula is weakening. “For the last five years we have had some consensus that Japan needs a strong leader and we have to sustain that strong leader,” said Ryo Sahashi, a professor of international politics at Kanagawa University. “But I think that consensus is now eroded.”

If Mr. Abe is able to hold on to power, it may be public fatigue that helps him. Norimasa Araki, 76, a retired trading company employee who was having lunch near Shimbashi Station in central Tokyo on Monday, said that the scandals were “not worth paying attention to.”

“The problems are trivial,” he added.

Still, there is no question that Mr. Abe has been politically weakened even if he secures a third term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in September.

Mr. Sahashi said it would be much more difficult for Mr. Abe to push through some of his most cherished agendas, including revising the country’s pacifist Constitution.

As Mr. Abe flies to Florida for his sixth meeting with Mr. Trump since the American election, he will be looking to make sure Japan’s security is not inadvertently compromised in any Trump-Kim discussions.

Mr. Abe is also likely to urge Mr. Trump to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the regional trade deal that Mr. Trump pulled out of during his first week in office and last week said he would reconsider.

“A big handshake with a U.S. president about trade liberalization is a chance for Prime Minister Abe to reclaim his ground as a reformer to the Japanese public,” said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors. “It is a good opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to show the public that he is a strong leader in foreign policy.”

Even if he can claim some kind of victory in his meeting with Mr. Trump, it is unclear whether it will help him. “Even now the vultures are starting to circle,” Ms. Govella said. “People are trying to figure out what comes next after Abe.”Sea turtles use the earth’s magnetic fields to navigate back to the area where they were born decades earlier, according to a new study that used loggerhead genetics to investigate their travels.

After swimming for years in a giant loop from nesting grounds in North Carolina and Florida to North Africa, the turtles find their way back to nest on beaches within about 40 to 50 miles of where they were born. The new study suggests that the turtles learned their home beach’s distinctive magnetic signature, through what is called geomagnetic imprinting.

“This is vital information if you want to restore sea turtles to areas where they once lived before being hunted to extinction,” said Kenneth Lohmann, a professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and senior author of the study published Thursday in Current Biology.

He added that the same concepts may be applicable for restoring salmon and other fish to rivers because many birds and fish also use magnetic fields for navigation.“There isn’t a bubble around the classical world, no hard and fast lines separating one culture from another,” said Mr. Potts, noting that Alexander the Great’s conquests included Central Asia, and that the Roman Empire extended as far as Afghanistan.

He was giving a tour of a new gallery called “The Classical World in Context,” which makes its grand debut along with the permanent-collection reinstall. This gallery relies on long-term loans from other institutions to help broaden the Getty’s horizons.

He pointed out prime examples of first- to third-century funerary relief portraits from Palmyra, the ancient caravan city in the Syrian desert, borrowed from the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen.

“The destruction in Syria today makes the exhibition even more topical, but we didn’t choose this material for that reason,” Mr. Potts said. Rather, he added, he was interested in how these Syrian objects blend an array of cultural influences.

“Since Palmyra was on the borderland region between the fringe of the Roman Empire and the Parthian empire, the art reflects the coming together of two traditions,” he said, pointing out the Roman drapery on the limestone objects.

Here are five highlights of the re-envisioned Villa, not to be missed. Some are old favorites in new contexts. One comes fresh from long-term storage.

But one very prominent statue is no longer on view: the Getty Kouros, a larger-than-life sculpture of a naked young man once thought by museum leaders to be from ancient Greece. Soon after its purchase in 1985, scholars and scientists publicly doubted its authenticity. It was recently on view at the Villa, labeled “Greek, about 530 B.C. or modern forgery.” Mr. Potts is not waffling. “It’s fake, so it’s not helpful to show it along with authentic material,” he said. It will be accessible by appointment.

“The Beauty of Palmyra,” 190-210 A.D.

Photo

Though time has stripped the statues’ color away, scholars now know that many classical Greek and Roman sculptures were originally not white but as vivid as contemporary works by Jeff Koons or Takashi Murakami. You can see evidence of this polychromy painting technique in the showstopper known as “The Beauty of Palmyra,” a limestone funerary sculpture. This heavily bejeweled female figure with Eastern headdress still has flecks of red in her hair and on her cheeks, with gold tints on her pendant necklaces. Kenneth Lapatin, the Getty’s associate antiquities curator, considers her a masterpiece “both for the high quality of the carving and for the preservation of all the polychromy.”

Statue of a Victorious Youth (the Getty Bronze), 300-100 B.C.

Ancient bronzes are exceedingly rare today because the metal was so valuable it was often melted down. But this sculpture, modeled in the style of Lysippos, was preserved by a cosmic accident: a shipwreck in the Adriatic Sea kept it submerged until 1964. Its modeling is powerful, its casting is expert, and the subject of the athletic youth has an illustrious lineage culminating in Michelangelo’s David. The sculpture has been the subject of protracted legal challenges from Italy, which has claimed the work because it was discovered by an Italian fishing trawler and brought back to Italian soil. The Getty has maintained that the piece was found in international waters and its own acquisition was legal. Asked about the status of the court battles, Mr. Potts did not have an update or resolution: “It just goes around the courts,” he said.

Caeretan Hydria (Water Jar) With Herakles and Iolaos Attacking the Hydra, 525 B.C.

The drama comes straight from Greek mythology: Herakles is poised to smash one snakelike head of the hydra, while Iolaos holds a sickle to another. But the style of the vase is not traditionally Greek: The strange lozenge pattern on the rim, the stars right below it, and even the squared-off shape of the rim are typical of pottery from Etruria, in what is now central Italy. “It’s a Greek myth rendered in a way that’s unmistakably Etruscan,” Mr. Potts said. He praised the vase as one of the prized pieces in the collection, now on view with other Etruscan works: “It’s got everything you want a great vase painting to have: great subject matter, beautifully executed and distinctive local style.”

Frescoes From Villa Numerius Popidius Florus at Boscoreale, 1-79 A.D.

From its gardens to its architecture, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades was modeled on the Villa dei Papiri, a Roman seaside estate that was preserved by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. One new goal in the reinstall, Mr. Potts said, is to create a few moments where you can see what a great ancient estate like this might have contained. For example the walls would not have been painted a cool gray, as they are now, but covered in frescoes, with decorative flourishes and narrative details. These four frescoes fit the bill — they came from another Roman villa active during roughly the same period and were in Getty storage for years. One has a narrative element, but the identity of the figures is a mystery: Some speculate that it’s Socrates and his teacher Diotima. Others, judging by the man’s bare feet and unkempt look, say he is probably a Cynic philosopher, perhaps Diogenes.

Roman Statue of Draped Figure, 160-190 A.D.

If you visit this seven-foot-tall female figure, see if you can detect the break in her neck. When the Getty acquired the work in 1972, the head was missing — the sculpture consisted of a body covered in flowing drapery. But two years ago, after seeing a photograph of the intact sculpture during research for the reinstall, Jeffrey Spier, the Getty Museum’s senior curator of antiquities, immediately recognized an object on view at the Royal-Athena Galleries in New York as the missing head.

“I was at the gallery looking at something else Tim was interested in, and I turned around to see the head just sitting there,” he recalled. “I almost laughed, it was so perfect.” The museum acquired it and turned it over to conservators, who have worked to rejoin it to its body and fill the crack. “We had to come up with a new word for it: recapitation,” Mr. Spier offered, laughing. He never learned why the head was severed, but suspects it was easier to transport and sell on its own.With public housing racially isolated, other policies — some misguided but well intentioned, others indefensible — exacerbated the dysfunction. Austen notes that long waiting lists for relatively few units left poor applicants without other options for safe lodging. Compassionate officials addressed the predicament by lowering the income cutoff to qualify for public housing. The Chicago Housing Authority then made space for the poor by evicting working-class families for whom the projects were initially designed. The authority’s executive director told them, “Be proud to move out, so that a lower-income family can have the advantage that you have had.” Public housing’s opponents also demanded the evictions, insisting that those able to afford private accommodations should be barred from public support.

As Austen observes, the policy created a disincentive to marry, because a husband’s wages might render a family ineligible to remain in its home. The result was the segregation of projects by race and by income, concentrating fatherless young men who not only had little access to legitimate employment but lacked working-class role models who knew how to search for it. In the early 1950s, the median income of Chicago’s public housing residents was nearly two-thirds of the citywide average. By 1970, it was barely one-third.

Initially, Cabrini-Green hired residents as maintenance workers. But perversely, when income cutoffs were lowered, holding such jobs made tenants ineligible to remain. With residents themselves no longer responsible for maintenance, projects deteriorated. And with projects now filled with the politically powerless, and with revenue from rent payments falling, government slashed maintenance budgets and turned high rises into slums. In 1977, Cabrini-Green had 19 maintenance workers; two years later, there were six. Nearly half its units were unoccupied because of insufficient staff. Yet for most who remained in the projects, conditions were still superior to those in the overcrowded dwellings from which they had come.

Meanwhile, industry departed the Cabrini-Green neighborhood, leaving young men with few lawful ways to earn a living. The efforts of public officials to provide job training and transportation that might have mitigated their plights were minimal and episodic.

Austen supplements his account of these policy failures with interviews with former Cabrini-Green residents. They are mostly community leaders, but their stories can’t skirt the drug dealing, gang wars and homicides that dominated Cabrini-Green’s public image. The police response ranged from rare attempts at community monitoring (difficult, at best, when officers had to roam 19 stories) to unprovoked brutality and even torture — a reflection of law enforcement’s general contempt for the civil rights of law-abiding residents, as well as a fundamental lack of concern for their safety. Chicago’s police superintendent acknowledged that his officers walked a “very fine line between maintaining order and becoming oppressive.”

“High-Risers” concludes by recounting the resolve of Chicago elites, in the last decade or so, to reclaim the Cabrini-Green property, so close to downtown, for condo owners and their upscale services. Gentrification was only slightly hindered by the residents’ reluctance to vacate their apartments, out of the well-founded fear that the alternatives might be no better. The project’s reputation as a violent wasteland made this resistance easy for civic leaders to overcome.

The last of Cabrini-Green’s 15 towers was demolished in 2011. In their place, Chicago subsidized middle-class residences, with a promise that 40 percent of units would be reserved as public housing for the project’s former occupants. But that pledge was abandoned, as was one to relocate tenants to decent housing elsewhere. Most of the African-Americans who called Cabrini-Green home are now in less adequate (and frequently just as dangerous) homes in new, still segregated neighborhoods.

The alternatives Paul Douglas faced — either segregated housing or none at all — were not the only possibilities. We as a society could have dispersed low-income families across less dense public projects throughout metropolitan areas. We could have preserved diversity of income and race; many working-class white families, especially returning war veterans, needed apartments in the 1950s and would have preferred heterogenous housing developments to living with their in-laws. Many employed white veterans did initially live in public housing, only to abandon it for single-family homes in racially restricted suburbs, thanks to attractive federal mortgage terms.

In an otherwise nuanced book, Austen labels the social workers and officials who vowed to clear slums and house the poor as “do-gooders.” Implicit in his scorn is a hindsight appreciation that, for the poor to thrive, their communities must include working- and even middle-class families. The urbanist Jane Jacobs knew as much, but her “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” was published in 1961, after evictions of working-class public housing residents were already well underway. Until the sociologist William Julius Wilson published “The Truly Disadvantaged,” in 1987, few comprehended the terrible consequences of cleansing urban neighborhoods of the stably employed. In 2018, Ben Austen has illustrated these repercussions; we can now better consider remedies by contemplating the lessons “High-Risers” offers.After consultation, the Conservative government has modified its 2015 pre-election pledge to implement a total ban on ivory sales. The proposed legislation has, nonetheless, thrown the British antiques industry into a spin.

“We can trade at the top end, but for someone starting out or people in the middle market, this is a total disaster,” said Jan Finch, partner at Finch & Co., a London based dealership specializing in unusual objects from around the world. Ivory pieces frequently appear in its stock.

Like many in the British art and antiques trade, Ms. Finch thinks the 10 percent maximum for ivory-decorated antiques is too low and would like to know how the criterion “rarest and most important” will, in practice, be applied.

“A whole load of stuff will be illegal,” Ms. Finch added, referring to everyday items such as boxes and chess sets that will soon be unsellable and unexportable.

But where, exactly, will the “top end” of the remaining trade in antique ivory be pitched? How many of those relatively humble Japanese netsuke carvings, for example, will pass the “rarest and most important” test?

The Animal and Plant Health Agency “could decide to establish a bar that’s too high,” said Max Rutherston, a leading specialist dealer in netsuke, based in London. “If I’m offered a great piece, how do I know it’s going to get a sales permit?”

Mr. Rutherston currently has 155 ivory netsukes in stock, 130 of which are being offered on behalf of clients. Prices range from about 250 pounds, or about $350, to £45,000, the level at which he currently values Mr. de Waal’s “Hare With Amber Eyes.”

Uncertain of how much of his stock will be eligible for government-issued sales permits, Mr. Rutherston said he is considering relocating his business to continental Europe, perhaps to the Netherlands.

But dealers in the European Union, who can trade in worked ivory dating from before 1947, courtesy of an exemption in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also have problems with this controversial stock-in-trade.

“It’s much more difficult to sell ivory,” said Florian Eitle-Böhler, director of the old master sculpture dealers Julius Böhler Kunsthandlung, based in Starnberg, Germany. “I’ve reduced prices by about 50 percent in the last five years,” said Mr. Eitle-Böhler, who exhibited an exceptional pair of 17th-century ivory reliefs, “Bathsheba at her Bath” and “Lot and his Daughters,” attributed to Francis van Bossuit, at last month’s Tefaf fair in Maastricht, priced at 250,000 euros, or around $310,000. He said his gallery did not sell any ivory pieces at the fair.

Mr. Eitle-Böhler, echoing other British and European dealers, said one of the main problems was the ending of the trans-Atlantic trade in ivory. “You can’t sell to America,” he said. “You commit a felony. It gets destroyed.”

But New York’s status as a no-go zone for trading in antique ivory is being challenged by dealers in the United States. In a complaint filed on April 5 to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Art and Antique Dealers League of America and the National Art and Antiques Dealers Association of America are contesting the New York state law passed in 2014 banning the sale of antique ivory. The plaintiffs contest that this state legislation conflicts with exemptions for antiques included in prevailing federal ban on the ivory trade.

Back here in Britain, the window for buying and selling antique ivory is closing.

“We are turning things away,” said Lee Young, managing director of Duke’s, an auction house in Dorchester, England. “We’re not going to be able sell something that could be worthless in six months’ time.”

Mr. Young, a specialist in Asian art, said there could well come a point when Duke’s, along with other British-based auction houses, would no longer sell ivory.

“The trade will die because people will be too embarrassed to own these things,” Mr. Young said. But what will happen to the mountain of unsellable, unexportable ivory antiques that will then accumulate in Britain? “You’ll only be able to pass it down the generations, and they won’t want it,” he added.

The “Hare With Amber Eyes,” a signed piece by the Osaka carver Masatoshi, dating from around 1880, would doubtless pass the “rarest and most important” test, thanks to the popular success of Mr. de Waal’s book. But what about all the other, less exceptional ivory netsuke in this family collection? When Britain’s ban on its ivory trade becomes law, these too could become unsellable and, in a sense, worthless. Mr. de Waal declined a request from The New York Times for comment.

If — and in dealers’ minds, this remains a huge “if” — elephants can be saved by banning the trade in antique ivory, this would be a story with a happy ending. But a lot of other stories will be lost along the way.“This great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes,” declared Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican. “But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up.”

No, Mr. Hatch wasn’t talking about Donald Trump. It was 1999, and he was talking about Bill Clinton.

At that time, the American system — and the flawed yet sometimes heroic people their fellow Americans choose to lead them — underwent, and passed, a hard test: The president, his financial dealings and his personal relationships were painstakingly investigated for years. Prosecutors ultimately accused Mr. Clinton of lying under oath, to cover up a sexual affair. The House of Representatives impeached him, but the Senate declined to convict, and Mr. Clinton stayed in office.

The public, which learned in detail about everything investigators believed Mr. Clinton had done wrong, overwhelmingly agreed with the judgment of the Senate. It was a sad and sordid and at times distracting business, but the system worked.

Now Mr. Hatch and his fellow lawmakers may be approaching a harsher and more consequential test. We quote his words not to level some sort of accusation of hypocrisy, but to remind us all of what is at stake.

News reports point to a growing possibility that President Trump may act to cripple or shut down an investigation by the nation’s top law-enforcement agencies into his campaign and administration. Lawmakers need to be preparing now for that possibility because if and when it comes to pass, they will suddenly find themselves on the edge of an abyss, with the Constitution in their hands.

[Keep up with the state of the national debate right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]

Make no mistake: If Mr. Trump takes such drastic action, he will be striking at the foundation of the American government, attempting to set a precedent that a president, alone among American citizens, is above the law. What can seem now like a political sideshow will instantly become a constitutional crisis, and history will come calling for Mr. Hatch and his colleagues.

For months, investigators have been examining whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with the Russian government to undermine American democracy, and whether the president misused his power by obstructing justice in an effort to end that investigation.

Until the last few weeks, Mr. Trump had shown restraint, by his standards, anyway. He and his lawyers cooperated with investigators. Mr. Trump never tweeted directly about Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and spoke about him publicly only when asked.

Alas, that whiff of higher executive function is gone. Mr. Trump is openly attacking both Mr. Mueller and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed by Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Rosenstein is overseeing the Russia investigation and signing off on Mr. Mueller’s actions.

Of course, this president has been known to huff and puff, to bluff and bluster, and he may be doing no more than that now. He may choose not to fire either man. We know he has already twice told his aides he wanted Mr. Mueller fired, only to be talked out of such rash action.

But if the president does move against the investigators, it will be up to Congress to affirm the rule of law, the separation of powers and the American constitutional order. The miserable polarization and partisan anger that have been rising in American life for decades will hit a new crescendo, and that will present congressional Republicans with a heavy burden indeed.

Mr. Trump’s Tweets on the Rule of Law

Yet if Mr. Trump goes after Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosenstein, even Republicans who have misgivings about the president might be inclined to fall into line. They may resent what feels like an endless investigation, one that is endangering their agenda; or they may resent partisan attacks on Mr. Trump. Such frustrations — like ones Democrats vented when Mr. Clinton was in investigators’ sights — are certainly understandable. Republicans may also find themselves tempted by the political running room they would have with the investigation ended and the three branches of government under their control.

Maybe — and this is the scariest contingency to contemplate — Republican leaders would calculate that with their support, or mere acquiescence, Mr. Trump could get away with it. The overwhelming majority of Americans, including most Republicans, want Mr. Mueller to keep his job, and perhaps a groundswell of revulsion at unchecked presidential power would follow any action against the special counsel. But many Americans, weary of the shouting in Washington, might dismiss the whole thing as another food fight. We can be fairly certain that the pressure on Republican lawmakers from the minority of Americans who support Mr. Trump, as well as from the likes of Fox News and Sinclair, would be intense.

Of course, it’s when overriding your principles is the easy thing to do that you have an urgent responsibility, and opportunity, to demonstrate that you have some.

Look at what’s happening in Missouri right now. The state’s Republican governor, Eric Greitens, has been accused of sexual assault and coercion, and is scheduled to face trial next month on a felony charge of invasion of privacy. It’s a scandal of Trumpian proportions, and Mr. Greitens is responding with Trumpian bravado, calling the investigation and prosecution a “political witch hunt.”

Other Republicans On The Rule Of Law “In a country based on the system of laws, which is really the great gift given to us under the terms of our Constitution, there needs to be a consistency of application. The idea that all people are equal under the law is not a relative term.” — JUDD GREGG, 1999 “I have asked myself how men from an era when honor was valued above all other traits, men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and James Madison, might have viewed a President who committed perjury and obstruction of justice for personal and political gain.” — Phil Gramm, 1999 “What standard of conduct should we insist our President live up to? ... Do not underestimate, my friends, the corrupting and cynical signal we will send if we fail to enforce the highest standards of conduct on the most powerful man in the nation.” — Pete Domenici, 1999 “Committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office.” — Orrin Hatch, 1999

Yet the legislative report detailing his misbehavior was bipartisan, and top state Republicans have spoken out forcefully. They recognize that Mr. Greitens is unfit. (They also see a threat to their political interests, but the two can go hand in hand.)

Or look at Watergate. We may think of it now as a two-year drama with an inevitable end, the takedown of a president who tried to cover up a criminal conspiracy. But many people forget how close President Richard Nixon came to surviving the affair. He was forced from office only because enough Republican leaders recognized the legitimacy of the investigation and stood up to him. And even then, it took the revelation of incriminating recordings. No recordings have come out this time — yet.

A few senior Republicans have been saying the right things — including Mr. Hatch. He tweeted that anyone telling the president to fire Mr. Mueller “does not have the President or the nation’s best interest at heart.” Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, warned Mr. Trump that firing Mr. Mueller would be “the beginning of the end of his presidency.”

That’s all necessary and good. But it’s not enough. More Republicans need to make it clear that they won’t tolerate any action against either man, and that firing Mr. Mueller would be, as Senator Charles Grassley said, “suicide.”

Mr. Mueller’s investigation has already yielded great benefit to the country, including the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies for trying to undermine the presidential election. None of us can know if prosecutors will eventually point the finger at the president himself. But should Mr. Trump move to hobble or kill the investigation, he would darken rather than dispel the cloud of suspicion around him. Far worse, he would free future presidents to politicize American justice. That would be a danger to every American, of whatever political leaning.“This great nation can tolerate a president who makes mistakes,” declared Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican. “But it cannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to cover it up.”

No, Mr. Hatch wasn’t talking about Donald Trump. It was 1999, and he was talking about Bill Clinton.

At that time, the American system — and the flawed yet sometimes heroic people their fellow Americans choose to lead them — underwent, and passed, a hard test: The president, his financial dealings and his personal relationships were painstakingly investigated for years. Prosecutors ultimately accused Mr. Clinton of lying under oath, to cover up a sexual affair. The House of Representatives impeached him, but the Senate declined to convict, and Mr. Clinton stayed in office.

The public, which learned in detail about everything investigators believed Mr. Clinton had done wrong, overwhelmingly agreed with the judgment of the Senate. It was a sad and sordid and at times distracting business, but the system worked.

Now Mr. Hatch and his fellow lawmakers may be approaching a harsher and more consequential test. We quote his words not to level some sort of accusation of hypocrisy, but to remind us all of what is at stake.

News reports point to a growing possibility that President Trump may act to cripple or shut down an investigation by the nation’s top law-enforcement agencies into his campaign and administration. Lawmakers need to be preparing now for that possibility because if and when it comes to pass, they will suddenly find themselves on the edge of an abyss, with the Constitution in their hands.

Make no mistake: If Mr. Trump takes such drastic action, he will be striking at the foundation of the American government, attempting to set a precedent that a president, alone among American citizens, is above the law. What can seem now like a political sideshow will instantly become a constitutional crisis, and history will come calling for Mr. Hatch and his colleagues.

For months, investigators have been examining whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with the Russian government to undermine American democracy, and whether the president misused his power by obstructing justice in an effort to end that investigation.

Until the last few weeks, Mr. Trump had shown restraint, by his standards, anyway. He and his lawyers cooperated with investigators. Mr. Trump never tweeted directly about Robert Mueller, the special counsel, and spoke about him publicly only when asked.

Alas, that whiff of higher executive function is gone. Mr. Trump is openly attacking both Mr. Mueller and Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed by Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Rosenstein is overseeing the Russia investigation and signing off on Mr. Mueller’s actions.

Of course, this president has been known to huff and puff, to bluff and bluster, and he may be doing no more than that now. He may choose not to fire either man. We know he has already twice told his aides he wanted Mr. Mueller fired, only to be talked out of such rash action.

But if the president does move against the investigators, it will be up to Congress to affirm the rule of law, the separation of powers and the American constitutional order. The miserable polarization and partisan anger that have been rising in American life for decades will hit a new crescendo, and that will present congressional Republicans with a heavy burden indeed.

Mr. Trump’s Tweets on the Rule of Law

Yet if Mr. Trump goes after Mr. Mueller or Mr. Rosenstein, even Republicans who have misgivings about the president might be inclined to fall into line. They may resent what feels like an endless investigation, one that is endangering their agenda; or they may resent partisan attacks on Mr. Trump. Such frustrations — like ones Democrats vented when Mr. Clinton was in investigators’ sights — are certainly understandable. Republicans may also find themselves tempted by the political running room they would have with the investigation ended and the three branches of government under their control.

Maybe — and this is the scariest contingency to contemplate — Republican leaders would calculate that with their support, or mere acquiescence, Mr. Trump could get away with it. The overwhelming majority of Americans, including most Republicans, want Mr. Mueller to keep his job, and perhaps a groundswell of revulsion at unchecked presidential power would follow any action against the special counsel. But many Americans, weary of the shouting in Washington, might dismiss the whole thing as another food fight. We can be fairly certain that the pressure on Republican lawmakers from the minority of Americans who support Mr. Trump, as well as from the likes of Fox News and Sinclair, would be intense.

Of course, it’s when overriding your principles is the easy thing to do that you have an urgent responsibility, and opportunity, to demonstrate that you have some.

Look at what’s happening in Missouri right now. The state’s Republican governor, Eric Greitens, has been accused of sexual assault and coercion, and is scheduled to face trial next month on a felony charge of invasion of privacy. It’s a scandal of Trumpian proportions, and Mr. Greitens is responding with Trumpian bravado, calling the investigation and prosecution a “political witch hunt.”

Other Republicans On The Rule Of Law “In a country based on the system of laws, which is really the great gift given to us under the terms of our Constitution, there needs to be a consistency of application. The idea that all people are equal under the law is not a relative term.” — JUDD GREGG, 1999 “I have asked myself how men from an era when honor was valued above all other traits, men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and James Madison, might have viewed a President who committed perjury and obstruction of justice for personal and political gain.” — Phil Gramm, 1999 “What standard of conduct should we insist our President live up to? ... Do not underestimate, my friends, the corrupting and cynical signal we will send if we fail to enforce the highest standards of conduct on the most powerful man in the nation.” — Pete Domenici, 1999 “Committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction of justice go to the heart of qualification for public office.” — Orrin Hatch, 1999

Yet the legislative report detailing his misbehavior was bipartisan, and top state Republicans have spoken out forcefully. They recognize that Mr. Greitens is unfit. (They also see a threat to their political interests, but the two can go hand in hand.)

Or look at Watergate. We may think of it now as a two-year drama with an inevitable end, the takedown of a president who tried to cover up a criminal conspiracy. But many people forget how close President Richard Nixon came to surviving the affair. He was forced from office only because enough Republican leaders recognized the legitimacy of the investigation and stood up to him. And even then, it took the revelation of incriminating recordings. No recordings have come out this time — yet.

A few senior Republicans have been saying the right things — including Mr. Hatch. He tweeted that anyone telling the president to fire Mr. Mueller “does not have the President or the nation’s best interest at heart.” Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, warned Mr. Trump that firing Mr. Mueller would be “the beginning of the end of his presidency.”

That’s all necessary and good. But it’s not enough. More Republicans need to make it clear that they won’t tolerate any action against either man, and that firing Mr. Mueller would be, as Senator Charles Grassley said, “suicide.”

Mr. Mueller’s investigation has already yielded great benefit to the country, including the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies for trying to undermine the presidential election. None of us can know if prosecutors will eventually point the finger at the president himself. But should Mr. Trump move to hobble or kill the investigation, he would darken rather than dispel the cloud of suspicion around him. Far worse, he would free future presidents to politicize American justice. That would be a danger to every American, of whatever political leaning.But the president’s speech gave no indication that he will in fact respect his decision last year to remain faithful to the 1973 law. Worse yet, in his follow-up, the defense secretary, James Mattis, advanced a much more aggressive position, asserting that “the president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force overseas to defend important U.S. national interests.”

This is precisely the view notoriously advanced by John Yoo during the early years of President George W. Bush’s administration. If Mr. Trump fails to notify Congress, as required by the 1973 statute, he will be repudiating his own precedent and embracing an extreme position that even President George H.W. Bush rejected during the second term of his administration. To be sure, Mr. Yoo made his sweeping claims to defend the commander in chief’s authority to torture terrorists, while Mr. Mattis is making Yoo-like arguments to support the noble cause of suppressing chemical warfare. But once Mr. Mattis’ sweeping assertion of presidential power is accepted, it will be used as a precedent by Mr. Trump to ignore the War Powers Resolution whenever he, and he alone, is persuaded that “important national interests” justify future military adventures.

Defenders of presidential war-making back up their position by claiming that Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibility to serve as the ultimate arbiter over war and peace. But this is false. In passing its omnibus appropriations bill only last month, Congress was careful to provide that “none of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to Syria in contravention of the War Powers Resolution, including for the introduction of United States armed or military forces into hostilities in Syria.”

Congress even more recently responded to Mr. Trump’s military escalation in the Middle East by reinvigorating its authority under the War Powers Resolution. Its reassertion of war-making power was provoked by Mr. Trump’s unilateral military support for Saudi Arabia’s war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Earlier this month, a bipartisan senatorial coalition invoked a special provision of the War Powers Resolution to force a floor vote condemning Mr. Trump’s action. While this motion was returned to the Foreign Relations Committee by a margin of 55 to 44, it was only after the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, promised to consider legislation this week that could limit the president’s war-making authority against Islamic militants.

Mr. Corker should rapidly follow through on his commitment if Mr. Trump fails to provide Congress the required notice under the War Powers Resolution. If Mr. Corker hesitates, members of the Senate and the House should fill the gap, and follow the example recently set in the Yemen case. This not only allows them to invoke a special provision of the resolution to force a timely vote on Mr. Trump’s Syrian campaign; it also prevents any efforts to filibuster or delay their initiative, since the War Powers Resolution requires a final vote “within three calendar days” after members have forced their motion onto the floor of each house.We are now in the midst of an epic clash between Donald Trump and fired F.B.I. Director James Comey, neither of whom I hold in high esteem, both men with raging egos and questionable motives.

The depth of my contempt differs between the two, but there is contempt for both.

Comey is now making the rounds promoting his new book, which will no doubt be a monster best seller. Good for him. But Comey for me is a complicated character, a man of honorable service and flashes of horrendous judgment.

His inexplicable handling of the investigations into Clinton’s emails is unforgivable.

He made reckless and harmful disclosures and proclamations about the Clinton investigation while not whispering a word about the concurrent investigation into the Trump campaign.

He says that the letter he released about a new phase of the Clinton email investigation just days before the election may have been colored by polling suggesting that Clinton was going to win, but that too is problematic.The charts here tell the story, and I’ll get into the details in a moment. But I first want to spend a few moments on the perception gap, because it highlights a problem that’s bigger than budget policy.

The country’s political impressions are heavily influenced by people who are supposed to be neutral observers — reporters, television anchors, think-tank experts and the like. They’re not perfectly neutral, of course. They have their biases. But most aspire to partisan neutrality. It’s an honorable aspiration.

And it’s not easy to achieve. For one thing, they’re inundated by partisan advocates. If your job involved listening to people claim that, say, the Obama administration’s Syria policy was a success or that George W. Bush’s economic record was underrated, you too would develop a robust skepticism.

The problem is this skepticism often morphs into a formulaic approach that can itself become untethered from reality. Whatever the facts, many journalists and Washington experts revert to familiar storylines: Both sides are hypocritical. The parties care more about scoring partisan points than getting anything done. The extremists have taken over, and there are no moderates left.

All of these storylines have at least some truth to them. Like a stopped clock, they sometimes have a lot of truth. But they are indeed like a stopped clock. They never change.In the aftermath of Dr. King’s death, the civil rights movement was still a powerful force, leveling obstacles wherever it could, even out there on the prairie. Women were beginning to benefit from the addition of the word “sex” to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and as the decade progressed, other groups began to assert their own claims to justice. Only five days before Kennedy’s visit to Pine Ridge, Lyndon Johnson signed the Indian Civil Rights Act.

Kennedy’s searing experience on a speaking tour of South Africa in 1966 may have had something to do with it, too. In Cape Town and elsewhere, he had enraged the apartheid regime with his forceful speeches against racial oppression. South Africa had created “homelands,” as the government called them; critics called them “Bantustans.” African tribal populations were relocated there, to live in deep poverty. They were not very different from Native American reservations.

As a senator, Kennedy had focused increasingly on poverty, urban and rural, calling attention to inequality in a series of trips into some of the poorest parts of the country. In early February, he spent two days in eastern Kentucky’s coal country, meeting with families trying to survive day to day. It was as if he were the senator from a much larger constituency than New York.

For all of these reasons, it was no surprise to see Kennedy devote extraordinary resources to a political constituency that had no ability to elect him. According to the historian Thurston Clarke, Kennedy scheduled approximately 70 events during the first month of his campaign — 10 of them on Indian reservations or at Indian schools.

He began his journey on the morning of April 16. It required a complicated set of flights to reach a tiny town in Nebraska that served as the nearest airport. The long drive from there to the reservation in South Dakota was an education in itself. There was no infrastructure of the type Americans were used to. No buses, no banks, no supermarkets. Unemployment was 75 percent. Half of the homes lacked electricity or running water. Schools had no supplies. Life expectancy — 48 years for men, 52 for women — was the second-lowest in the hemisphere, after that in Haiti.

Twelve days earlier, Kennedy had accomplished what seemed impossible, when he connected with an angry and distrustful African-American audience in Indianapolis the night that Dr. King was killed. A few days later, after attending a Sunday church service in Washington, he took an impromptu walk through the riot-torn parts of the city, attracting an awe-struck crowd of hundreds. Now he was doing it again, forging a common bond with fellow citizens who looked nothing like him.

Kennedy’s motorcade stopped here and there; at Calico Village he sat with a 10-year-old Lakota Sioux, Christopher Pretty Boy, who had lost his parents in a car crash a week earlier. McGovern had tagged along for the day, and together he and Kennedy convened a public hearing of their subcommittee, in a community hall. More than a thousand attended. McGovern later said that he had never seen “so many Indian voters assembled in one place.” He and Kennedy listened as people poured out their stories of hunger, joblessness and inadequate health care.

After the hearing ended, Kennedy made an impetuous request: to see the small monument commemorating the massacre of Native Americans at Wounded Knee in 1890. As McGovern later recalled, it was just “a very simple, concrete slab with a small obelisk, and a little church out on the plains. It’s a very desolate area. It’s a mass grave.” But they went 30 miles out of their way to see it, even with a crowd of 5,000 waiting in the rain for a rally in Rapid City. Then, at the end of a long day, Kennedy flew to Eugene, Ore., for another day of campaigning.ST. LOUIS — This past week, President Trump and House Republicans took initial steps to cut back the social safety net. Both have argued that such spending is counterproductive and wasteful, and that eligibility must be tightened for programs including food stamps and Medicaid. Mr. Trump and House Republicans have also asserted that welfare benefits are far too generous, and work requirements much too lax.

Yet as is so often the case, the reality is much different from what the political rhetoric says. The United States has the weakest safety net among the Western industrialized nations, devoting far fewer resources as a percentage of gross domestic product to welfare programs than do other wealthy countries.

Partly as a result, a majority of Americans will experience poverty during their lives, and America’s rate of poverty consistently ranks at or near the top in international comparisons. Rather than slashing anti-poverty programs, the fiscally prudent question to ask is: How much does this high rate of poverty cost our nation in dollars and cents?

Clearly, poverty extracts a heavy toll upon those who fall into its ranks, particularly children. Countless studies have demonstrated the physical and psychological health costs for children experiencing poverty.White people have told me where to go: “Yancy, flights leave for Africa every day. We can all admit bringing you to this country was a mistake, so let us get rid of you and correct the mistake. You are not happy, we are not happy with your behavior, so do it.” Or “There are two ways you can return to Africa: On a passenger ship, or in a coffin freighter. Choose quickly.” Notice the urgency of that warning, the implied threat to my life.

You see, for many white Americans, I am disposable. For others, I’m more beast than human. “This ignorant monkey has no audience but other ignorant monkeys.” Or, “This monkey isn’t talking to me.” Or, “As I see it, the only people whose racism is a problem is colored monkeys. They don’t want to live without White people. They CAN’T live without White people.”

For other whites, I am both subhuman and vermin. The words don’t lie: “Dear Black America, let go of your black victimhood and bring yourself to the point of admission that you hoodrats and pavement apes are the ones destroying black lives and communities. And in closing, don’t blame Whitey!”

And then there are those unspeakable white projections. “In a sane world, this ugly Nigger would be just beheaded ISIS style. Make America WHITE Again.” Or “This Nigger needs to have a meat hook lovingly, well, you know, time to use your own imagination!” Others are quick to recommend that I act in my own “best interest”: “Kill Yourself. Do it Immediately.”

Beheaded ISIS style? A meat hook? Kill myself? Reader, the sickness of these threats should trouble your very soul.

James Baldwin writes, “People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.” White America has long lost its innocence. Given its horrendous treatment of the indigenous peoples of this land, there was never any innocence. There were monsters, though. Land takers. Brutal dispossession. And then body snatchers and the selling and buying of black flesh. To be haunted while asleep has its advantages, because one will awake. But to be haunted while awake by a teratology of whiteness is far more frightening.

Yet just when I began to unmoor, a braver white America began to speak, to risk, to love. Perhaps for the first time, these white readers took off their masks, even if only for a moment, to hear me. Then again, perhaps they had already known about the difficulties involved in removing their masks, knowing how hard it is to avoid falling back on “white innocence.” They entered that space of risk and honesty where they dared to tell the truth about their whiteness. “Thanks Professor Yancy for your thoughts,” one woman wrote. “The system is racist. As a white woman, I am responsible to dismantle that system as well as the attitudes in me that growing up in the system created. I am responsible for speaking out when I hear racist comments.”White people have told me where to go: “Yancy, flights leave for Africa every day.

While we waited for President Carter to arrive, I chatted with a Baptist minister sitting in the pew behind me about a recent interview with Stephen Colbert, in which Mr. Carter hinted that he considers the sitting president of the United States a liar. Asked what it takes to be president, he told Mr. Colbert, “I used to think it was to tell the truth. But I’ve changed my mind lately.”

There were flashes of the same impish wit on display at the church in Plains. “Do we have any visitors this morning?” he joked to the crowd. He asked where we were all from, and voices sang out from places like Cameroon, Israel, Uzbekistan.

When it was time for the lesson itself, President Carter stood smiling and spoke without referring to notes, moving to the lectern only to read from the scripture. The text was from the Acts of the Apostles, passages concerning the priorities of the early church. “They worshiped together. They had fellowship together. And a third thing: They took care of each other’s needs, even in a sacrificial way,” he said. He spoke particularly about the generosity of Barnabas, who sold his own field and gave the money to Jesus’ apostles to distribute to the needy.

President Carter is not a pacing, gesturing, booming-voiced orator, but he is a brilliant teacher — moving nimbly between his memories, his concerns for the world and what the Acts have to say about the right relationship of human beings to one another. He asks questions, nods encouragement when an answer is close but keeps nudging until someone hits on the point he’s trying to make.

“We have lost faith in a lot of things that have always nurtured us,” he said. “Many people in the world have lost faith in democracy. We’ve lost faith in the sanctity of telling the truth and the value of education. We’ve lost faith in the equality of people. In our country’s history, some of our greatest struggles have been over the issue of equality.”

Then he asked the congregation what year women in the United States gained the right to vote.

Several called out “1920!” But it was a trick question. “That was white women,” he reminded us. “A lot of white people don’t remember that distinction.”

He spoke movingly about his first security briefing as president-elect, about the solemn responsibility of the country’s commander in chief to safeguard nuclear weapons. “If we don’t figure out as collective human beings how to get along with each other, even the people we don’t like and with whom we don’t agree — say the Americans and the Russians, the Americans and the Chinese, the Americans and anybody else — if we don’t figure out collectively how to get along with each other and take care of each other, that might be the end of humanity.”Thanks to the early riser in the motel room next door, I made it into the sanctuary.

The attacks were killing their Libyan interlocutors — including those who were helping investigate the 2012 attack.

The violence also paved the way for a would-be savior in Benghazi: a septuagenarian general named Khalifa Haftar, who had defected from Muammar el-Qaddafi’s army in the 1980s and fled to the United States, before returning to Libya in 2011 during the revolution. Shunned by Libya’s rebel leadership, General Haftar took center stage in May 2014 when he launched an assault on Benghazi’s Islamist militias with a coalition of disaffected military units and tribal supporters. Operation Dignity, as it was called, marked the start of Libya’s civil war, inviting intervention by competing regional powers and spawning fissures that have yet to close.

Though Washington kept him at a distance, some welcomed his campaign. After all, he’d pitched it as a war on terrorists who killed Americans. That was true to an extent. When American special operations forces grabbed Ahmed Abu Khatala, the principal suspect in the attack, outside of Benghazi in June 2014, he was fleeing General Haftar’s forces. But the battle lines were not as clear as they seemed. His operation forced more moderate Islamists who’d supported the Libyan state to close ranks with radicals — a process that was already underway. He targeted some of the very militiamen who’d helped the Americans the night of the attack.

One of them was Mr. Obeidi. His militia, Libya Shield, was among those attacked by General Haftar, and it ended up on the front lines with more extreme groups. As weapons and funds from outside the country tilted the war in General Haftar’s favor, Mr. Obeidi fled Benghazi.

When he met me for coffee one evening last summer he was dressed in a white prayer gown and wearing tinted wire glasses. He seemed to me then an emissary of Libya’s morass and an emblem of the tangled loyalties that had confounded America’s policy. Critics have accused the Americans of misplacing their trust in militiamen the night of the attack. But given the absence of any real police or army that night, militiamen like Mr. Obeidi were the only option. There was no black and white; only shades of gray.

American policy in Libya today is again confronted by shades of gray and a counterterrorism narrative that tends to flatten and obscure complexities. That narrative continues to be pushed by the aspiring strongman General Haftar, in his dealings with the Trump administration. It suffered a blow when General Haftar was hospitalized in France last week. In truth, his value as a counterterrorism partner was always limited: His military coalition has been weakened by tribal and factional fissures and his political ambitions made him a deeply polarizing. His disappearance from the scene would herald a new chapter of uncertainty in Libya — but also opportunities for renewed American diplomacy.

The diminished American engagement is felt across Libya, but especially in Benghazi, where people lament the tarring of their city’s image with negative portrayals of violence and terrorism. They long for the return of the Americans and for the outreach that was the hallmark of Chris Stevens, the American ambassador killed that night.

Elsewhere across the country, Libyans who fled Benghazi have similar views. When I saw Mr. Obeidi, he pleaded with me for help. “We helped you and now you’ve abandoned us,” he said. And then, to underscore his point, he showed me a scan of a certificate that the Americans had given him shortly after the 2012 attack, signed by American diplomats:

“Fathi went above and beyond in order to provide security and facilitate movement for the American Rescue forces sent to evacuate all U.S. personnel in Benghazi. Fathi was committed and professional in every way, he continually risked his life and the life of his men. …”Here’s how a dispenser works: It is shaped like a cylinder with three buttons on top indicating a “one minute,” “three minute” or “five minute” story. (That’s how long it takes to read.) When a button is pushed, a short story is printed, unfurled on a long strip of paper.

The stories are free. They are retrieved from a computer catalog of more than 100,000 original submissions by writers whose work has been evaluated by Short Edition’s judges, and transmitted over a mobile network. Offerings can be tailored to specific interests: children’s fiction, romance, even holiday-themed tales.

Scott Varner, executive director of strategic communications for Columbus City Schools in Ohio, said his district will have a total of five kiosks, the first two of which were installed in December. Stories are divided into two categories: young readers and everybody else. “We want to build excitement around reading,” he said. “Especially among families.”

Short Edition gets stories for its catalog by holding writing contests. It is currently holding one for students and faculty at Penn State called “New Beginnings.” Mr. Varner asked if the company might hold a contest for stories about Columbus by local students and they are considering it, he said.

“It would be great to have 10th graders writing stories for third graders,” he said.

Short Edition, which is based in Grenoble and was founded by publishing executives, set up its first kiosk in 2016 and has 150 machines worldwide. “We want to create a platform for independent artists, like the Sundance Institute,” said Kristan Leroy, the export director at Short Edition. The dispensers cost $9,200 plus an additional $190 per month for content and software. The only thing that needs to be replaced is paper. The printed stories have a double life, shared an average of 2.1 times, said Ms. Leroy.

“The idea is to make people happy,” she said. “There is too much doom and gloom today.”

The first dispenser in the United States was at Mr. Coppola’s San Francisco cafe in 2016. At the time, the director said the stories had the allure of classic manuscripts. “I’d like to see the city of San Francisco put them everywhere so that while waiting for a bus, or marriage license, or lunch, you could get an artistic lift, free of charge,” he said.

That hasn’t happened — yet. Mr. Nurkin, of the Free Library of Philadelphia, has high hopes for his city. “We are interested in finding sites to engage audiences who aren’t necessarily coming to the library,” he said. So much so, the library is considering installing dispensers at the Family Court Building and the Philadelphia International Airport.

Eyebrows have become an obsession of late, tattooed or microbladed, shaped and drawn in bold dark lines, making a statement far beyond braiding or waxing.

Lifting one and not the other often signals disbelief, amusement, curiosity. Raising both can suggest surprise or dismay. But it wasn’t always that way.

Early humans had thick, bony brow ridges that were far less nimble than ours, incapable of expressing much of anything beyond, “Don’t mess with me, Thag.”

Scientists have long thought those brows served some structural purpose, like support for chewing prehistoric food. That they could also be used to signal aggression or intimidate competitors was largely dismissed as an evolutionary perk, as were the more flamboyant brows of modern humans.

But when Ricardo Miguel Godinho, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of York, made digital recreations of a skull believed to be 300,000 to 125,000 years old, he found no evidence that its brow ridges provided any of the practical benefits suggested by earlier studies. “He tested out the different possible explanations, and, effectively, there’s no reason for it,” said Penny Spikins, an anthropologist who conducted the study with Dr. Godinho.TEHRAN — If you are Iranian, much of your life for the past few years has depended on a messaging app called Telegram. It has become something of a parallel, but uncensored, internet.

Since 2013, Telegram has replaced email, chat, forums, blogs, news websites, e-commerce, social networks, dating services and, for many, even television. With Telegram, Iranians keep in touch with family and friends, read the news, shop, discuss soccer, babies, marriage and politics. It’s the best of Twitter and the most viral videos on YouTube. People use it to download music and films, and, of course, to flirt. They also use it to read speeches from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who blasts out content over his official channel.

Part of the reason Telegram is so popular is it’s easy to use. Another reason is more political: Since the pro-reform protests in 2009, the hard-liners in Iran’s government, working through their allies in the judiciary and security services, have effectively blocked nearly all foreign-based blogging and publishing platforms, social media and messaging apps.

Now they want to do the same with Telegram. On March 31, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a hard-line member of Parliament and the head of its National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, announced that Telegram would be blocked for security reasons by the end of April. “This was a decision made at the highest levels, and Telegram will be replaced by a domestic app,” Mr. Boroujerdi said. A few days later, Abolhassan Firouzabadi, secretary of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace, which was established by Ayatollah Khamenei in 2012, appended an unlikely economic case against Telegram, which had announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency: “Telegram is seeking to turn the Iranian economy into an intermediary company, and that will destroy jobs such as in real estate and auto trading,” he said. (Telegram doesn’t plan to offer its cryptocurrency to countries that, like Iran, are under Western or United Nations sanctions.)Q. I cannot even get my Canon printer on my wireless network in the first place so I can register it or print anything with a Chromebook. Where do I start?

A. Canon makes a large number of different printers, and the wireless setup steps will vary based on the model you have. If you cannot reach anybody on the company’s telephone support lines to walk you through the process, check the technical support area of Canon’s printers site for instructional videos or browse the page devoted to wireless printing. The Canon video library has clips that guide you through the wireless setup for several printers, and you may be able to find one for your specific model. In some cases, you may need a smartphone or a computer to help get the printer on the network.Now, 90 years after her death, Ms. Bayes is getting a headstone. On April 21, a group of Nora Bayes enthusiasts will gather at her grave site — Sassafras Plot, Section 129 — where a simple granite headstone will be unveiled.

The program includes singing her signature tunes — including her 1908 hit “Shine On, Harvest Moon,” and “Over There,” which she helped popularize in 1917 — and playing her original 78 r.p.m. records on a windup phonograph operated by Michael Cumella, a devotee from Brooklyn who last year began crusading for the headstone after having difficulty finding Ms. Bayes’s grave.

After looking further into her burial, Mr. Cumella found more mystery. After Ms. Bayes’s death, her fifth husband, Benjamin Friedland, continued to make monthly payments to Woodlawn over the 18-year period so that Ms. Bayes could remain in the receiving tomb, even after he remarried and continued to raise the three young children Ms. Bayes had adopted before marrying him in 1925.

The sensational headlines that she made during her life continued, as newspapers continued to run articles on the oddity of Ms. Bayes, a pre-eminent star of Broadway and vaudeville, remaining in limbo. Mr. Friedland, who retained sole burial rights for Ms. Bayes, gave no public explanations, nor did he accept offers from her fans and peers to handle the burial.

After Mr. Friedland died in 1946, his second wife, Louise Clarke Friedland, bought a plot at Woodlawn so that he and his famous first wife could be buried side by side. Ms. Friedland never placed a headstone to mark the pair, and never joined them when she died in 1973. She was cremated elsewhere.

Ms. Friedland never explained publicly why she had purchased a plot large enough for five coffins, just to bury those of her husband and Ms. Bayes together, with no apparent intention of being buried there herself, said Susan Olsen, the cemetery historian.

“We have people buried here with ex-wives, with multiple wives,” she said. “Sometimes the placement of the remains tells the story in itself.”

There was no mention of burial or funeral arrangements in Nora Bayes’s will, said her youngest grandchild, Ginny Bayes, 58, of Colorado Springs.

Family speculation was that it may have been Mr. Friedland’s wish to be buried at the same time as Ms. Bayes, “allowing him to spend eternity alongside his beloved first wife,” Ginny Bayes said.

Ms. Friedland may have purposely left the graves unmarked because she “did not share his enthusiasm” for this arrangement, Ginny Bayes said, or it simply may have been the wish of Nora Bayes, who was very private about parts of her personal life. Ultimately, Ginny Bayes said, “It was a mystery then and is still a mystery today.”

Ginny Bayes said her father, Peter Bayes, the youngest of Ms. Bayes’s three adopted children, attended the 1946 burial. But perhaps because he was so upset by his mother’s death, he may never have visited the grave after that and may not have known that it remained unmarked. Ginny Bayes said the issue of the unmarked grave never came up among his six children, whom he raised in Colorado, until she realized it while doing genealogical research several years ago.

Without a headstone, Ms. Bayes remained largely left off the cemetery’s long lists for visitors of notables, which include Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Irving Berlin.

Mr. Cumella, who collects and repairs crank-up phonographs like Victrolas and has a collection of original Nora Bayes records, was hoping to add Ms. Bayes’s grave to a Woodlawn tour he conducts while using a portable antique turntable to play records of jazz and vaudeville greats at their grave sites.

A group Mr. Cumella took to Woodlawn last summer was moved when he placed a Victrola beside Ms. Bayes’s grave site and played “Turn Off Your Light, Mr. Moon Man,” which Ms. Bayes wrote with her second husband, Jack Norworth. (Mr. Norworth also wrote the lyrics to “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” which was first performed by Ms. Bayes.)

Around that time, Mr. Cumella asked Woodlawn officials why Ms. Bayes had no marker. They said that they needed permission from the purchaser of the plot, Ms. Friedland, but that they could not reach any of her descendants. Still, Woodlawn officials told him they were looking to honor Ms. Bayes, especially having just received an outpouring of responses to a Facebook post about the centennial of “Over There,” which Ms. Bayes was chosen to debut by its composer, George M. Cohan, who is also buried at Woodlawn.

Prodded by Mr. Cumella’s monthly emails, Woodlawn officials told him a headstone would be created. After a renewed effort, they secured permission from a relative of Ms. Friedland’s, Ms. Olsen said.

She noted that Woodlawn had prominent figures who spent decades in unmarked graves, including the journalist Nellie Bly and the jazz luminaries King Oliver and Sonny Greer. And many people have spent long periods in Woodlawn’s receiving tombs while their monuments were constructed, including Miles Davis (nine months), the financier John Harbeck (eight years) and F. W. Woolworth (two years), according to Ms. Olsen.

But, she said, Ms. Bayes is “pretty much the record-holder.”

In her day, Ms. Bayes was one of the highest-paid women in the world. A charismatic figure, she courted scandal and tangled with theater bosses, including the powerful Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., who made her a member of the Ziegfeld Follies and battled Ms. Bayes over her rivalry with another Follies member, Sophie Tucker.

During her lifetime, Ms. Bayes had a Broadway Theater named for her on West 44th Street. She was depicted in the 1944 biographical film “Shine On, Harvest Moon” and was played by Frances Langford in the 1942 movie about Cohan, “Yankee Doodle Dandy” with James Cagney.

Mr. Cumella called the headstone the fulfillment of a graveside promise to the spirit of Ms. Bayes last year.

“I communed with her for a moment and made a pledge that I would see what I could do,” he said.

“I said, ‘Let’s just do it, because she deserves it,’” he added. “I didn’t let it go.”Photo

MACBETH

By Jo Nesbo

Translated by Don Bartlett

446 pp. Hogarth. $27.

In 1937, The New Yorker published James Thurber’s “The Macbeth Murder Mystery,” about an avid reader of Agatha Christie who picks up a paperback copy of “Macbeth,” mistakenly assuming it’s a detective story. She soon discovers it’s a Shakespeare play but is already hooked and reads it as a whodunit. It takes her a while to identify who killed Duncan, after initially refusing to believe the Macbeths were responsible: “You suspect them the most, of course, but those are the ones that are never guilty — or shouldn’t be, anyway.” Her prime suspect had been Banquo, but “then, of course, he was the second person killed. That was good right in there, that part. The person you suspect of the first murder should always be the second victim.”

It’s a very funny story and an insightful one, for Thurber shows how closely Shakespeare’s tragedy follows the contours of detective fiction. Thurber wasn’t the first to draw such connections; over a century earlier, in a brilliant essay about the play — “On the Knocking at the Gate in ‘Macbeth’” — Thomas De Quincey had reflected on how deeply Shakespeare understood the interplay of murder and suspense. If the many allusions to “Macbeth” in the works of Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, P. D. James and other crime writers are any indication, Shakespeare’s play may be seen as one of the great progenitors of the genre, making Jo Nesbo, the celebrated Norwegian writer of thrillers, an ideal choice to update the play for Hogarth Shakespeare, a series in which best-selling novelists turn Shakespeare’s works into contemporary fiction.

Nesbo has spoken of finding himself on familiar terrain here, arguing that “Macbeth” is essentially a “thriller about the struggle for power” that takes place “in a gloomy, stormy crime noir-like setting and in a dark, paranoid human mind.” True enough, yet many features of this 400-year-old tragedy don’t easily fit the demands of a modern, realistic thriller. One of the pleasures of reading this book is watching Nesbo meet the formidable challenge of assimilating elements of the play unsuited to realistic crime fiction, especially the supernatural: the witches, prophecies, visions, and the mysterious figure of Hecate.

Nesbo’s most consequential decision was when and where to set his story. While he follows Shakespeare in locating it in Scotland, rather than taking us back to the 11th century he places it in the early 1970s. He doesn’t name the city, though there are many hints that it’s Glasgow. This choice signals Nesbo’s ambitions for his novel, giving it a sharp social edge as well as a timely political resonance. The Glasgow of that era was a desperately grim place, not unlike those parts of America now ravaged by the opioid crisis: It was staggered by alcoholism, environmental hazards, high suicide rates, corruption, gang warfare, the loss of industrial jobs and a significant rise in drug abuse. Things were so bad that historians speak of the “Glasgow effect” to account for why Glaswegians died younger and suffered more than those who lived in comparable places.

It’s tougher than it looks to create a world that is faithful to Shakespeare’s original while also feeling modern and real. Placing Shakespeare’s story in a late-20th-century world of drugs, gangs and corrupt civic leaders goes a long way toward solving this problem. “Brew” — the term used for the drug to which so many are addicted — is at the heart of Nesbo’s novel and neatly straddles the murky world of Shakespeare’s witches, with their caldron, and that of modern drug labs. By making addiction so central to his plot, Nesbo also makes Macbeth’s paranoia and hallucinatory visions, so crucial to Shakespeare’s play, not just believable but meaningful in a contemporary way.NEW DELHI — The schoolgirls ran into the auditorium, shouting, “Let’s go, let’s go,” in Hindi as they ushered one another into single-file lines. Some adjusted the big, red bows that held their braids together, part of their school uniform. Then they crouched into defensive postures, fists ready.

“Oss!” they yelled — a karate greeting combining the Japanese words for push and persevere.

They bowed slightly to their mentors before unleashing a series of punches, karate chops and kicks, interspersed with occasional giggles, whispers and sheepish smiles.

“Do not laugh!” Police Constable Renu, who like many Indians goes by one name, called from the stage above them, her white T-shirt emblazoned with “Respect Women” on the back.

“Do you think they will laugh when they attack you?” she asked. “You must strike back with anger.”Photo

Seven inmates were killed and 17 others were injured in a large riot that broke out Sunday night at a maximum-security prison in South Carolina, the authorities said.

The fights started around 7:15 p.m. in three housing units at Lee Correctional Institution, which houses some of the state’s most violent and longest-serving offenders. Officers were unable to stop the fighting and secure the prison until around 2:55 a.m. on Monday.

The state’s Corrections Department described the fights as “multiple inmate-on-inmate altercations.” No police officers or prison employees were injured, the department said.

Lee Correctional Institution, which opened in 1993, houses about 1,500 male inmates. It is in Bishopville, S.C., about 40 miles east of Columbia, the capital.

State officials have pledged for years to make South Carolina’s prisons, particularly Lee Correctional Institution, safer after a series of deadly fights. In 2013, Michael McCall, then the warden at Lee, said it was the most dangerous prison in South Carolina.

Two officers were stabbed there in a 2015 fight. An inmate was killed during a fight in July 2017, another was stabbed to death in November, and a third was killed in February.Mr. Johnson made the remarks as protesters returned to the store, a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia. Footage posted on social media showed protesters holding placards and chanting slogans against the company and the police action.

Last Thursday, the two men asked to use the restroom in the coffee shop but an employee refused the request because they had not bought anything, officials said. They sat down, and they were eventually asked to leave. When they declined, an employee called the police.

Some of what happened next was recorded in a video that has been viewed nearly 10 million times on Twitter and was described by Mr. Johnson as “very hard to watch.” Police officers surrounded the men and escorted one of them out of the Starbucks in handcuffs. The other soon followed.

The men, who have not been identified, were arrested on suspicion of trespassing. But Starbucks did not want to press charges and the men were later released, Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. of the Philadelphia Police Department said in a recorded statement on Saturday.

The prosecutor’s office in Philadelphia also reviewed the case and declined to charge the men because of “a lack of evidence that a crime was committed,” Benjamin Waxman, a spokesman for the office, has said.

A longer video of the episode shows the police talking with the men for at least four minutes before a white man, Andrew Yaffe, joins them and informs the police that the people they were about to take into custody were “not trespassing” and were meeting him there.

Mr. Johnson, on Monday, did not directly reply to a question about whether the employee who contacted the police would face disciplinary action, adding that it was his responsibility as chief executive to look “broadly” at what had happened.

The company apologized on Saturday afternoon. Later that day, while the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter, Mr. Johnson released a statement in which he called the situation a “reprehensible outcome.” He also said at that time that he hoped to meet the men in person and to offer a “face-to-face apology.”

He also pledged to investigate, and to “make any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.”

“Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling,” he said. “Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome — the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.”“There’s something to be said for the fact that you don’t need to honor black folks by pleasing white people,” said Quinton Lucas, a city councilman.

Mr. Lucas said he leaned toward giving the name to a street where white people tend to venture more often, because it could have a greater impact there. “There’s something to be said for the fact that you need to make sure the entire community honors it, instead of saying, ‘That’s something the black folks are doing for the black folks in a black area.’ ”

Complicating this naming fight is a simple truth: Kansas City, like much of the country, struggles with segregation.

Troost Avenue separates the east side of the city, where black residents are heavily concentrated, from the west. The coalition of black leaders, which includes Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democratic congressman and former mayor of Kansas City, has a street on the East Side in mind: Paseo Boulevard.

The Paseo, as it is known, cuts a 10-mile north-south path through Kansas City that is a mix of promise and struggle. Parts of the boulevard have wide, grassy medians, Grecian columns, pergolas and classically styled mansions. But it also passes blighted homes, empty lots and depressed property values. It was named after Paseo de la Reforma, a grand thoroughfare in Mexico City.

For two years, advocates have lobbied the parks board, which oversees the city’s boulevard system, to change the name. Jean-Paul Chaurand, the board president, responded last month with a letter stating that longstanding policy has been to name streets after local residents who made significant contributions to the city. He suggested creating a commission to discuss the renaming further.

That did not sit well with the advocates, who are pushing for the City Council to act, or for a referendum that would allow voters to decide the issue.

“It is a travesty to the progress of racial justice and racial integration that it’s being stopped,” said Vernon P. Howard Jr., president of the city’s chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a leader of the coalition pushing to rename Paseo Boulevard.

“Let’s have white folks cross east of Troost,” Mr. Howard said. “Let’s have them make this an integrated street, where they are required to stretch themselves and be a part of the African-American community.”

One prominent black leader who is skeptical of the idea is the mayor, Sly James. He worries that, by naming a street in a mostly black part of town after Dr. King, “are you just moving a dividing line?”

“I’m harkening back to all the cities that I’ve been to, and have seen an M.L.K. Boulevard,” he said. “I’ve never seen one in a shopping area. I’ve never seen one that’s been in anything other than a black neighborhood. Is Martin Luther King strictly a black hero? I would say not. I think he’s a hero for everybody, and he ought to be honored that way.”

At least 955 streets in the United States have been named after Dr. King, and they tend to be in lower-income areas with predominantly black populations, said Derek H. Alderman, a professor of geography at the University of Tennessee. But the idea that placing Dr. King’s name on a street somehow causes a community to decline is inaccurate, Dr. Alderman said. It is more likely the other way around.

“It’s because of the politics of the naming process,” he said. “Those were often the only streets that some African-American activists could get named for Dr. King.”

Since the first renaming of a street for Dr. King — in Chicago in 1968 — such moves have spurred debates in cities like Indianapolis a decade ago, and High Point, N.C., in 2015. Businesses and residents often complain about the hassles of address changes. Some people lament the supplanting of historical street names. Others say bluntly that the King name would hurt their communities.

In Kansas City, residents vehemently opposed a proposal years ago to rename Prospect Avenue on the East Side after Dr. King, saying it would do nothing to benefit a deeply struggling part of town.

Some residents have wondered whether it might be better to name an east-west street after Dr. King, because those streets connect black and white neighborhoods. Others have proposed streets in upscale areas that are mostly white, like the J.C. Nichols Parkway, which runs near the Country Club Plaza shopping district. Mr. Nichols, a developer who died in 1950, used racially restrictive covenants to prevent nonwhites from living in certain neighborhoods.

Mr. James, the mayor, appointed an advisory group this month to talk to residents and figure out the best way to honor Dr. King.

“Why not put it right in the heart of the affluent part of the city,” said Rita Hoop, a 50-year-old lawyer who is white, as she walked through the plaza, which Mr. Nichols designed. “That racial divide will not be addressed until every community addresses it, not just the black community.”

But when Warren Turner, 53, was asked if a King street should be placed in a white neighborhood, he did not mince words: “Hell, no.”

Mr. Turner, who has lived on the Paseo for a quarter-century, said it would be an honor to have it renamed because of what Dr. King meant to black people like him.

“I think, maybe it would bring some of the prestige back to the Paseo,” he said.While regulators called their decision a step forward in the availability of direct-to-consumer genetic screening, they explicitly warned that the test did not detect most mutations that increase breast cancer risk. They also warned consumers not to use the tests as a substitute for qualified medical care and genetic counseling.

Color, the genomics company, takes something of a middle road. It markets comprehensive medical diagnostic tests that screen for all mutations of certain genes known to be linked to certain kinds of heredity cancers and heart risks. It has doctors available to order its tests online for users and provides genetic counseling to discuss users’ results.

“By using genetics, you can help some people prevent or interrupt something at an earlier stage where the costs are much lower,” said Othman Laraki, chief executive of Color Genomics. The start-up advises users that they could develop major diseases even if their test results show no harmful mutations.

Executives at SAP and Nvidia said they hoped genetic screening might ultimately help prevent at least a few late-stage cancers, the kinds of life-threatening illnesses that can debilitate employees and cost companies with self-funded health plans more than $1 million in medical fees.

After Nvidia began offering free screening from Color last year, about 27 percent of its 6,000 eligible employees in the United States took the test. After SAP started subsidizing the genetic tests last year, about 17 percent of the company’s 30,000 eligible employees and family members participated.

“In the long-term view of a program like this, it’s going to pay for itself,” said Jason J. Russell, who oversees employee compensation and benefits for SAP North America. And, he added, “You are creating good will with employees.”

Given the expense of screening more people of average risk — as well as follow-up costs from additional tests, medicines, surgery and potential complications from surgeries — experts said that overall medical expenditures were actually likely to increase. Even so, they said, spending on screening for conditions like hereditary high cholesterol, which increases risk for strokes and heart attacks before the age of 50, could ultimately prolong some lives.

“You are getting good preventive care value for money, ” said David L. Veenstra, a professor at the University of Washington who studies health outcomes and economics.

Color has raised $150 million from venture capital firms like General Catalyst as well as Bay Area tech luminaries including Max Levchin, a PayPal co-founder; Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive; and Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist-investor who is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.

The company has reduced genetic testing costs by using robotics and machine learning and eliminating tasks like in-person prescreening by doctors. It charges $249 for hereditary risk screening for eight of the most common cancers and began offering that price while more established medical diagnostics firms were charging $4,000 for similar tests.

The price point appealed to OpenTable. It started offering genetic screening benefits after an employee with a history of cancers told executives she was spending thousands of dollars out of her own pocket to pay for hereditary risk tests.

“This was a really interesting opportunity to provide some choice to our employees that was accessible and affordable so they could better understand their own personal health,” said Christa Quarles, chief executive of OpenTable.

As for privacy concerns, executives at several companies said that Color regularly sent them aggregated data on the number of employees with harmful disease mutations, but that the data is not tied to identifying details like employees’ names or birth dates.

As more large-scale research is conducted, medical recommendations may change. More than 150,000 patients, for instance, have enrolled in a DNA sequencing study at Geisinger Health, a medical center in Danville, Pa. And the federal advisory panel is updating its recommendation on genetic screening for certain breast cancer mutations.

Executives at several companies that have signed up with Color said they were aware of the debate over genetic screening, but said they believed the start-up was simply ahead of the curve.

“Over time, innovation becomes consensus science,” said Mr. Russell of SAP.The Beijing L.G.B.T. Center said in a post, “We are all gay tonight,” alongside photographs of young men and women. While some posts were censored, the hashtag that translates to #Iamgaynotapervert was viewed more than 1.35 million times.

Many activists had harsh words for Sina Weibo, saying that its attempts to limit free speech had gone too far and that gay people were being punished because their culture was considered out of the mainstream.

“Our whole group went ballistic,” said Zhong Xinyue, 22, an intern at the Canton Rainbow Group, an advocacy organization in the southern city of Guangzhou. She lamented the loss of a popular Weibo account called the Gay Voice, which was deleted on Saturday.

Even People’s Daily, a state-run newspaper, published an article online that included veiled criticism of Weibo’s announcement. The article said that being gay or bisexual was “not a disease,” but it added that gay people needed to “take on their own social responsibilities while advocating their rights.”

Although homosexuality is no longer a crime in China, a conservative culture persists that looks down on people in same-sex relationships. Some textbooks still describe homosexuality as a psychological disorder, and gay characters are rarely shown in movies or on television.

Ma Baoli, the founder of Blued, a popular gay dating app, said the country’s lack of sexual education had exacerbated a culture of intolerance.

“It’s easy to aggravate the public’s discrimination against sexual minorities,” said Mr. Ma, referring to Weibo’s announcement.

Many activists say they are concerned that Mr. Xi’s tightening grip on the internet will dampen a thriving online culture that they say binds the gay community together.

Chen Du, a gay activist in Guangzhou, said Weibo’s campaign would hurt the image of gay people in China and make it more difficult for young people to come out.

“People who are ready to come out are going to be pushed back to where they used to be, faced with pressure and helplessness,” he said.

Under Mr. Xi, internet companies have faced pressure to eliminate content that the government deems unwholesome or pornographic — not just politically sensitive — harking back to the days when the Communist Party was an arbiter of public morality.

Mr. Xi put in place a stricter cybersecurity law last year that has given the state more power to punish and investigate companies that publish content the government labels unsafe or offensive.

“The cybersecurity law is written so broadly that it provides wide latitude for authorities to claim they are acting in the spirit of the law,” said Paul Triolo, who leads global technology policy analysis at Eurasia Group.

This past week, China’s top media regulator ordered Bytedance, a prominent Chinese technology start-up, to shut down an app for sharing jokes and videos, saying it had helped spread vulgar content.In the last three months, Parcast, a little-known podcast network, has introduced three new shows. Each one has shot to the top 10 on the iTunes podcast chart within a week of its premiere .

It’s an unusual feat in an industry where prestige is often characterized by high production values and slow audience growth.

With hundreds of thousands of downloads each, the three Parcast series — “Tales,” “Unexplained Mysteries” and “Female Criminals” — have become some of the more popular new podcasts of 2018.

All owe their success to Max Cutler, 27, a graduate of the University of Arizona’s entrepreneurship program, who created the company in 2016.Photo

LOS ANGELES — True movie stars can “open” a film of any quality simply by having their name above the title. Very few of those specimens remain in this fragmented entertainment age, but Dwayne Johnson proved himself as one over the weekend.

“Rampage,” a PG-13 cheesefest involving mutant animals and marketed squarely around Mr. Johnson’s presence, generated $34.5 million in ticket sales in its North American debut, on the low end of prerelease analyst expectations but enough for No. 1. “Rampage,” which received weak reviews, collected an additional $140 million overseas, according to comScore, which compiles box office data.

New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros., spent at least $220 million to make and market “Rampage” worldwide.

Second place for the weekend went to the hit horror movie “A Quiet Place” (Paramount), which collected a strong $32.6 million, for a two-week domestic total of about $100 million.

“Blumhouse’s Truth or Dare” (Universal), a horror movie that only cost $3.5 million to make, arrived in third place, with stronger-than-expected ticket sales of about $19 million. The turnout is a testament to the Blumhouse brand: “Truth or Dare” received dismal reviews and faced strong competition from “A Quiet Place,” but young moviegoers — especially teenage girls — have come to see Blumhouse as a star in and of itself.

The horror-focused production company, founded by Jason Blum, has delivered one hit after another over the last decade, including “Get Out,” “Split,” “The Visit,” “Happy Death Day,” “Insidious,” “The Purge” and “Paranormal Activity.”But first, I needed coffee.

The closest place I found was Kavasutra in the East Village, a 30-minute subway ride away. (The subway does not accept Bitcoin, so to ride I had to cheat.)

After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn’t work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa’s Facebook account, and then gave up.

But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day.

Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice.

I was invoiced by email for a load of laundry at the Eco Laundry Company in Chelsea. I texted with a hair stylist in Israel who accepted a tip on behalf of his colleague at Armando Piña Hair Salon on the Upper East Side. I waited — fingers crossed — for five minutes before a payment finally posted and I could dig into an ice cream sandwich at Melt Bakery on the Lower East Side.

And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes.

It was fun, until I got hungry.

I had searched for restaurants and grocery stores using Coinmap, the Blockchain Wallet and filters on Yelp, but almost none took Bitcoin, and most said they never had.

“No one is really using it the way it’s supposed to be used, as a currency,” said Dan Sim, who accepts Bitcoin at his Lean Crust pizza shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.

Circa 2013, he said, he’d process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that’s dropped to zero. “People don’t want to part with their Bitcoin,” he said.

I couldn’t find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel.

I headed to Sweetgreen. Its restaurants don’t accept cash, but they still take good old-fashioned plastic.

Here’s what else is happening:

Weather

We’d pay a pretty penny for better weather.

We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning.

Today’s high is around 60. Highs will be in the 50s all week — a little cool for mid-April.

This week in 1912, around 700 people stepped off the Carpathia steamship at Pier 54 in the meatpacking district.

They were the only survivors of the Titanic, which had sunk on April 15, claiming over 1,500 lives.

On the central beam of the pier, you can still read the lettering of the shipping companies “Cunard,” which operated the Carpathia, and “White Star,” which owned the Titanic.

The Titanic left its mark on other places in the city as well.

• Many of the surviving crew members were first received at the Lower Manhattan Seamen’s Friend Society, which was dedicated to improving the “social, moral and religious condition of seamen” and is now the Jane Hotel.

• Memorials to those who perished include Straus Park, a small park at Broadway and 106th Street dedicated to Isidor and Ida Straus; the William T. Stead Memorial in Central Park at 91st Street, honoring a British journalist who died helping others escape; and a plaque for Edith Corse Evans, a New York socialite and one of the few women from first class who died, at Grace Church in Greenwich Village.

• And the white Titanic Memorial Lighthouse, built a year after the tragedy, stood atop the Seamen’s Church Institute until 1967, when it was moved to Titanic Memorial Park near South Street Seaport.

His off-season strength workouts were more straightforward than the hours in the gym players like Syndergaard often spend, and they were carried out among many people older than deGrom at a rehabilitation center in his hometown, DeLand, Fla.

“He’s an elastic, tall and lanky person, so he doesn’t need to hit the gym and get so strong,” Syndergaard said.

And in terms of a diet, well, deGrom’s teammates might best explain his approach to nutrition.

“I’d be 260 pounds if I ate what he eats,” said Jay Bruce, the Mets’ right fielder.

“He can go to McDonald’s,” added Travis d’Arnaud, the Mets’ injured catcher, “get two Big Macs and fries, and stay the same or probably even lose weight.”

Although most pitchers rest their arms during much of the off-season, deGrom plays catch nearly year-round with his father in his childhood backyard. Teammates joke that deGrom could roll out of bed and pitch, while others need hours to prepare their bodies. The day after starts, deGrom’s arm is sprightly enough to fling a football 50 yards.

“If I tried to do that, my arm would go flying with the football,” pitcher Zack Wheeler said, adding with a laugh, “He recovers well and his body treats him right, even though he probably doesn’t treat it right.”

DeGrom does care for his body; he is a professional baseball player, after all, making $7.4 million this season. He just does it a bit differently from many of his teammates. Nonetheless, it has worked.

From the start of 2014, the season in which he won the National League Rookie of the Year Award, to the start of this season, deGrom’s 2.98 earned run average ranked ninth — better than standouts such as Jon Lester of the Chicago Cubs, Stephen Strasburg of the Washington Nationals and Dallas Keuchel of the Houston Astros. He is lauded for his pitching smarts, too, not just throwing hard, and is 2-0 with a 3.06 E.R.A. to start this season.

“Jake’s got a routine that is probably different than 99.9 percent of the guys in here,” the Mets’ captain, David Wright, said. “He gets his work in and prepares, but there are just a few things about him that are offbeat.”

DeGrom was always thin but not tall. As a high school freshman he was 5-foot-2, but he hit a growth spurt at Stetson University, where he was a shortstop with a weak bat. He converted to pitcher before the Mets selected him in the ninth round of the 2010 draft. After struggling to add weight in the past — pitchers often seek more mass to help throw — he gave up. For the past several years, deGrom weighed 183 pounds.

His metabolism has apparently been impervious to all the chicken fingers, fries and fast food he loves, particularly Chick-fil-A and McDonald’s, where he typically orders a Big Mac meal with large fries, a large Mountain Dew and two double cheeseburgers.

“I’ll eat whatever,” he said. “I eat like a child.”

DeGrom said he had been “very fortunate” his diet hadn’t turned him into David Wells or affected his performance.

“If it became a thing, I’d have to cut it back,” he said. “I talk to people and they’re like, ‘Oh, if I eat that, I’ll feel like crap.’ I’ve never eaten McDonald’s and the next day felt terrible.”

The Mets have put an emphasis on health and nutrition after a spate of high-profile injuries undermined last season, but deGrom shows little sign of changing his regimen, which does allow for more sensible choices. Asked if he ate fruits and vegetables, deGrom insisted he did. In the off-season, he said, he and his wife, Stacey, cook steaks or chicken.

Photo

But during the season, many of deGrom’s meals come from the clubhouse dining room, and even then he doesn’t always choose the healthiest option.

“I’m not against eating good foods,” he said, grinning. “I just like to enjoy some McDonald’s every once in a while.”

In the off-season, deGrom worked out at CORA Physical Therapy in his hometown, which, he said, is frequented by older adults and where he underwent rehabilitation from Tommy John and ulnar nerve surgeries. Unlike Syndergaard, who has private trainers, deGrom followed whatever workouts Dustin Clarke, the Mets’ strength and conditioning coach, sent him. He compared his body type to that of Chris Sale, the Boston Red Sox’ hard-throwing ace whose fatty diet belies his 6-foot-6, 180-pound frame.

“We’re more about leverage, and being long and lanky,” deGrom said, adding, “If we were in the weight room like Noah, we’d probably be hurt.”

What also sets deGrom apart is how much he values running sprints and year-round throwing. He noticed that Max Scherzer and Clayton Kershaw, two multiple winners of the Cy Young Award, ran hard sprints in between starts, so he does the same.

In this era of conserving the finite life of the pitching arm, deGrom swears by constant throwing. Over the winter, he fired around 40 throws with his father from shorter distances three times a week.

“When I came into spring, my arm felt great because I kept it moving,” he said. Any other approach feels illogical to him. “You work out and build this muscle, but it’s not used to throwing? You throw that much throughout the year and then you want to stop for two months?”

DeGrom’s approach has worked in the sense that he was the only Mets starter to stay healthy in 2017 and he finished with his first 200-inning campaign. Between starts during the season, he threw two abbreviated bullpen sessions, instead of one longer one, to keep his mechanics sharp. In future off-seasons, deGrom said, he might not rest his arm at all.

There is now also yet another key difference with Syndergaard.

Over the winter, deGrom chopped off his trademark long locks. Fans may have thought he cared a lot about his hair, but when he decided to get rid of it, he asked Wright to trim it in the clubhouse bathroom. Just like that, it was gone. Teammates were not surprised.

“It used to be legs, limbs and hair coming at you, but now it’s legs and limbs,” d’Arnaud said.That’s “La Ronde,” Arthur Schnitzler’s presentation of sex as a daisy chain of erotic encounters that crosses the borders of class and money. In that work (widely known among cinephiles for Max Ophüls’s ravishing 1950 film adaptation), one character from each scene becomes a part of the next, giving unsettlingly fleshly resonance to the idea that we’re all connected.

Ms. Nottage makes deft and fleet-footed use of the Schnitzler prototype of overlapping lives. The production traces the movement of Mlima’s tusks from the elephant’s death through their sale and subsequent smuggling out of Kenya until their final, grim apotheosis as an exquisite ivory set in the penthouse of a rich connoisseur.

Each of the people involved in this sequence of plunder and commerce is played by one of three enjoyable, mutable performers. They are Kevin Mambo, Jojo Gonzalez and Ito Aghayere, who keep reincarnating themselves via quick changes of costume (by Jennifer Moeller), stance and accent.

Those portrayed include the Somali poachers who kill Mlima; the corrupt police chief who first sells the tusks and his unwitting nephew, a park warden; a media-savvy Kenyan bureaucrat; a Chinese businessman; a ship captain; and a master ivory carver. Each character, inhabiting a rung on an ascending ladder of power, is very clearly defined but without grotesque caricature.

Such restraint is appropriate, since Ms. Nottage has not set out to create a gallery of predatory villains. All those involved in Mlima’s slaughter and the sale of his tusks have understandable motives for acting as they do.

Photo

Similarly, even the most seemingly noble among them are ultimately tainted by self-serving motives. It is Ms. Nottage’s point that unconditional virtue is nonexistent within the international system of economic power that keeps the play’s world spinning.

As she demonstrated in her two Pulitzer winners — “Ruined,” about sexual slavery in Congo, and “Sweat,” about blue-collar disaffection in the rust belt of Pennsylvania — Ms. Nottage does deep and conscientious research for her plays. Here, she packs a wealth of cultural, political and economic detail into each scene, from Maasai superstitions to the statistics of the illegal ivory trade.

Yet the facts, figures and folklore never feel jimmied in; the exchange of information among the characters is fluid and always appropriate to the circumstances. If “Mlima’s Tale” is didactic theater, it never comes across as a finger-wagging lecture.

That’s partly because of the arresting visual inventiveness throughout. Riccardo Hernandez’s blank slate of a set is transformed into a globe-circling array of settings by jewel-colored light and shadow (Lap Chi Chu is the whiz of a lighting designer), projected poetic words and saturating, insinuating sound (by Darron L. West, with music written and performed by Justin Hicks).

You’re probably still wondering, though, about Mlima himself and how we are seduced into accepting any actor as a dead elephant. We first see Mr. Ngaujah in stately, trunk-brandishing silhouette against a bright night sky. We hold that initial image in our heads when this figure begins to move, regally and angrily, and to speak in a rich, sensory language of his world and his past as he perceives them.

“If you really listen,” he says, “our entire history is on the wind.” His future, too, becomes elementally pervasive, as Mr. Ngaujah shows up as a living shadow in every subsequent scene. Most disturbingly, we see him alone in the cargo hold of a ship, inevitably summoning thoughts of African people of earlier years abducted into barbaric slavery.

After Mlima’s death, Mr. Ngaujah smears his torso and face with white paint, evoking the ritual body painting of African tribes. That paint has a way of transferring itself, as an emblem of complicity, onto everyone with whom Mlima comes in contact. Don’t be surprised if at the end of this transfixing show, you find yourself checking your own clothes for remnants of the same substance.Noam Chomsky

Photo

After arriving at M.I.T., Mr. Reyes met with Mr. Chomsky to float the idea of a puppet play riffing on his criticisms of artificial intelligence research and the social impact of technology. As a prop/ambassador, Mr. Reyes brought along a puppet of Leon Trotsky, from his 2014 play “The Permanent Revolution.”

“He said: ‘Oh that’s nice. But where is Rosa Luxemburg?’” Mr. Reyes recalled. “As it turns out, I also have a puppet of Rosa Luxemburg, so I put her in the show too.”

Mr. Chomsky, Mr. Reyes said, approved a synopsis of the play (whose title riffs on “Manufacturing Consent,” his 1988 book with Edward S. Herman). As for his puppet likeness, which (like the others) was made in Japan by master puppet-makers in the Bunraku tradition, “he was pleased with it,” Mr. Reyes said. (Mr. Chomsky didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

Elon Musk

Photo

The show features a cameo by an undead Steve Jobs, who pipes up, like a clueless Alexa, when a character mentions the impact of automation on “jobs.” But the real skewering is reserved for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder who wants to send humans to Mars.

In the play, Mr. Musk (who in real life has called for government regulation of artificial intelligence, even as his start-up Neuralink aims to build a brain-computer interface) has enlisted Mr. Chomsky as a reluctant judge in a contest to select “The Terrifying New Gadget Which Might Kill Us All.” To Mr. Reyes, Mr. Musk is the kind of visionary who ignores the more basic needs of the broad mass of humanity.

“The very idea of going to Mars may capture people’s imagination but it’s something that is only accessible to superrich,” he said. “There’s nothing up there anyway. Mars is kind of a boring rock.”

Ayn Rand

About halfway through the play, Musk puts a copy of “Atlas Shrugged” into the Print-a-Friend, and out pops Ayn Rand, wearing the signature dollar-sign pin she favored in real life.

Mr. Reyes read Rand’s novel “The Fountainhead” as a teenager, but unsurprisingly is not a fan, though he said he appreciates her theatrical qualities.

“She’s a great character for comedy because she’s a sociopath,” he said. “There are so many very crazy things she said.”

Karl Marx

Photo

Mr. Chomsky may be the hero of the play, but it’s Karl Marx who bats intellectual cleanup, with a 21st-century rap update of “The Communist Manifesto” that somehow rhymes “Tannenbaum” with “Amazon.”

The Marx puppet has appeared (with Adam Smith) in a series of short buddy videos and in “The Permanent Revolution,” alongside Lenin, Trotsky, Frida Kahlo, Julian Assange and others.

“Very naïvely, I had this goal of creating a certain literacy though entertainment,” Mr. Reyes said. “After I became a parent I found myself wondering, if kids can learn 300 names of Pokémon and ‘Star Wars’ characters, why not some history?”There’s a great world next door. Let’s go.

The search for alien worlds and perhaps alien life will take another step outward on Monday when TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is launched into orbit around the Earth. TESS will spend at least two years scrutinizing the entire sky for exoplanets — planets around other stars — within about 300 light years from here. The worlds next door.

When is the launch and how can I watch it?

The launch is presently scheduled for 6:32.07 p.m. EDT on Monday. It can viewed on NASA’s website nasa.gov/live, with live coverage scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.

SpaceX, whose rocket will carry TESS into space, anticipated favorable weather conditions for the launch.

Why is the TESS mission important?

Over the last 30 years, astronomers on Earth and in space, using instruments like the Kepler spacecraft, have discovered 4,000 exoplanets, most of them far, far away. The galaxy, they now think, has more planets than stars in it. TESS will find the closest of these planets to Earth, pinpointing targets for the next generation of telescopes, like the James Webb Space Telescope, in space to study for clues to their habitability or even inhabitants.

TESS is sponsored by NASA, as part of its small Astrophysics Explorer missions. The spacecraft was designed by a collaboration led by George Ricker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and built by Orbital ATK of Dulles, Va. It will be launched in a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.“I never said anything that made headlines,” he told Basketball Digest in 1980. “Nothing colorful.”

“We called Greer bulldog because he had that kind of expression on his face, and it never changed,” his former teammate Al Bianchi told Terry Pluto in the oral history “Tall Tales” (1992).

But in his 15 N.B.A. seasons, with the Syracuse Nationals and their successor franchise, the 76ers, Greer turned in an outstanding game just about every night.

Photo

Earl Monroe, who faced Greer while playing for the Baltimore Bullets and the Knicks, recalled how Greer would pile up points in an unspectacular but devastating way.

“He would have 25 or 30 points on you, and you’d be wondering what he did to get all those points,” Monroe recalled in “Earl the Pearl” (2013, with Quincy Troupe). “Every night, steady. You knew he would be going to pull up and shoot the jumper, but you were never ready for it.”

Averaging more than 20 points a game in eight seasons, Greer was an N.B.A. All-Star from 1961 to 1970, and he was named to the all-league second team seven times.

He was voted most valuable player of the 1968 All-Star Game, scoring a record 19 points in a single quarter. He was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1982 and named to the N.B.A.’s 50th anniversary team in 1996.

Greer averaged 22.1 points a game on the 76ers’ 1967 championship squad, playing alongside Wilt Chamberlain at center, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Billy Cunningham at forward, and Larry Costello and Wally (later Wali) Jones in the backcourt.

The 76ers, coached by Alex Hannum, were 68-13 in the regular season, then eliminated the Bill Russell-led Celtics from the playoffs with a 4-games-to-1 victory in the Eastern Division finals, ending Boston’s streak of eight consecutive N.B.A. titles. Philadelphia won the finals over the San Francisco Warriors in six games.

Greer averaged nearly 28 points a game in the 76ers’ 15 playoff games.

Cunningham long remembered Greer’s one-handed jumper, fired from up to 20 feet out, usually from the top of the foul circle. As he told Hoop magazine in 2006, it was “as good as anybody’s who ever played the game.”

Greer was also adept at penetrating to the basket, and he was an outstanding defensive player. He shot free throws effectively while mimicking his jump-shooting form.

“I would like to be remembered as a great, consistent player,” he once told The Philadelphia Daily News.

Harold Everett Greer was born on June 26, 1936, in Huntington, W. Va., where his father, William, was a railroad worker. After starring at the segregated Frederick Douglass High School there, he became the first high-profile black player at a major college in West Virginia, averaging more than 19 points a game for Marshall College (now Marshall University) in Huntington.

Earl Lloyd, the first black player in the N.B.A., with the Washington Capitols in 1950, played at the historically black West Virginia State.

The Syracuse Nationals selected Greer in the second round of the 1958 N.B.A. draft. “I didn’t think I had a chance at all,” he once said. “When I first got there, I didn’t even unpack my bag.”

But Greer went on to team with the outstanding front-count scorers Dolph Schayes, Johnny Kerr and George Yardley and played five seasons for the Nationals before they became the Philadelphia 76ers, after the Philadelphia Warriors had moved to San Francisco.

Although Greer enjoyed his greatest success with the 76ers, there were some low points as well.

With 5 seconds left in Game 7 of the 1965 Eastern Division finals and the 76ers trailing the Celtics by 1 point, Greer inbounded the ball. His high, soft toss to Walker was deflected by Boston’s John Havlicek as the Celtic broadcaster Johnny Most memorably screamed: “Havlicek stole the ball! It’s all over!”

“I didn’t put enough on the ball,” Greer told The Boston Globe afterward.

In his final season, Greer was a substitute on a famously awful team, the 1972-73 Sixers, who went 9-73.

Over his career he scored 21,586 points for an average of 19.2 a game and played in 1,122 games, an N.B.A. record at the time of his retirement.

He owned a marketing company after leaving basketball.

He and his wife, Mayme, had two daughters, Cherie and Kelly, and a son, Hal Jr. The 76ers said all survive him.

Greer may have been a steady and quiet sort, but one night in the fall of 1967 he showed a thing or two to a Knicks rookie who would come to epitomize flash.

“He was one of my heroes, probably my favorite player,” Walt Frazier wrote in recalling his first preseason appearance in “The Game Within the Game” (2006, with Dan Markowitz). “But that night he just killed me. He beat me off the dribble, he pulled up for 15-foot jumpers. When the locker room cleared out, I sat down and cried. I really didn’t think I had what it took to make it in the N.B.A.”Photo

R. Lee Ermey, a former Marine whose barking, foulmouthed drill instructor in Stanley Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket” highlighted a decades-long career in which he frequently portrayed authority figures, died on Sunday morning in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 74.

His longtime manager, Bill Rogin, said the cause was complications of pneumonia.

Mr. Ermey, who was nicknamed the Gunny, earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor with his performance as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in “Full Metal Jacket,” released in 1987.

In a memorable opening monologue, Mr. Ermey’s character berates fear-stricken military recruits, hurling an avalanche of verbal insults that are both inventive and demeaning. His eyes bulging and his jaw square, he renames one recruit “Private Snowball,” knees another in the groin and chokes a third to stop him from smiling.

Later in the film, Mr. Ermey’s character admonishes a recruit, asking rhetorically in a now famous line: “What is your major malfunction?”

Photo

Mr. Ermey, whose dozens of acting credits included film and television roles, was also well-known for playing Sheriff Hoyt in the 2003 horror film “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” He notably portrayed a police captain in the 1995 crime drama “Se7en,” and was the voice of a green plastic solder named Sarge in the “Toy Story” franchise.

Ronald Lee Ermey was born on March 24, 1944, in Emporia, Kan., and moved to Washington State at age 11. He enlisted in the Marines immediately after graduating from high school and intended to spend decades in the military.But it wouldn’t be “The Walking Dead” if the lust for violence weren’t fully and generously sated. When Rick and Negan square up beneath the tree, the finishing move is a slash across the neck that certainly looks like a killing blow. It’s the best example of the plentiful non-twist twists littering this season, an unusually well-executed pseudo-execution.

The basic function of that bait-and-switch may be similar to, say, Henry’s implied death and surprise return. But where that particular narrative decision generated pathos (and rewrote Henry’s personality, just when he was growing into one of the show’s more conflicted characters — see him this week, dully pledging to be a good boy), this one has more vindictive, pleasurable results.

The catharsis stemming from the schadenfreude of Negan’s death isn’t canceled out when he survives the day. While the writing may be manipulative, the satisfaction persists because Negan still has to live with his own defeat. Negan must come to terms with the humiliation, with the emasculation, with the undeniable fact that he is the inferior. This is a just fate for him and not a sadistic one, threading a difficult tonal needle.

But aside from brief interludes of happiness — the playful back-and-forth between Ezekiel and Jerry, however short, was one of the episode highlights — the future promises more danger. With Negan effectively neutralized, the show needs a new villain, and this episode hastily whips one up with a rebel faction among the coalition. With Daryl and Maggie concerned about the weakness evident in Rick’s having permitted Negan to live, they agree that Rick must be stopped.

This isn’t the first time there has been a difference of opinion as to how things should be run, however. In the past, members of the coalition have had the presence of mind to talk out their differences and continue working toward a common good. The question of why Daryl and Maggie would now play saboteurs instead of directly approaching Rick nags at a viewer as the season winds up.

And as the final credits roll on another season, a larger picture coheres. The minutiae of the “All-Out War” story line were often frustrating week to week, with characters used as tools for easy drama, interrupting their developmental arcs. But considered as a whole, this season’s hard-nosed inquisition into the cost of long-term conflict stands up to scrutiny. The ideas weren’t always well expressed, and yet the perspectives the season offered on the personal compromises that members of militarized groups must make for the sake of a mission have value.

Those intrepid viewers still on board with the show are made to trek through miles of carnage every week; mercifully, at the end, there’s hard-won insight waiting for them.

A Few Thoughts While We Survey the Wreckage:

• Eugene remains a wordsmith of great intellect and silliness, speaking to those around him primarily as a form of amusement for himself. He explains his turncoat scheme to manufacture defective bullets with the elegant turn of phrase, “a modicum of phooey for a full kablooey.”

• Jadis mentions to Morgan that her real name is Anne, conjuring memories of Ezekiel’s full reinvention in this season’s fourth episode, “Some Guy.” The zombie apocalypse brought more strife than anyone had imagined possible, but for a select unmoored few, it was a precious opportunity.

• During this evening’s commercial breaks, AMC raised quite a ruckus over Morgan’s migration from “The Walking Dead” proper to its spinoff, “Fear the Walking Dead.” Having bested his budding schizophrenia, Morgan is probably ready for a change of setting. And yet his departure leaves something to be desired. For a show so dogged in its creating a sense of momentousness for every plot twist, the episode’s big loss lands rather unceremoniously.

• The 10-second countdown in the climactic fight between Rick and Negan doesn’t amplify the tension as much as it does break the scene’s rhythm to create a new one. That false step aside, there’s a clear sense of forethought to the mise-en-scène; the quietly poetic quality to the open field, the tree and the delicate stained-glass panes hanging from it evoke old samurai films.The fantastically fraught kiss wouldn’t be half as effective without the skillful acting of Paul Giamatti and Jeffrey DeMunn. DeMunn has never had a better showcase on “Billions” than he has in this episode, from the nude scene in which he drops trou to intimidate Connerty during a locker-room conversation (eat your heart out, Sophocles) to his complex performance of pride, gratitude, love and secret rage bubbling as Chuck makes a surprise appearance to present him with an award at his 50th reunion at Yale.

Giamatti, meanwhile, brings out Chuck’s core of kindness and decency — they’re in there somewhere! — when he helps Wendy through the shock of both losing her lover to a deadly rocket crash and discovering that Chuck has known about Heidecker all along. It is during that conversation that Chuck reveals the true story of his first time — and not just his first time having sex. “It was the first time my father ever said he was proud of me,” Chuck says. Charles repeats this rare word of praise just before the kiss; when he pulls away, the trauma radiates from Giamatti’s eyes so strongly you can almost hear it hum.

While I could easily spend an entire review unpacking this one scene, that would do a disservice to the rest of the episode, which moves from strength to strength. Aside from the power struggle between the Rhoadeses, there’s a crisis of conscience for Taylor Mason.

As Axe Capital’s chief investment officer, Taylor bets against Heidecker’s space venture despite deeply admiring the guy and supporting his long-term goal of space colonization. Taylor’s move winds up making Axe Cap a fortune when his rocket explodes, killing both him and his company’s stock value. “You lost a hero and were rewarded for it,” Wendy says during Taylor’s therapy session after the disaster, paraphrasing Taylor’s characteristically wordy and precise description of the issue with her own trademark blunt incisiveness.

How should Taylor resolve this inner conflict? According to Wendy, it’s quite simple, and she sums it up in a sentence that could well be this show’s mantra: “Mind the truth that makes you money.” Taylor, who as a gender-nonbinary person surely has no shortage of experience in resolving conflict to get to the truth beneath, goes out and buys the same obscenely expensive Patek Philippe watch that Heidecker wore — a memento mori in gold, its purchase made affordable by the money the man’s death generated.

Bobby and Wags, meanwhile, are also wrestling with matters of life and death, albeit in very different ways. Bobby spends the episode fighting his ouster from the board of a charity with the beautifully vapid moniker World-Aid, concerned with his potential loss of prestige. But, being Bobby Axelrod, he figures out a way to weaponize his own status as persona non grata and convert his reputational loss into financial gain. Bobby senses the potential in the plans of Oscar Langstraat (the laconic comedian Mike Birbiglia), a “venture philanthropist” (shudder) who wants World-Aid to buy the solar energy company behind the air-conditioning tents the charity is providing to climate-ravaged regions of Africa. The charity’s good name will drive the stock through the roof, which will enrich the charity in turn.

After ordering Taylor to surreptitiously snap up stock for Axe Cap, Bobby spends his final board meeting ranting and raving about how stupid the idea is, knowing that the board hates him so much they’ll approve the deal just to spite him. Once again, human misery is converted to currency by players canny and amoral enough to see the play and make it.

Wags’s story line provides a comedic counterpoint to those of Taylor and Bobby. He’s on a mission to buy the last burial plot on the entire island of Manhattan — yours for the low, low price of $350,000! — which requires outmaneuvering a wealthy and profane personal-injury attorney played by Michael Kostroff, best known as the similarly sleazy lawyer Maurice Levy on “The Wire,” whose delight in playing these kinds of creeps is evident in every single line reading.

A little blackmail, a well-placed item about the lawyer’s mistress on Page Six, and boom, Wags’s eternal resting place is secured. He and Bobby meet in the graveyard and have a killer exchange about the different ways death is spoken of depending on the age of the deceased. Dying in your thirties or forties? “Tragic.” Fifties? “Such a shame.” Sixties? “Too soon.” Seventies? “A good run.” Eighties? “A life well lived.” Nineties? “Hell of a ride.” Wags repeats those last words to himself as he lies down on the grave site, gazing up at the sky, not a care in the world.

We should all be so lucky. Or is that so wealthy? On a show like “Billions,” where wealth is wielded like a magic charm, perhaps that’s a distinction without a difference.During the race, jockeys take their lives into their hands. The race involves three clockwise laps around one-third-of-a-mile track and there are tight turns. There have been dozens of serious injuries; videos of spills are all over YouTube. Horses are more vulnerable. More than 50 have died in these races since 1970; animal rights protesters have staged repeated protests. In response, Palio administrators have increased the padding on some turns and instituted other safety controls. Critics say these measures are not enough.

The parade ended and a booming cannon-like shot scattered every bird within two miles. The crowd grew quiet as the horses and their riders entered the piazza. Nine of the 10 racers took up their assigned positions at the starting rope. The 10th rider decided when the race started, when he made a go for it.

While this was happening, the riders conversed, swapped taunts and offered bribes. Impatient horses jostled and reared off the crowded line and were ridden back. The 10th horse made multiple exploratory false starts. This to-ing and fro-ing took more than 10 minutes.

And then they were off. The race was a clattering blur, whipping around us. It took less than 90 seconds but seemed even shorter. Several riders fell from their horses but none were seriously injured.

The winner was La Contrada dell’Onda (the Wave), its colors aquamarine. It was this contrada’s first win since 2013 and its jockey, Carlo Sanna, known as Brigante, was an instant hero, hoisted upon shoulders.

He and his horse, the 9-year-old Porto Alabe, were whisked off to receive the winning banner and be blessed at the Siena Cathedral, the Duomo. This event was not hard to find. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people poured through the streets to make their way there, as the carabinieri kept close watch.

Out came the pacifiers and baby bottles. The winners wept with happiness. Meals commenced at huge tables set up in the streets. The festivities ran all night, which frankly they’d done for the four days leading up to the race, sometimes keeping us awake in our hotel room.

That night we ate pizza margherita, one of Valentina’s Palio-night traditions, at an outdoor table at one of the restaurants that line the piazza. (Tables are hard to come by on Palio night. To watch Valentina secure one in the front row is to witness charm, fortitude and kung fu Italian-language skills in action.) We sat, caught our breaths, drank rehydrating beer over post-Instagram photographs. What else is vacation for?

The pizza was delicious — not so delicious that I’ll forget to remind you that August is also the time to find plentiful and inexpensive white truffles in Siena. Some restaurants have entire wings of their menus devoted to their glory. Dishes come buried beneath them, the way the poutine in Montreal comes covered with cheese curds. Again, I wanted to cry.

I’d heard that truffle dogs could be rented for an afternoon in Siena. I asked my hotel’s concierge about this. He told me yes, they’re 600 euros. I said, “That’s a lot of euros.” He replied: “Do you know what a truffle dog’s time is worth?”

This outdoor loony bin is one I will happily be committed to.For 50 years, Paul Theroux’s addictive novels and brutally honest travel narratives have inspired readers to leave home, travel slow and with a purpose beyond sightseeing. His versatility and boundless curiosity shine in “Figures in a Landscape,” a new collection of essays (to be published on May 8), and in his latest autobiographical novel, “Mother Land” (which will be published in paperback on May 1), where Mr. Theroux takes readers to his beloved Cape Cod and deep inside the Machiavellian world of a large, dysfunctional family run by a scheming matriarch. It’s a deeply revealing and wickedly funny gem that may be the best book ever written about the interpersonal dynamics of a big family. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with him.

Why did you choose to set this novel on Cape Cod?

The Cape is the scene of my childhood happiness. As a traveler, you look for conflicted or misunderstood or little known places — good places to write about. But the place that makes you happy as a child is one you return to — the blue remembered hills, the happy highways of the Housman poem. If you have the opportunity, you go back there to recapture that sense of serenity you had in your childhood. My childhood was late 40s, early 50s — a period when Cape Cod was small and simple. The cottage we rented didn’t have a refrigerator; there was an ice man who delivered blocks of ice for the chest.

I remember the sunshine, the beaches, the smell of the salt marshes. I grew up in Medford [Massachusetts], but my parents moved to the Cape, and I always wanted to come back here. And so, as soon as I had some money, around 1975, when I was living in London, I bought a house on the Cape and I’ve spent every summer here since then.“Wade in the Water” is pinned together by a suite of found poems that employ near-verbatim the letters and statements of African-American Civil War veterans and their families.

These historical poems have a homely, unvarnished sort of grace. One is based on a soldier’s letter — Smith maintains the original spellings — and includes these words:

Sir We the members of Co D of the 55th Massechusetts vols

Call the attention of your Excellency to our case — for instant look & see

that we never was freed yet

Run Right out of Slavery

In to Soldiery & we

hadent nothing atall &

our wifes & mother most all of them

is aperishing all about & we

all are perishing our self

Another found poem is based on survivors’ accounts and journalism about the DuPont company’s dumping of hazardous wastes in Appalachia.

This volume is not entirely a ticket on a doom-bound train. There are poems about the poet’s childhood and her own children. Quotidian delights are sampled. In one, on a long flight, the poet “snuck a wedge of brie, and wept / Through a movie starring Angelina Jolie.”

“Wade in the Water” is Smith’s first collection since “Life on Mars,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012. If this new book lacks some of the range and depth and allusiveness of that earlier book, well, she has battened down certain hatches.

The most memorable lines in “Life on Mars” were perhaps these, and they linger too over Smith’s new book:

The worst thing you can imagine has already

Zipped up its coat and is heading back

Up the road to wherever it came from.

In 2018, you are nobody without an acronym. If Smith, America’s PLOTUS, has a new book out, so does PEONY — that is, the poetry editor of The New Yorker. Kevin Young is still relatively new in that influential position; he is also the director of Harlem’s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

These poets are friends. They attended Harvard two years apart. Young wrote the introduction to Smith’s first book of poems, “The Body’s Question” (2003). They are very different writers.

Young is a maximalist, a putter-inner, an evoker of roiling appetites. As a poet of music and food, his only rival is Charles Simic. His love poems are beautiful and sexy and ecstatic.

He mostly wears his politics lightly but regularly sinks hooks into you that cannot easily be removed. His book of selected poems, “Blue Laws” (2016), is as indispensable as any volume this decade. It is a delivery system for many varieties of complicated and uncomplicated joy.

Young produces so much that his audience can become stupefied. He writes books of cultural criticism, edits anthologies and composes so much poetry that he sometimes issues what he calls outtakes and remixes from earlier work.

Keeping up with him is like trying to keep up with Bob Dylan or Prince in their primes. Even the bootlegs have bootlegs. His manic-impressive productivity can lead to soft spots in his work, which is why “Blue Laws,” a judicious paring down, is so valuable.

Young’s new book, “Brown,” is vital and sophisticated without surpassing anything he’s done before. It’s a solid midcareer statement.

A few of its poems are explicitly political. One is about Trayvon Martin; another is titled “A Brown Atlanta Boy Watches Basketball on West 4th. Meanwhile, Neo-Nazis March on Charlottesville, Virginia.”

Young has long been investigating the lives, art and lingering meanings of black cultural figures. He seems to know everything and everyone. Playlists and bookstore receipts and theater stubs and archive call slips seem to spill from his pockets. Indeed, he once referred to what he called “my magpiety.”

In this book there are excellent poems that name-check or investigate more closely people like Lead Belly, Tracy Chapman, Hank Aaron, the painter Jacob Lawrence and the jazz guitarist Charlie Christian. One poem is titled, after the rapper, “Ode to Ol Dirty Bastard.”

Other poems in this book revisit the author’s childhood in the Midwest: dodgeball games, RC Cola, Atari, wrestling coaches, health teachers and casual and not-so-casual racism.

Young evokes his “baby dreads, tortoiseshells, tight fade.” He cannot help but be a poet of micro-felicities. Watching Arthur Ashe on television, he observes:

Your hair a microphone cover

to help keep

the static down.

“We were black then, about to be / African American,” he writes about his school days, before adding that he and his friends had

given the campus cops the slip

whenever they quizzed or frisked us

for studying while black.

The key to a certain kind of songwriting, it’s been said, is to deliver blues in the verse and gospel in the chorus. There’s not a lot of gospel in these two books — just a strong, wary sense of watching and waiting.Chahuaytire, Peru — Gumercinda Quispe is a descendant of Peruvian Incas and here, high in the Andes, more than 12,500 feet above sea level, she has prepared a nourishing, spicy potato soup, quacha chuño.

She has made it with both fresh potatoes and chuño, the dried, hard white potatoes that are still prepared just a stone’s throw away. The ancient preservation process includes soaking them in an icy stream, stomping them by foot to remove the skins and drying them in the sun.

I love potatoes. They are not a staple in my native India, as they are in Peru. In India, they are a beloved, cheap treat. Cooked in thousands of different ways, almost always creatively burnished with selective spoonfuls from a treasure chest of seasonings and spices, potatoes are served in every town and village at mealtimes and as chutney-augmented street snacks. I wanted to learn more about potatoes here in the land of their birth.

In the little mountain village of Chahuaytire near the town of Pisac in southern Peru, Ms. Quispe and I sat down at a table close to the warm, sooty hearth in the rustic restaurant where she works. The sun was shining bright outside, and the sky was a clear, cold blue.

“Put some sauce in the soup and drink from the bowl,” she said, motioning to the verdant uchucuta sauce she had prepared. “Uchu” means “chiles” in the Quechua language of the Incas, and “cuta” means “ground.”The Alaska is roughly a century old, first appearing in cocktail manuals in the 1910s. How the drink got its name is not known, but Alaska was a hot news topic then, becoming a United States territory in 1912. Also, the drink is golden, like the ore famously mined there during many rushes.

Never terribly renowned, the Alaska nonetheless became one of the “forgotten classics” celebrated by young cocktail bartenders in the early years of the recent cocktail revival. Its chief attractions were its two main ingredients, gin and yellow Chartreuse, liquors that the new generation of mixologists strenuously championed.

A gin mind-set led Kayla Quigley, the bar and beverage manager at Our Fathers, a new Boston restaurant that serves contemporary Jewish cuisine, to the cocktail. “We knew we wanted this to be a gin bar,” she said. “We knew we wanted to truly elevate the spirit.”

She did this two ways: by stocking more than 90 gins, and by mixing the spirit into a host of cocktails, both celebrated and less so, like the Alaska. “I think people sometimes think gin is useless unless it ends up in a martini or gin and tonic.”

At the Office, the chef Grant Achatz’s speakeasy adjacent to his experimental Aviary bars in Chicago and New York, the drink is served as it might have been in decades past. Both Offices offer vintage cocktails, made with old spirits.

“It’s fun to see how different bottles of yellow Chartreuse play differently, depending on how they aged over the years,” said Micah Melton, the beverage director of the Aviary and the Office.

An important question is what gin to use. Though the drink is usually made with London Dry gin, the earliest known recipe, from 1913, calls for Old Tom gin, a sweeter form of the spirit that was popular in the 19th century, and has recently had a revival. Jim Kearns, an owner of Slowly Shirley in Greenwich Village, favors that version.

“Using Old Tom, the Alaska — which I’d always thought of as a nice, sharp, boozy variant of the martini — had a softness, harmony and complexity that was truly surprising,” he said.

At Our Fathers, there may be one more reason people order the Alaska, and it has nothing to do with how it tastes. “It’s the second cocktail on the list,” Ms. Quigley said. “It’s alphabetical.”

A couple of months after the lawsuit was filed, I paid a visit to the White House to inform Hope Hicks that I wanted to write about Scavino and his value to the president. Hicks was not enthusiastic. The story had already been done, she maintained vaguely, before adding that Scavino was himself unlikely to pull back the curtain any further about his life — and besides, she hastened to assure me, there really wasn’t much of a curtain to pull back. (Scavino declined to be interviewed for this article.) Dan, she said, was simply a selfless public servant who worked tirelessly for the president of the United States. As to his actual value, Hicks offered a curious descriptor I would also hear from several others: Scavino was “the conductor of the Trump Train.”

For those who have forgotten the history of that particular phrase, the “Trump Train” began early in the campaign as a quixotic rallying cry. At the time, Trump’s presidential ambitions seemed like a populist burlesque rather than anything that could seriously be called a political movement. But the reality-TV star’s fan base continued to grow, in defiance of polling and Beltway groupthink and in direct proportion (or so it seemed) to his mounting pile of scandals and outré policy proposals. The Trump Train, it soon became clear, was a juggernaut, and before long the phrase became second only to “Make America Great Again” as Trump fans’ most cherished meme.

In hindsight, the phrase’s rise is also a good illustration of why Scavino, as the behind-the-scenes cheerleader and relentless documentarian of the Trump movement, deserves significant credit for its success. Perhaps the most profound effect of Scavino’s countless iPhone videos and photos is that they served as proof to so-called “shy Trump supporters” that they were not alone — that they were in fact (regardless of what the mainstream media reported) poised to make history. As Jason Miller, the campaign’s senior communications adviser, puts it: “You could make the case that without Dan fulfilling his core mission of conveying the excitement, people wouldn’t have realized that they were part of a movement. It was absolutely critical in encouraging people to turn out.”

But now that they had turned out for Trump and he was America’s 45th president, what did he still need Scavino for? I spent the next six months trying to find out, even as the ranks of “originals” dwindled. Keith Schiller left in September. Soon after Hope Hicks exited the building on March 29, Scavino — now the longest-tenured Trump employee in the White House — took over her office, just outside the Oval. By these measures, he was one of the most powerful people in Washington, despite the fact that no one could explain what Scavino did for a living.

Back in November 2013, before Twitter had fully transformed into the cesspool of outrage and vitriol it is today, a 37-year-old man named Dan Scavino decided to post his own contribution to a trending hashtag, #MentionSomeoneYoureThankfulFor.

“Simple!” he wrote. “I would not be where I am today w/o him. Thank you @realDonaldTrump!!”

Scavino was then leading the placid life of a suburban striver. Together with his wife of 13 years, their two sons and two Portuguese water dogs, he lived in a four-bedroom house in Dutchess County, N.Y., looking out onto the sixth hole of the neighborhood golf course. An English schoolteacher’s son, he had played tight end and defensive end on his high school football team the year they won state and had kissed the ring of Pope John Paul II. He had in fact twice finagled front-row seats to see the pope, just as he had talked his way into a sales job at Coca-Cola while polishing the company president’s golf clubs during his summer employment as a caddy. His genial hustling had earned him minor celebrity upstate: Scavino frequently dropped in on the studio of the K104.7 “Woodman in the Morning” radio show, and as a philanthropically minded Catholic, he could be counted on to judge a charity cupcake contest and to walk the runway in a “Best Legs in the Hudson Valley” competition.

But what propelled Scavino’s ascent more than any other factor was his relationship with Donald Trump. The two first met in 1990, when Scavino was a teenage caddy at a Westchester County course that Trump would eventually purchase and rename the Trump National Golf Club. Scavino carried Trump’s clubs, earning a $200 tip from the developer — who later in the club’s Grille Room told the caddy, “You are going to work for me one day.”

Scavino went on to major in communications at the State University of New York in Plattsburgh; he did a six-month internship at Walt Disney World, then later got a job with the Texas-based Galderma Laboratories as a pharmaceutical rep; he married and settled down. But throughout it all, he held onto the two hundred-dollar bills that Trump had given him. When that same Westchester golf club, which now bore the billionaire’s name, offered Scavino a job as an assistant manager in 2004, he accepted. Four years later, he was the club’s general manager, whizzing around America in the big man’s private plane. After a brief and not altogether successful stint running his own consulting firm, Scavino reached out to Trump’s son Eric in November 2014 to see if he could come back into the fold. On Nov. 8, having heard the rumors of a possible presidential bid, Scavino buttonholed his old boss at Eric’s wedding and said, “When you run, I’m in.”

What Scavino was offering were the services of a registered independent who had no experience in politics. He had only one qualification: He was a Trump die-hard. Lewandowski hired him on the spot. In June 2015, the two men, along with Hicks and the political adviser Sam Nunberg, moved into a cramped office on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. Scavino’s first assignment was to try to find big-ticket contributors to Trump’s campaign, an effort that proved fruitless, as the Republican donor class did not take his candidacy seriously. Scavino would later be enjoined to cultivate relationships within the Republican National Committee, which at that time viewed the bombastic New York businessman and reality-TV star with eye-rolling skepticism. He had no luck with that effort either.

A more suitable job for Scavino materialized shortly after Trump’s formal announcement of his candidacy on June 16, 2015. The campaign had been trying to curry favor with the powerful publisher Joe McQuaid, whose endorsement in The New Hampshire Union Leader was among the most highly coveted in the early primary states. But this charm offensive threatened to come undone when, during Ivanka Trump’s visit on June 24 to announce the opening of a campaign office in Manchester, McQuaid’s daughter was unable to get her photo taken with the socialite. Trump was infuriated when he learned of this. To prevent similar dust-ups in the future, Scavino had another duty added to his portfolio: going to the early primary states to tend to the needs of the local kingmakers.

In this new role, as with so many of his roles for Trump over the years, Scavino continued to serve as a kind of caddy. He went on food runs for the candidate to McDonald’s and KFC. He faithfully typed out Trump’s tweets as the candidate dictated them. He also wandered the events, climbed the rafters and snapped smartphone pictures, which he then posted on both his and the campaign’s various social-media accounts. It happened that the campaign already had a professional photographer on the payroll. But this was becoming a liability, in that she tended to take hundreds of images at each event, and the candidate would insist on spending hours of valuable time poring over every last one of them. The campaign did nominally have a social media specialist — Justin McConney, son of the Trump Organization’s controller — but he lacked Scavino’s instinct for the base, and in any event, McConney was stationed back at Trump Tower, away from the real action on the campaign trail. By early 2016, Scavino had become in essence both the Trump campaign’s traveling photographer and its social media chieftain. And because the self-funding candidate had no intention of spending a dime on media coverage, Scavino with his Facebook videography also became the closest thing the Trump campaign had to an in-house ad maker.

Scavino’s willingness to take on other people’s online grunt work made him indispensable to the campaign. Early in the primary, the candidate’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, argued to Trump that Facebook was much more powerful than his preferred platform, Twitter. “Every Facebook user is probably worth 10 to 12 times more than one of your Twitter followers,” Kushner told him. “And look, I think your Facebook page is totally underutilized.” The candidate responded, “Congratulations, then — you’re now in charge of my Facebook.” Kushner turned around and handed over that job to Scavino.

Even as Scavino’s deployment of campaign imagery onto Facebook helped accelerate the Trump Train, it was Twitter, with its visceral impact, that remained Trump’s abiding love. “Somebody said I’m the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters,” he crowed during an event in South Carolina in November 2015. (The “somebody” was most likely one of his employees.) On his plane or in limousines, he would dictate tweets for Scavino to post. Others, including Scavino, would goad Trump with their own suggestions. (Hope Hicks would supply the choicest put-downs, recalls a former campaign official: “She’d have absolute daggers.”) Trump would give his missive a final read to make sure that it had not been watered down, and Scavino would hit “Tweet.”

Now and again, Trump would enlist Scavino — whose followers today exceed 475,000 — to act as a proxy, attacking the campaign’s enemies from his own account. At other times, Scavino took the initiative himself. Before long, the personal feed that had once been a totem of cornball folksiness included harsh attacks on Megyn Kelly, “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz and other perceived antagonists. In March 2016, Scavino retweeted a conspiracy video purporting to demonstrate that Cruz was having an affair with a former aide, Amanda Carpenter. Carpenter, who is married with children, went on the air and heatedly denied any impropriety. She also condemned Scavino by name, calling his attack a “smear job.”

“It was a campaign, and they fight dirty, and they didn’t mind if I was collateral damage in the process,” Carpenter told me. “And they won. And no consequences. What Scavino did to me and what he still does to others would get any other professional fired. In Trump’s universe, it’s a qualification. A willingness to engage in lies and smears on behalf of Donald Trump is a sign of loyalty that Trump treasures.”

“It’s so great that I have Twitter now, because I can knock the crap out of people,” Donald Trump told me one afternoon in late March 2016 at his South Florida country club Mar-a-Lago. “I have my own printing press now!” he added with Falstaffian relish.

Still, nothing in Trump’s earliest social media forays would prefigure the towering role that Twitter eventually played in his political branding. Trump opened his @realDonaldTrump account in March 2009, only to ignore it for the better part of two years. Giving in to the urging of his political advisers Roger Stone and Sam Nunberg, Trump began to tweet about his hotel properties and his TV show. Soon he offered up sundry nuggets on his importance to the Yankees (“They always win when I am there”) and on how to succeed in life (“Show me someone without an ego, and I’ll show you a loser”). Like a fading matinee idol, Trump had an embarrassing tendency to preen, particularly once his musings turned to politics, around the run-up to the 2012 election. “My daughter Ivanka thinks I should run for president,” he tweeted on Jan. 25 of that year. “Maybe I should listen.” (“He’d be phenomenal!” Ivanka exclaimed in the linked Hollywood Life article.)

Of course, at that point the microblogging platform played a marginal-at-best role in American political life, even less so in presidential politics. Barack Obama was a reluctant pioneer in this regard. Tweets from his @POTUS account would undergo a policy and legal vetting process, and it could sometimes take days or even weeks before they were finally posted. The thought of using Twitter as a political cudgel “would have been completely against our values,” says Macon Phillips, Obama’s first digital director. “I think I would have left. I think a lot of us would have.”

At the time he announced his candidacy in the summer of 2015, Trump himself was unsure of the role Twitter would play in his campaign. His tweets then seemed to demonstrate only the fundamental unseriousness of his presidential ambitions. As the campaign wore on, however, the candidate’s online disparagements no longer suggested a man bent on self-immolation. Rather, they reinforced the campaign talking point that here, at long last, was an honest politician who did not bother to conceal his lesser angels. His incessant howling of personal grievance only helped to show that the aloof titan of Fifth Avenue, mythologized in “The Apprentice,” had a tender underbelly. In baring his smallness, the billionaire New York developer managed to collapse the differences between his gilded life and that of white Middle America.

Today Trump has not so much drained Washington’s swamp as convulsed it with daily electroshocks of presidential id. Journalists now routinely awaken to the sound of a notification on their smartphones, telling them that the president is already up and driving the news in 280-character gonzo fusillades. A far more common spectacle today than a legislative signing ceremony is the image of House Speaker Paul Ryan facing the microphones and, with a mortician’s smile, trying to explain away his party leader’s latest tweet: “It’s what he does. We’ve kind of learned to live with it.” (Or maybe not: Ryan made it less than halfway through Trump’s first term before announcing his retirement from Congress.) The question of whether Trump’s social media outbursts constitute actual news has been rendered moot by his front-page-worthy announcements on Twitter: that his secretary of Veterans Affairs has been replaced, that he considers his own attorney general “beleaguered,” that “trade wars are good,” that “DACA is dead.” The Trump presidency’s defining feature — its resolute abnormality — is above all the handiwork of @realDonaldTrump. It therefore stands to reason that Trump’s most valued aide is the one whose job description has no precedent.

Scavino’s importance to the president certainly helps explain how he has managed to survive a succession of internecine bloodlettings in the West Wing. But it’s also the case that he is well liked among his colleagues, several of whom offered to help me understand his intrinsic value. Typically such efforts descended into cliché: “I’ve never met anyone who’s as hard-working or as loyal.” “The one guy who outworked me.” “The president has zero concern that Dan has any interest in anything but serving him.” “You never see Dan out there hogging the limelight.” One senior White House official told me that the president trusts Scavino when it comes to personnel decisions. “Dan’s a very good judge of people,” he told me. When I asked if he could supply me with any examples of Scavino’s advice-giving, the official replied coolly, “Absolutely not.” But one longtime friend of Scavino’s offered an illuminating analogy. “Golf is a sport of the least mistakes,” he said. “That’s how someone like Dan might float to the top — by not doing anything wrong.”

One of Scavino’s main roles is the care and feeding of his boss’s ego. He has learned how to fend off any negativity with a ready supply of superlatives. While Hope Hicks would inform Trump about how some matter might be playing in the mainstream media, Scavino, Hicks told me, would “tell him how things are playing with his people. That’s a gauge for him that the president takes seriously.” Checking in with the base is as easy as looking at his phone. Scavino’s old friend offered an example: “Dan would scroll through his Twitter feed and if Franklin Graham says something particularly complimentary, he’ll say, ‘Look what Franklin Graham just wrote.’ Or if [CNN show host] Brian Stelter says something particularly stupid, he’ll run over and say, ‘Look what Fake News is doing.’ ”

More than anyone else in the White House, the director of social media spends his day online, monitoring the #MAGA congregation. “Dan talks to the base more than anybody else after the president,” one senior White House official told me. “He’s the conductor of the Trump Train, and these people know he’s true blue, and he also knows all the influencers.” A year ago, the former chief strategist Steve Bannon shared a West Wing office with Scavino. “He has his hands on the Pepes,” Bannon recalls, referring to the cartoon frog that serves as mascot to the alt-right. “He knew who the players were and who were not. He’d bring me Cernovich — I didn’t know who Cernovich was until Scavino told me.” Bannon was referring to the alt-right blogger Mike Cernovich, who has frequently promoted debunked and scurrilous conspiracy theories.

When I asked Cernovich about his relationship with Scavino, he claimed they had none. “No, never met him, never emailed with him, never D.M.’ed with him, and I don’t think he’s ever tweeted at me,” Cernovich said. In fact, by Cernovich’s standards, the Trump social media director was something of a lightweight. “Scavino’s not an ideologue,” he said disapprovingly. “I don’t think he wakes up and says, ‘Holy hell, I want to break things today — who do I go after?’ It’s more, ‘I like my job and the Trump family.’ ” Still, Cernovich acknowledged that Scavino had most likely served as a conduit between the alt-right and Trump, if only through his eagerness to bring passionate fans to his boss’s attention.

Since arriving in the nation’s capital, Scavino has kept attacking President Trump’s opponents from his own Twitter account: Nancy Pelosi, Bill Kristol, Kathy Griffin. Last April, he went after Justin Amash, a Republican congressman from Michigan and frequent critic of Trump. Calling Amash “a big liability,” Scavino’s tweet urged, “#TrumpTrain, defeat him in primary.” Not easily intimidated, Amash replied, “Bring it on.” But what instead was brought on was an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, which concluded that Scavino had violated the Hatch Act, the law that forbids engaging in political activity while acting in your capacity as a government employee. On June 5, the O.S.C. disclosed that it had put Scavino on notice. Though its statement made clear that future violations could result in harsher punishment, it neglected to say that only one individual could mete out that punishment: the president of the United States.

The full extent of Scavino’s role in Trump’s Twitter regimen has never been fully disclosed. White House officials initially maintained to me that he only typed and posted verbatim what Trump dictated to him, while occasionally contributing anodyne tweets relating to the president’s schedule. (“News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill. 1:00 P.M.”) Somewhat begrudgingly, one senior official did not deny that Scavino also sometimes corrected Trump’s spelling errors. But the Knight Institute lawsuit had named Scavino, Hicks and Sanders because, as communications staff members, they are likely to “suggest content” for Trump’s tweets, just as Trump’s subordinates did during the campaign.

In particular, said one individual who witnessed this interactivity on the campaign trail and another who saw it in the White House, Scavino frequently supplied the litany of details in Trump’s tweets about, say, claims of Crooked Hillary’s various malfeasances or of the F.B.I.’s corrupt activity. “Fifty percent of the time, Trump is ripping these out himself, and 50 percent is going to Scavino,” one of them told me.

Evidence of Scavino’s active participation in Trump’s tweets emerged last autumn. On the morning of Oct. 4, Scavino posted to his own account one of the social media director’s usual rants against the media: “NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!” One minute later, the identical message was posted on his boss’s account as an original Trump tweet. Scavino hastily deleted his first tweet, but not before eagle-eyed users took screen shots.

None of this should be so controversial, of course. No one believes that Trump writes the speeches he delivers any more than they believe he wrote “The Art of the Deal.” And in the end, only a fool would suggest that his tweets represent the essence of someone other than Donald J. Trump. All the same, my suggestion to a senior White House official that Trump might have some help in producing his mini-masterpieces was met with heated indignation. I was insulting the president’s capabilities. I was engaging in rank speculation. I was rewriting American history.

Still, the White House official did not once categorically state that Trump was the sole author of every word of his tweets. And in the meantime, Scavino, in the manner of any caddy who knows his place, continually avoided taking credit. He refused to answer even my basic question: What, exactly, did he do?

“When I was a first-year government student,” recalled the former Republican National Committee chairman and Bush strategist Ken Mehlman recently, “one of the first articles we had to read was Norman Mailer’s ‘Superman Comes to the Supermarket,’ which explained how J.F.K. was the man for the television age. It’s very possible that just as Kennedy possessed unique skills for that age, Donald Trump does for the social media age.” With Twitter, Trump has succeeded in subverting the news media, so-called allies and the annoying constraints of human civility. Trump’s oft-repeated vow that he will never stop tweeting may count as his most rational act as president. It may also explain why Scavino could outlast everyone else in the White House.

He has outlasted Hope Hicks, who used to steam the president’s pants, and Keith Schiller, who — as I once witnessed backstage at a campaign event in Buffalo — used to help apply hair product to the postmodern sculpture atop Trump’s head. Managing Trump’s Twitter account, as it turns out, is an even more intimate act, something only Scavino has ever been trusted with. “I told Dan many times during the campaign, ‘Once we win, you’ll have an entire team,’ ” Corey Lewandowski recalls. “I’ve seen him many times since then, and it’s still a one-man operation.”

On a recent Monday in late March, I dropped by the West Wing to have one last in-person visit with some of Scavino’s colleagues and hopefully catch a glimpse of the social media director. The evening before, Yashar Ali of The Huffington Post had broken the news that Scavino’s wife, Jennifer, had filed for divorce several weeks earlier. I had heard rumors of the split from a former White House staff member who, while praising Scavino’s crazed work ethic and fealty to Trump, casually added, “By the way, it also destroyed his marriage.” Scavino had long struggled to balance his ambitions with caring for his wife, who suffers from chronic Lyme disease. That day in the West Wing, he was nowhere to be seen by the time I arrived. Scavino had boarded Air Force One with Trump and flown to Manchester to capture images of the president somberly proposing the death penalty for opioid dealers.

The personal toll of being Trump’s social media director may not end at Scavino’s marriage. Last December, The Washington Post reported that an executive with Vkontakte, Russia’s version of Facebook, had twice emailed Scavino and Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign, offering to promote Trump’s candidacy on the platform. According to an email read to The Post, Scavino’s response to the American intermediary, Rob Goldstone, was effusive: “Please feel free to send me whatever you have. Thank you so much for looking out for Mr. Trump and his presidential campaign.”

A month after the Post story, Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Scavino a four-page letter. Noting media reports that Scavino is a “constant presence at Trump’s side,” Feinstein speculated that Scavino would know about the president’s decision to fire the F.B.I. director James Comey, as well as Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. The senator therefore was writing “to request documents and to schedule an interview with you in January 2018.”

Scavino retained the services of an attorney, who informed Feinstein that Trump’s social media director would not be responding to her requests. Without bipartisan prodding from the Judiciary Committee, and with Trump’s backing, he was free to ignore the Senate inquiry. Still, Scavino’s tweet from November 2013 proved prescient in ways he had not expected: He would not be where he was today without @realDonaldTrump.“We’re at an interesting stage of life,” Ms. Divers said. “We’re both 58. I have much more control over when and how I work. He has less, but he can work here and use it as a home base.”

And now that they no longer have to divide their time between Pittsburgh and Indianapolis, where they used to keep an apartment, they are free to divide it between Pittsburgh and New York. But with two daughters and three grandchildren in Pittsburgh — and a fourth on the way — they didn’t want to leave altogether.

They started looking for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn last November, without strong preferences besides wanting a gas range rather than electric one because they like to cook. But after touring a few new developments, they quickly decided that it would be a shame to miss out on one of the few advantages of New York City housing stock: the ability to live up high.

“We were like, ‘We’re in New York, why go with a place that’s only three or four stories tall?’” Mr. Divers said. “What’s better than looking out the window? We don’t even need to turn on the TV.”

After canceling appointments at lower-rise rentals, the Divers were looking at a nearby building when they noticed The Ashland. They saw an apartment that afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to discover that it was owned and managed by the Gotham Organization. Years earlier, they had rented a Gotham apartment in Midtown West for their youngest daughter, who moved to the city to dance with Alvin Ailey after she graduated from high school.

Names: Kristin and Lou Divers Ages: Both are 58.Occupations: Mr. Divers is an industrial products distributor and Ms. Divers is an artist.Rent: $3,743 a month, after factoring in one month of free rent; amenities are an additional $100 a month.Pittsburgh: The couple, who both grew up there, also raised their family there. They divide their time between Pittsburgh and New York so they can be near all their children and grandchildren; they have two daughters who used to live in New York, but have since moved back. A nice thing about living in New York: “You can get a direct flight anywhere,” said Mr. Divers, who travels frequently to smaller cities in the Midwest and the South for work. They were worried about: Sharing walls again, after an experience with a noisy neighbor in Indianapolis, but are relieved that they have yet to hear any sound from the neighboring apartments. The doormen and desk staff: Were among the reasons they chose 250 Ashland Place. “There’s a good culture in the building, and you can sense it,” Ms. Divers said.They cook at home a lot, but do like going out in the neighborhood: “Our new favorite restaurant is Metta. It’s fantastic,” Mr. Divers said.

“We’d had three or four years before with no complaints,” Ms. Divers said.

They signed a lease for a 30th-floor apartment on a corner, with floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides, paying about $3,850 a month, with access to amenities, after figuring in a rental concession.

While furnishing the place was easy, in theory — they transplanted the contents of their one-bedroom rental in Indianapolis — they found that not all of their furniture was scaled to a New York-size apartment.

“We had to figure out how to fit a 12-foot couch in. We were going around with a tape measure to look at different apartments,” Mr. Divers said. “I was like, ‘I’m not getting a new couch.’”

They did manage to shoehorn the sofa in, but then they had to figure out where they would eat, given that dining rooms are not standard-issue in many New York one-bedrooms. Eventually they settled on a corner of the living room that had room for a high, round table and two tall chairs.

Sometimes they wish they had rented a two-bedroom, but only so they could see their guests: their daughters’ families, who use the apartment frequently whenever the couple is not in residence.

“So many people in our family would love to come and stay with us, but they can only stay when we’re not here,” Mr. Divers said.

Apart from that, sharing a smaller space has presented no issues. “We like each other!” Ms. Divers said.

“The main reason we started renting in Indy was because I got so tired of being in a hotel without her,” Mr. Divers said.

The same philosophy inspired their move to New York. “Having a physical presence in people’s lives makes a big difference — it adds so much,” Ms. Divers said. “I think there’s a patience and appreciation we can have for people when we’re near them.”

“It’s really hard to keep the family thing going,” Mr. Divers added. “People go to college, grow up, move to new cities. Technologies — Skype and all — are nice, but it’s not the same.”

Mr. Divers mused on how much his granddaughter had changed in the first six weeks of her life, a change he was able to witness up close by going over to take care of her, as he did on a recent afternoon so his daughter-in-law could take the dog to the vet.

“When I went over, I put the baby in the front backpack thing and walked up and down the hall to keep her asleep,” Mr. Divers said. “I like helping our kids. How would you do that without being there?”Q: I live on the 15th floor of an Upper East Side co-op with windows facing First Avenue. Pigeons are roosting on my window ledge. The birds’ vocalization is loud enough to wake me up in the morning and they leave behind gray and white stains from their droppings. I shoo the birds away when I’m home, but cannot do this all day. I want to be able to open my window in the spring without worrying that the germs from their droppings will enter my room. What can I place on my window ledge to discourage the pigeons from roosting there? I do not want to use anything that could fall off the ledge, endangering a pedestrian below, or poison the birds. What is a safe remedy?

A: You should be able to open your windows this spring without worrying that a pigeon will fly into your apartment or its droppings will soil your home. While their droppings do not generally pose a serious health risk, they are still unsanitary, and gross. But your building, not you, should get the birds off your ledge. As a shareholder, you are responsible for everything inside the walls of your apartment, and the co-op board is responsible for the building. So the board needs to figure out how to get the birds to find a new home.

“Residents should not attempt a solution on their own,” said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft, a Manhattan property manager.

Write the managing agent and the co-op board a letter alerting them to the pigeon problem and insisting that they fix it. If the birds are nesting on your ledge, they are probably nesting on another resident’s, too. In the letter, ask that management also clean the ledge of any droppings.

The building should be able to get the birds to nest elsewhere without damaging the facade or risking the safety of anyone on the street below. For example, at a Gumley Haft-managed property with a pigeon problem in its inner courtyard, management suspended netting over the area to keep the birds away.

Netting will not solve the problem at your building, but there are other methods. John McGowan, the director of operations for Bugged Out Pest Management in Brooklyn suggested that your building consider using Bird Barrier Optical Gel, a bird deterrent, which he described as “awesome.”Select number of bedrooms Any Beds Studio 1 1 or more 2 2 or more 3 3 or more 4 4 or more 5 5 or more

Spending was lower on hospital outpatient services, including visits to the emergency department that do not lead to hospital admissions. In addition, preventable health conditions and mortality fell.

According to a new report from RTI, a nonprofit research organization, Maryland’s program did not reap savings for the privately insured population (even though inpatient admissions fell for that group). However, the study corroborated the impressive Medicare savings, driven by a drop in hospital admissions. In reaching these findings, the study compared Maryland’s hospitals with analogous ones in other states, which served as stand-ins for what would have happened to Maryland hospitals had global budgeting not been introduced.

But a recent study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, was decidedly less encouraging.

Led by Eric Roberts, a health economist with the University of Pittsburgh, the study examined how Maryland achieved its Medicare savings, using data from 2009-2015. Like RTI’s report, it also compared Maryland hospitals’ experience with that of comparable hospitals elsewhere.

However, unlike the RTI report, Mr. Roberts’s study did not find consistent evidence that changes in hospital use in Maryland could be attributed to global budgeting. His study also examined primary care use. Here, too, it did not find consistent evidence that Maryland differed from elsewhere. Because of the challenges of matching Maryland hospitals to others outside of the state for comparison, the authors took several statistical approaches in reaching their findings. With some approaches, the changes observed in Maryland were comparable to those in other states, raising uncertainty about their cause.

A separate study by the same authors published in Health Affairs analyzed the earlier global budget program for Maryland’s rural hospitals. They were able to use other Maryland hospitals as controls. Still, after three years, they did not find an impact of the program on hospital use or spending.

Changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act, which also passed in 2010, coincide with Maryland’s hospital payment reforms. The A.C.A. included many provisions aimed at reducing spending, and those changes could have led to hospital use and spending in other states on par with those seen in Maryland.

A limitation of Maryland’s approach is that payments to physicians are not included in its global budgets. “Maryland didn’t put the state’s health system on a budget — it only put hospitals on a budget,” said Ateev Mehrotra, the study’s senior author and an associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Slowing health care spending and fostering better coordination requires including physicians who make the day-to-day decisions about how care is delivered.”In a spreadsheet, I noted which pharmacies had it, and which didn’t; which were out of stock and said they could order it; and which ones said they had never carried it. I made note of interesting and surprising quotes. If the pharmacy workers were chatty, I would ask them how often people came in looking for the drug and when they might have sold their last box.

We wanted our examination to be a snapshot of how available the drug was at a particular moment in time, so it was important to get through the list quickly. While Annie reported on people who had gone looking for naloxone, and contacted pharmacy chains, activists and officials, I kept at it.

It didn’t take long to memorize the automated menus at the big chains: “Thank you for calling CVS pharmacy. To refill a prescription, press one…”

Sometimes a single phone call would last long minutes. I would listen to monotonous hold music while a pharmacy worker searched for the drug or asked several others before returning with an answer. I found myself not putting my phone down between calls to save time.

As we went down the list, the possibility that had been suggested by that tip turned into a certainty: We found that only about a third of the pharmacies on the list had naloxone on the shelves and would sell it without a prescription, as the city guidelines had set out.

“Is this an emergency?” a pharmacy worker asked. Another apologized for not carrying it, and told me that I’d have better luck finding it by calling 311 or trying a nonprofit. Yet another told me to check the local police precinct. In a handful of instances, a pharmacy worker would go check the shelf and come back with boxes that were expired — which, prescription or not, could not be sold.

We finished the list and had every pharmacy’s notes in the spreadsheet, divided by borough. Annie highlighted the pharmacies in the ZIP codes with the highest rates of overdose death. Those were the ones we visited.

At about a dozen pharmacies I visited in the Bronx, I got the same answers in person as I had on the phone. The only real difference was that now, there were people who gave me strange looks when they overheard what I was looking for. Some looked concerned, some looked curious and some looked judgmental.

In one instance, I stood off to the side while the pharmacist spent about 10 minutes searching online for New York State’s laws regarding the dispensing of naloxone. He concluded he could sell it to me — if he had any.

The complexity of the issue became more apparent through the reporting. Strewn through what felt like endless phone calls and quick down-to-business conversations, there were nuggets of humanity.

“I understand you just want to feel safe, in case — you know,” said a pharmacist in the East New York section of Brooklyn. “It’s like carrying an EpiPen with you, in case a loved one accidentally ate a peanut.”

After the article was published, Mayor Bill de Blasio was on WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show” for his weekly call, and Mr. Lehrer asked him about our report. When the Mayor and First Lady announced the program in 2015, they promised naloxone would be easy to get at your neighborhood pharmacy. How did he feel about the fact that it was not?

The mayor promised to address the problem “very aggressively.” The city would check on every pharmacy, he said, and regularly monitor pharmacies on the list. The city also announced it would visit as many as 800 independent pharmacies in neighborhoods with high rates of overdose death to make the drug readily available.

Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times.

When I arrived at the Hart Senate Building last Tuesday morning, the first people I saw were the protesters — 20 or so of them, one inexplicably dressed as Spider-Man — who were fanned out beside the entrance, holding photos of the face of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive.

“Zuckerberg, you’re absurd!” they chanted.

I was in Washington to watch Mr. Zuckerberg testify for two days in front of Senate and House committees about Facebook’s privacy breaches, its failure to stop Russian election interference and assorted other misdeeds. And the protesters outside were just the start of the shenanigans. Inside the building, one person attended the hearing dressed in a Russian troll costume. Another group, from the left-wing organization Code Pink, stood up at the beginning of the hearing with signs that read “Stop corporate spying” and “Protect our privacy.” (Perhaps undercutting their message, they also held a sign that read “Like us on Facebook.”)

Friends and colleagues who cover Congress for a living have told me that hearings aren’t always this exciting. But I’m a tech columnist. And in my world, this was the equivalent of a Mayweather-McGregor fight.

I squeezed into a seat in the front row of the press section, just over Mr. Zuckerberg’s right shoulder, and settled in for a marathon session. (You’re not supposed to bring food or drink into these rooms, but I was warned it would be a long session with few breaks, so I smuggled some trail mix in my bag.) My seat was tiny and uncomfortable, with less legroom than your average discount airline. But the hearing itself was fascinating, and I quickly forgot about my discomfort as Mr. Zuckerberg began his testimony with a statement in which he said, “We didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake.”There is a thesis to be written about New York theater of that moment in that dyad of shows, linked by a single actor: Nixon, unwilling to hide the gears turning in her brain with the limbs of her body. By the 1980s, the conventional acting ideology had been absorbed, filed away, and all that mattered was being smart. These actors knew the Meisner-influenced naturalism of New York’s Neighborhood Playhouse and the elegant crispness of the British school, but they grew up in the 1970s when — after President Nixon and Vietnam — nobody believed in any kind of hegemony: American, theatrical or otherwise. So acting transformed in the 1980s into something post-Freudian and hypnotic, like Eric Fischl’s paintings of that moment. Because in that era, being any kind of artist in New York meant you were living through the plague and you were one of its diarists. All shows, from the furthest reaches of the East Village (John Kelly at the Pyramid Club, playing a ravaged Mona Lisa) to the glitzy musicals (“La Cage aux Folles,” starring Gene Barry) had the slight whiff of death. Death was this generation’s teacher.

Disco was dead, Studio 54 had gone cold and Paul Schrader’s “American Gigolo” was the first great film of the decade, starring a young actor, Richard Gere, who had come of age doing Martin Sherman’s “Bent,” a 1979 play about gays killed by Nazis. After “American Gigolo,” the New York theater continued to lend-lease its loosely organized repertory company to the movies: Kathy Bates, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and her husband Samuel L. Jackson, Amanda Plummer, Sarah Jessica Parker and the rest knew how not to be mere tools of the technology — they made the camera adjust to them, to their temperatures, their pickpocket eyes. Nobody more so than Willem Dafoe, who labored quietly and deliberately downtown at the Wooster Group, like Houdini practicing escape acts over and over. Perhaps that’s why, in a 2012 interview, he said, “you do your best things when ... you’re a little scared.” In these years, there was a lot to be scared about.

Cut to 2014, and I am sitting in a restaurant having lunch with an emaciated Nichols, now close to his own end. It was a melancholy meal, and we cheered ourselves up by talking about actors and their tricks. We landed on Nathan Lane, whom we had both worked with often and worshiped unconditionally. I sighed, then asked, “Don’t you love them all, more than anything?” He looked at me, his limpid, quicksilver eyes pooling, and said, “You don’t understand. It’s almost all I have left.”A behind-the-scenes look at how 21 extraordinary theater actors — Sarah Jessica Parker, John Kelly and Kathy Bates among them — came together for a T magazine photo shoot at the LaMaMa Experimental Theatre Club in Manhattan’s East Village and reminisced about their first big breaks.Presented in the Stanford White-designed mansion, Herrera’s first show was a mingling of different worlds and societies — a heady mix that would come to define Manhattan’s creative culture in the ’80s. “The Metropolitan Club didn’t allow men without ties,” recalls Herrera. “Everybody arrived, including Steve Rubell, who was the owner of 54, and they didn’t allow him to go in. So he went to Bergdorf Goodman and bought a tie. And he put on his jacket and said, ‘Here I am.’ And then they let him in.” It was, she acknowledges, a different kind of place to show. And the crowd — buyers, press, artists and the likes of Vreeland, Rubell, Bianca Jagger and a roster of heavyweight New York socialites — felt different, exciting.

Looking at Herrera’s 1981 collection today, the clothes seem the apotheosis of ’80s extravagance. Opulent is the word she uses. “Everything was over the top,” she says. A dress from that show, now part of the collection at Manhattan’s Fashion Institute of Technology, is ecru silk, with puffed sleeves that fluff the upper body to roughly twice its natural width — The New York Times critic John Duka dubbed Herrera’s ruffles “thunderous.”

It was a fashion moment that, unexpectedly, has found itself newly resonant today: Herrera ironically takes her last bow in a season where the hard-edged, wide-shouldered opulence and glamour of the ’80s is re-emerging as a key trend. Even as some of the most talented American designers are opting to present their collections in Paris, not New York, we are harking back to a moment when American fashion came into its own. Echoing the ’80s reminds us of why we got excited about New York fashion in the first place.

Herrera’s final show this year — she is the first designer to hold a runway show at the Museum of Modern Art — links with her debut: the old generation making way for the new; in Herrera’s case, the 31-year-old American designer Wes Gordon. But it also echoes her fundamental ambitions: to celebrate glamour and beauty, even in unglamorous times. “I think to survive in this business you have to believe in something. Make it your own and stay with it,” she says. “If you want to be a designer, you have to be really sure that what you’re doing is what you really believe in. I believe in glamour. I believe in beautiful, elegant women. And I believe women become beautiful when they wear Herrera.”Q: I live on the 15th floor of an Upper East Side co-op with windows facing First Avenue.

While their droppings do not generally pose a serious health risk, they are still unsanitary, and gross. But your building, not you, should get the birds off your ledge. As a shareholder, you are responsible for everything inside the walls of your apartment, and the co-op board is responsible for the building. So the board needs to figure out how to get the birds to find a new home.

“Residents should not attempt a solution on their own,” said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft, a Manhattan property manager.

Write the managing agent and the co-op board a letter alerting them to the pigeon problem and insisting that they fix it. If the birds are nesting on your ledge, they are probably nesting on another resident’s, too. In the letter, ask that management also clean the ledge of any droppings.

The building should be able to get the birds to nest elsewhere without damaging the facade or risking the safety of anyone on the street below. For example, at a Gumley Haft-managed property with a pigeon problem in its inner courtyard, management suspended netting over the area to keep the birds away.

Netting will not solve the problem at your building, but there are other methods. John McGowan, the director of operations for Bugged Out Pest Management in Brooklyn suggested that your building consider using Bird Barrier Optical Gel, a bird deterrent, which he described as “awesome.”Any woman will tell you a vaginal speculum is far from pleasant.

The instrument’s design, which dates back as far as 130 A.D. in Greece with an update in the mid-19th century, has stayed largely the same. That the duck-billed shape of the cold object had remained unchanged was one of the surprises that the photographer Lindsey Beal found in her project, “Parturition,” which documented vintage gynecological and obstetric instruments.

She has traveled over the last two years to medical libraries to photograph speculums, forceps (another early design), syringes, nipple shields and fetoscopes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. She expected to find torture-like instruments — and some were used to experiment on enslaved and poor women — but, instead, she found a common historical thread.

“I thought I was going to look at some really gruesome tools, but I think I was surprised that a lot of them don’t look that different,” Ms. Beal said. “They do resemble a lot of the tools used today.”
