The interview with Mr. Comey and the weekslong media blitz he plans for his book amount to a remarkable public assault on a sitting president by someone who served at the highest levels of power in the government.

The stakes for both men could hardly be higher. Mr. Comey seems likely to be the star witness in any obstruction of justice case brought against the president by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the sprawling Russia investigation. Mr. Trump’s legal fate, as well as his political fortunes in Washington, may depend on whether he succeeds in undermining the credibility of Mr. Comey and the law enforcement institutions he views as arrayed against him.

The ABC interview is Mr. Comey’s first major attempt to prevent that from happening, and in it he speaks with the abandon of a man who finally feels unleashed. But Mr. Comey’s liberation is all the more combustible because it is aimed directly at a president who has said with pride on Twitter that “when someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more.”

As if on cue, hours before the interview aired, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” for the second time in three days, saying in a pair of early-morning tweets that he belongs in jail for what the president said were lies to Congress and leaks of classified information. In another tweet, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey would go down in history as “the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!”

Mr. Comey responded later in the day with a more subtle dig of his own.

“My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others,” he tweeted. “3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint.”

It is unclear where the epic battle of wills will lead, other than to a sustained escalation of insults between two men who have each admitted to having outsize egos. But it is certain to be a test of powerful forces in the modern media landscape: the presidential megaphone, amplified by 50 million Twitter followers, and the global reach of an adversary on a seemingly endless, 24-hour, cable-news-driven book tour.

Parts of the interview that have already been aired suggest that Mr. Comey talks in detail about the interactions he had with Mr. Trump, including meetings and phone calls about which he says he meticulously wrote down notes afterward for posterity. (In another tweet on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Comey’s “‘memos’ are self serving and FAKE!”)

Some of the most startling assertions by Mr. Comey about Mr. Trump in the interview revolve around his first meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower just days before the inauguration. That day, intelligence officials, including Mr. Comey, briefed the incoming president on Russia’s attempt to meddle with the election.

Mr. Comey says in the interview that Mr. Trump and his aides seemed interested only in what the former F.B.I. director called the “P.R. and spin” about the issue.

“The conversation, to my surprise, moved into a P.R. conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this,” Mr. Comey said in a preview of the interview that aired on Sunday morning. “No one, to my recollection, asked: ‘So what’s coming next from the Russians? How might we stop it? What’s the future look like?’”

“It was all, ‘What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had?’” Mr. Comey said.

It was at the end of the meeting that Mr. Comey says in his book that he asked to speak to Mr. Trump alone to brief him on the salacious “Steele dossier,” which contains unverified allegations about Mr. Trump, including a claim that the Russian government has video recordings of him watching prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.

Mr. Comey says in the ABC News interview that Mr. Trump denied the allegations that day, saying, “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” Weeks later, in a telephone call from the president after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed, Mr. Trump again denied the account in graphic terms, Mr. Comey said.

“There’s no way I would let people pee on each other around me,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey’s account in his book. Mr. Comey said the president also raised the idea that the F.B.I. should investigate the claim as a way of proving that it never happened. Mr. Comey said he warned Mr. Trump that doing so would add to “the narrative” that the president was under investigation.

Mr. Comey said in the interview that it was an “out of body” experience to be talking with the incoming president about whether the incident had taken place, or whether the Russians had material they could use to blackmail Mr. Trump.

“I was floating above myself looking down saying you’re sitting here briefing the incoming president of the United States about prostitutes in Moscow,” Mr. Comey says in the interview. Asked whether he believed Mr. Trump’s denials, Mr. Comey said he was not sure.

“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” he said. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”

The president took a break from his attacks on Mr. Comey as he left the White House on a rainy Sunday afternoon to spend time at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. But it seems likely that he and his allies will not back down in the face of Mr. Comey’s barrage of public accusations, which are expected to continue for weeks.

On ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, unloaded on Mr. Comey, calling him a “self-admitted leaker” and a liar.

For his part, Mr. Comey appears unrelenting as well.

In the book, he compares Mr. Trump’s demands for his loyalty to the induction ceremonies favored by Sammy the Bull, the boss of the Cosa Nostra. Holding little back, Mr. Comey argues that Americans in both parties should be wary of the damage Mr. Trump is doing to the country.

“What is happening now is not normal,” he writes. “It is not fake news. It is not O.K.”Photo

For the second time in a week, President Trump on Sunday excoriated the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey in a series of tweets after details from Mr. Comey’s tell-all book were leaked before its official release.

In the latest tirade, which unfolded over an hour, the president declared that Mr. Comey “will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” He mentioned Mr. Comey’s contemporaneous notes of their meetings, calling those memos self-serving and “fake.”

He again called Mr. Comey a “slimeball,” an insult he lobbed on Friday. He also questioned Mr. Comey’s intelligence twice — first by saying the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had been handled “stupidly” and then, about 30 minutes later, that Mr. Comey “is not smart!”

Hours later, Mr. Comey appeared to make an indirect response to the jabs. In a post on on Twitter, he said his book, “A Higher Loyalty,” was about “ethical leadership” and drew not only from his own life but also from “lessons I learned from others.”

Of the three presidents mentioned in the book, two help illustrate “the values at the heart of ethical leadership,” Mr. Comey said, and one “serves as a counterpoint.”

In his tirade, Mr. Trump questioned the integrity of former United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said in a recent interview with NBC News that she did not discuss Hillary Clinton during her meeting with President Bill Clinton in June 2016 on a plane on an airport tarmac. Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server has long been the subject of controversy and that meeting with Mr. Clinton cast a shadow over the federal investigation.So far, officials say, two factors make them wonder whether the facilities were still central to Syria’s program. At this point, there are no known casualties at the sites, which suggests that either no one was there during the evening, or they had been previously abandoned. And there are no reports of chemical agent leakage from the sites, despite attacks by more than 100 sea- and air-launched missiles.

Whether those particular sites were still in use or not, the conflict in Syria has demonstrated a larger truth: While it is easy to blow up Mr. Assad’s chemical facilities, it is also relatively simple for him to reconstitute them elsewhere, or just turn to a commercially available substance like chlorine to make a crude poison that any nation is allowed to possess.

That may explain why General McKenzie was a little more circumspect than his predecessors in forecasting the long-range effectiveness of the latest strikes.

“I would say there’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” he told reporters at the Pentagon on Saturday.

“I believe that we took the heart of it out with the attacks that we accomplished last night,” he continued. But he added that “I’m not going to say that they are going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future.” Instead, he said, he believed that “they’ll think long and hard about it.”

His comment seemed to reflect a central fact: Mr. Assad has learned a lot about how to hide his stockpiles from inspectors. One of the failings of the accord between Russia and the United States that was supposed to rid Syria of chemical arms in 2014 was that it was based on Syria’s “declared” stockpiles, a nuance Mr. Kerry took care to note. There was never confidence that the Russians had succeeded in removing as many weapons stores as they claimed, or in destroying production facilities.

One of the sites struck on Saturday, the Barzeh research and development center, has long been known to American intelligence officials and to international inspectors, according to a senior intelligence official.

Administration officials briefing reporters Saturday afternoon said that equipment at that site and two others — the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility and a nearby “bunker facility” — was destroyed, setting back Mr. Assad’s program by months or years. But they were careful not to claim that the facilities were actively in use at the time of the attack.

“In relation to the Barzeh target, yes, we assessed that there were probably some chemical and nerve agents in that target,” General McKenzie said. Those, however, could have been residual, or long abandoned.

Sophisticated facilities are not needed to produce chlorine, the agent that Syrian forces are suspected to have used a week ago to kill dozens of civilians, including children. It is commercially available, used for water systems. And the nerve agent sarin, which the White House has said may also have been used a week ago, can be produced just about anywhere, as a French intelligence report released on Saturday noted.

The report concludes that “the Syrian military retains expertise from its traditional chemical weapons agent program to both use sarin and produce and deploy chlorine munitions.” The United States, it noted, “also assesses the regime still has chemicals — specifically sarin and chlorine — that it can use in future attacks.”

That is a stark difference from the declarations made in June 2014, when the joint mission between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons trumpeted that Syria or other parties had destroyed, with the exception of a dozen facilities, all “declared production, mixing and filling equipment and munitions, as well as many buildings associated with its declared chemical weapons program.”

Chlorine presents a particular challenge for governments and organizations seeking to control chemical weapons. It is both very lethal and very necessary, and legal to possess in all nations, said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Mr. Knights, who studied the use of chlorine as a weapon by Al Qaeda in Iraq a decade ago, said that the militants used to pair it with explosives, which would burn it off. Using it the way Mr. Assad’s forces have — essentially dropping it in concentrated form in a barrel — can lead to far more casualties.

“The most dangerous prospect was that someone would use chlorine in the way that the Syrian regime has done and disperse it in a whole community,” he said. “It is a dangerous element, and you cannot remove it from any environment in the Middle East,” given its importance in water purification.

As a result, chemical weapons treaties do not bar its possession. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which went into force in 1997 and which Syria joined, under pressure, in 2013, does bar deliberately using it as a poison gas.

Nations have been finding loopholes in such international agreements — or ignoring them entirely — since the first failed efforts to bar such weaponry more than a century ago. Mr. Assad has clearly calculated that turning a widely available chemical into a weapon to clear out neighborhoods and create terror is a potent option.

“For me, the big story is chlorine; it’s not sarin,” Mr. Knights said. “The regime has been good at using a chemical weapon that has enormous availability and is produced in completely legal, dual-use facilities and vital to the running of any country.”

“Intent is the problem when you’ve got a regime that loves using this stuff,” he added. “You either have to deter the regime from using it by imposing significant costs, or you have to get rid of the regime. But there is no way you can get rid of the capability.”

No international investigative body has yet determined what chemicals were used in the attack last Saturday in Douma, near Damascus. The American intelligence assessments suggest that while chlorine was the primary chemical, “some additional information points to the regime also using” sarin, which is more dangerous and harder to handle.

Videos taken in the aftermath of the attack show large yellow canisters that experts have said appear to be chlorine tanks, of the kind often used for civilian purposes.

Some videos show one canister that appears to have either broken through a wall or flown through a hole in it and landed on a bed without exploding.

Another video shows a similar canister that appears to have knocked a hole in the concrete roof of an apartment building.

Syrian activists who visited the site, as well as a report by Bellingcat, a group that conducts investigations with open-source data, said that the canister had fallen on the roof of a building where dozens of people had been sheltering on the lower floors.

The available evidence suggests that whatever substance was in the canister was released after it landed and wafted down the stairs, killing those on the floors below.

Subsequent videos show dozens of men, women and children lying lifeless on the ground with foam coming from their mouths and nostrils and what appear to be burned corneas. Both symptoms can be caused by chlorine.

In a series of tweets after studying the attack, Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, said that the canister appeared to have been dropped toward no specific target, and had just happened to land on a densely packed building.

Had the canister fallen elsewhere, Mr. Higgins wrote, “we’d see a fraction of deaths, and you probably wouldn’t have even heard about it happening.”

“It was really just thanks to the catastrophic success of the chlorine attack that anyone even cared, not anything that Assad could have planned for,” Mr. Higgins wrote.State securities regulators say that the legislation would gut their powers, even though relatively few executives were held to account following the financial crisis.

“This bill would be terrible for investors all across America,” Eric Schneiderman, the attorney general of New York, said in an interview. “For every Fortune 500 C.E.O. who walks away with a bruised ego, there are dozens and dozens of lower-level scam artists who we put out of business through the state securities laws.”

Joseph P. Borg, the longtime director of the Alabama Securities Commission, said, “Any way you look at it, this bill is going to put investors at not only a disadvantage, but deep in harm’s way.”

“If I can’t prosecute, then what’s the deterrent?” added Mr. Borg, who is also the head of the National American Securities Administrators Association. “If I can’t bring civil action, then what’s the deterrent? None.”

Critics of the bill also said it represented the kind of rollback of states’ rights for which Republicans once criticized Democrats. President Trump is already challenging the states on sanctuary cities and California’s power to set its own car regulations.

The securities bill was introduced by Representative Tom MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican and a former A.I.G. executive who once worked for Mr. Greenberg. C.V. Starr, Mr. Greenberg’s current company, has backed Mr. MacArthur’s campaign. A spokesman for the congressman said he was unavailable to comment.

Blair Holmes, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Chamber, said the organization was reviewing the legislation. “This issue has always been important to many members,” she said.

If it goes through, the bill’s text says it would “provide for exclusive federal jurisdiction over civil securities fraud actions.” It also says that “differing state regulatory requirements” create “inefficiencies, raises costs” and harms markets “without providing material investor protection benefits.”

Mr. Greenberg and his staff said the legislation would only affect civil enforcement related to stocks, bonds and other securities listed on national exchanges. State regulators disagree, saying it would also hamper their criminal jurisdiction related to such securities.

The bill language says that state officials can proceed with criminal enforcement provided they “comply in all respects with the legal requirements for securities fraud under federal law.” State regulators fear that such language is specifically intended to curtail their ability to bring criminal cases.

One feature of the Martin Act is that it does not require the state to prove that someone actually intended to defraud people, a lower bar than what is required at the federal level.

“It’s outrageous,” Mr. Greenberg said of the intent issue. Asked if legislation broadly targeting all states was an appropriate remedy, he replied: “So is it better to have a law that violates every principle? Is that better? You can be tried for something without having to prove intent? Are we a third world country?”

The case against him centered around two sets of transactions. One of them inflated A.I.G.’s reserves at a time when analysts were criticizing the company for its flagging reserves. In a second series of deals, the insurer invested in an offshore entity in a way that allowed it to mask losses from one of its divisions.

After Mr. Greenberg’s ouster, A.I.G. restated its earnings by more than $3 billion. In 2006, the company reached a $1.64 billion settlement with federal, state and insurance regulators related to business practices stretching back two decades.

Mr. Greenberg has disputed much about the case.

“Eliot Spitzer decided he wanted to take me down,” he said. “He was successful. Destroyed a company that had a $180 billion market cap. Now it’s what? A fraction of that. There’s been seven C.E.O.s since I left the company. Destroyed a great asset.”

But in a statement he made as part of his 2017 settlement, he said he “initiated, participated in and approved” the transactions that “inaccurately portrayed the accounting, and thus the financial condition and performance for A.I.G.’s loss reserves and underwriting income.”

A.I.G. also faced a reckoning and near failure in the financial crisis.

“The notion that we would weaken one of the few statutes that was used effectively to confront structural failures on Wall Street defies logic, at a moment so soon after the economic cataclysm of 2008,” Mr. Spitzer said in an interview.

Mr. Greenberg said he decided to settle last year because “there’s a limit to how much any individual can endure fighting” the state. He added: “There was no acknowledgment of any wrongdoing, No. 1. And that’s important.”

Mr. Schneiderman, the attorney general who settled the case, said Mr. Greenberg’s case was “very straightforward,” noting that A.I.G. had restated the transactions on its books.

Regarding the legislation, he added, “I don’t know anyone who is saying we should have less regulation of securities fraud.”Photo

WASHINGTON — Barbara Bush, the wife and mother of presidents who has long been among the most popular members of her famous family, has decided to stop seeking medical treatment to prolong her life as she faces a variety of ailments, people close to the family said on Sunday.

Mrs. Bush, who is 92 and frail, has been in and out of the hospital but has now forsworn further interventions and “will instead focus on comfort care,” according to a statement issued by her husband’s office in Houston.

“It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face of her failing health, worrying not for herself — thanks to her abiding faith — but for others,” the statement said. “She is surrounded by a family she adores, and appreciates the many kind messages and especially the prayers she is receiving.”Photo

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to impose new sanctions against Russia on Monday to punish it for enabling the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war, the latest in a series of actions by both sides underscoring the deterioration in relations between Moscow and the West.

The sanctions, coming shortly after American-led airstrikes against facilities linked to Syria’s chemical weapons, are meant to signal that the United States holds responsible not just the Damascus government of President Bashar al-Assad but also his patrons in Russia and Iran. President Trump has vowed that Syria’s allies will pay a “big price” for permitting his use of poison gas.

The sanctions were announced on Sunday by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and the administration’s leading public voice excoriating Russia in recent days. “They will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use,” she said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message and our hope is that they listen to it.”

Mr. Trump has tried through most of his presidency to forge a friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and avoid criticizing him personally even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigated whether his campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, Mr. Trump’s administration has taken increasing action against Russia, and the president singled out Mr. Putin over Syria’s use of chemical weapons on Twitter and again in a televised speech on Friday night.

New sanctions on Monday would be the third round enacted by the Trump administration against Russia in the past four weeks. Last month the administration targeted Russian companies and individuals for intervening in the 2016 election and mounting cyberattacks against Western facilities. It followed that this month with penalties against Mr. Putin’s inner circle, singling out some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials.

The administration also expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain.Photo

When President Trump fired James B. Comey as the director of the F.B.I. last May, that did not mean the end of Mr. Comey’s time in the public eye — far from it. His memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” is about to be released and Mr. Comey is featured in a wide-ranging interview with ABC News that is set to air on Sunday at 10 p.m. Eastern.

For days, Mr. Trump has waged a ferocious counterattack against Mr. Comey, who portrays the president in his book as an unethical and dishonest leader. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump unleashed a barrage of Twitter posts, calling Mr. Comey a liar and denying he had asked him for loyalty.

Mr. Trump suggested Mr. Comey should be jailed, accusing him of leaking classified information and lying to Congress. He referred to the Clinton email investigation, saying Mr. Comey “was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job.” He also called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” again, and said he had thrown the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, “under the bus.”

Here is an overview of The New York Times’s coverage of Mr. Comey, who earned a reputation for being fastidiously nonpartisan yet has found himself, repeatedly, at the center of some of Washington’s fiercest political storms.

A letter to Congress, weeks before the election

Mr. Comey made a fateful decision in October 2016, when he was the F.B.I. director. In a letter that was immediately made public (you can read it here), he told Congress the agency was reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.

It was not standard protocol for the F.B.I. to make these kinds of announcements publicly. But Mr. Comey determined that this time was different, in part because he believed that failing to disclose the investigation could tarnish both the F.B.I. and the presidential election.

Here is a deep dive into the back story of that decision, which may have contributed to Mr. Trump’s upset victory.The interview with Mr. Comey and the weekslong media blitz he plans for his book amount to a remarkable public assault on a sitting president by someone who served at the highest levels of power in the government.

Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server has long been the subject of controversy and that meeting with Mr. Clinton cast a shadow over the federal investigation.Just like that, she had stumbled into a growing industry that makes money by coaxing women into having surgery — sometimes unnecessarily — so that they are more lucrative plaintiffs in lawsuits against medical device manufacturers.

Lawyers building such cases sometimes turn to marketing firms to drum up clients. The marketers turn to finance companies to provide high-interest loans to the clients that have to be repaid only if the clients receive money from the case. Those loans are then used to pay for surgery performed by doctors who are often lined up by the marketers.

Interviews with dozens of women, lawyers, finance executives and marketers, as well as a review of court records and confidential documents, indicate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women have been sucked into this assembly-line-like system. It is fueled by banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, which provide financial backing.

The profits are immense. So are the costs to women. Some suffer physical problems from the surgery. Others say they have become depressed or unable to work. Still others have to get mesh reinserted.

Ms. Plummer’s brush with the industry left her wearing diapers.

Faulty Products

The industry of providing financing to law firms involved in litigation is not new. In recent years, it has expanded into a diverse array of businesses. A spate of companies, such as a Brooklyn outfit named Law Cash, have popped up to provide upfront cash to plaintiffs hoping for big legal settlements.

The litigation surrounding mesh implants is a lucrative niche. These so-called mass tort cases, some of which began six years ago when problems with the implants started to arise, encompass claims brought by tens of thousands of women who say they were harmed by the same products.

Millions of women worldwide received mesh implants. They are used to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman’s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall.

But many women complained that the implants caused problems such as bleeding and discomfort during sex.

Litigation against the implants’ manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, proliferated. There are more than 100,000 plaintiffs in federal court alone. Many more are involved in litigation at the state level or outside the United States.

Representatives of Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson said they stood by the quality of their products. The mesh manufacturers have set aside more than $3 billion to cover potential mesh-related settlements.

Not all plaintiffs are equal. Some law firms — which are paid a percentage of any settlements — realized that women with the implants still in their bodies tended to receive smaller settlements than those who had them taken out.

“Defendants have offered next to nothing to settle cases involving mesh products that have not been removed,” Ms. Plummer’s lawyers at McSweeney Langevin, a small Minneapolis personal injury firm, wrote in a letter advising her to get the implant taken out.

Rhett McSweeney, a co-founder of the law firm, said in a statement that the firm never forced clients to undergo unnecessary surgery and “never directed a client to a particular doctor.”

Plaintiffs’ firms turned to marketers to recruit clients. Women with mesh implants said they soon started receiving torrents of unsolicited phone calls, some originating overseas. The women said they didn’t know how these marketers had found them and seemed to know their medical histories.

“I think my privacy was breached,” said Jennifer Godsoe, 66, who lives in Cumberland, Me. “The more I think about it, the more upset I get.”

Some women had vague memories of answering an online ad about mesh problems. The only thing linking some other women was that they previously had the same doctors, court records show.

Women who took the marketing bait were connected to doctors willing to perform the mesh-removal surgery — although that process remains murky. One critical player was Surgical Assistance, a Florida company led by Wesley Blake Barber, which acted as a middleman between the women, doctors and funding companies. Mr. Barber’s lawyer declined to comment.

In a deposition last summer, Mr. Barber outlined how the company had lined up doctors in Florida and Georgia to perform the surgery. In one online ad, an actor in a white lab coat assures women suffering from their mesh implants that relief is near. By calling a toll-free number, the women will be set up with a “network of qualified surgeons” who remove the mesh without requiring upfront payments.

Women who opted for surgery were flown to Florida and Georgia, put up in motels and sent to walk-in clinics, court filings show. The women generally didn’t meet the doctors who would be operating on them until shortly before the procedure. Before going under the knife, few women got a second opinion.

Dan Christensen, a lawyer who ran MedStar Funding, which financed mesh removal surgery, said in an interview that it was “ludicrous” to argue that women had undergone unnecessary surgery.

“You have to have a doctor willing to put his license on the line,” he said. “Why jeopardize your license?”

$14,000 a Day

The work was lucrative. Doctors stood to make $14,000 a day.

Doctors sometimes churned through four or five removals in a day. Each procedure typically cost about $21,000, according to lawsuits brought by women against the mesh manufacturers. Of that, doctors pocketed roughly $3,500 per surgery; most of the rest went to the medical centers where the surgery took place.

Law Cash offered Danette Charnetzky, a hospice worker in Waynesburg, Ohio, financing for a removal surgery in December 2014. Ms. Charnetzky, another McSweeney client, agreed to pay the money back, at a double-digit interest rate, if the litigation was successful. Within a week, she and her husband were on a plane to a surgical center in a Florida strip mall. The process was a terrifying blur.

“I wish I could have changed my mind, but we were already there,” said Ms. Charnetzky, 49, who hasn’t received any money from the pending litigation against the mesh manufacturer. “I just prayed for the best.”

She got the worst — or something close to it. Ms. Charnetzky said she had needed two more procedures to repair scar tissue left by the Florida surgery.

Rhonda Espeland, 63, who was living in Arizona, also had a bad experience. Since her mesh implant was removed in January 2015, she has developed incontinence. “I may need another surgery,” she said.

The bladder problems have left Ms. Espeland unable to work, and she hasn’t received any money from litigation against her mesh manufacturer. Boxes of diapers are regularly delivered to her door.

The doctor who performed her surgery — and similar procedures on hundreds of others — was Earle M. Pescatore. In March 2014, around the time that he started doing lots of procedures, Mr. Pescatore and his wife filed for bankruptcy, citing liabilities of $1.5 million, including $38,000 they owed to the Internal Revenue Service, according to court filings. Dr. Pescatore said in a deposition that he had little memory of women he operated on.

“Any treatment that Dr. Pescatore provided would have been medically necessary,” his lawyer, Mark DiCowden, said.

While studies have shown that up to 15 percent of women with mesh implants will encounter problems, removing the mesh is not always recommended. Taking it out is more complicated than inserting it because the mesh is made of fiber that is designed to bond with tissue.

Many of the women who got the surgery had limited or no health insurance. They rarely discussed the surgery with their primary care physicians before arriving at the clinics. Some said they had felt rushed into getting surgery.

Dr. Victor Nitti, a surgeon specializing in complex pelvic issues at NYU Langone Health in New York, said serious mesh problems should be addressed with surgery. But, he said, “scaring a patient who has limited to no symptoms into removal is just dangerous and irresponsible.”

Dr. Nitti said he had grown concerned about such scare tactics after some patients told him that they had been contacted by marketers.

Funding Machine

A handful of specialized finance firms funded the surgery that Ms. Plummer, Ms. Espeland and other women got. Court filings show that the two main players are Law Cash and Banyan Finance of Boca Raton, Fla., and that the firms charge double-digit interest rates.

Ross Elgart, Banyan’s chief executive, did not respond to requests for comment.

Lew Fidler, Law Cash’s general counsel, said financing surgical procedures such as Ms. Plummer’s is a small portion of the company’s business. He said the firm, which typically provides cash advances to help plaintiffs pay for everyday expenses, ensures that each surgery is necessary.

“I feel for anyone who didn’t get the outcome they were looking for, but we are not doctors,” Mr. Fidler said. “We don’t substitute our judgment for a licensed physician.”

Law Cash, like other firms, is paid back for a surgical advance only if the person gets a settlement. The firms contend that high interest rates cover the risk that some borrowers will never collect settlements. Some women, however, said the high interest rates had never fully been explained to them.

As a result of those steep interest rates, plaintiffs who do collect settlements see much of the money go to the financing firms. Another large slice goes to their lawyers.

Medical funding for personal injury litigants was a topic of discussion Friday in Las Vegas at the mass tort industry’s big annual conference, titled “Mass Torts Made Perfect.” Law firms are eyeing mesh used to treat hernias as the next gold mine.

The industry has grown thanks in part to a gusher of money from mainstream financial institutions. Law Cash gets funding from DZ Bank, Germany’s second-largest bank, and Melody Capital Partners, a hedge fund with $1.8 billion in assets.

McSweeney Langevin, which has represented more than 1,000 women in mesh litigation, got backing from EJF Capital, a Virginia hedge fund with $10 billion in assets, according to corporate records.

Many of McSweeney’s clients initially were signed up by a now-defunct law and marketing firm, Alpha Law. The Washington firm had signed up 14,000 women for the mesh litigation. Its unusual role in the litigation was the subject of a series of Reuters articles.

The industry tries to keep the network of marketers and financiers out of sight — and some participants have refused to answer questions in depositions, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

“People are claiming the Fifth and so on and so forth,” said Magistrate Judge Cheryl Eifert in West Virginia, who is hearing one of the mesh cases in federal court. “They don’t have to talk about necessarily how much money they make, per se, but if someone would just give them an idea of how the arrangement works. But nobody’s willing to do that.”

Mr. Barber of Surgical Assistance, for example, asserted the privilege nearly two dozen times in a deposition.

Swollen Like Balloons

Jerri Plummer never figured out whom Yolanda worked for. But in December 2014, Dr. Whitney Shoemaker performed the implant-removal surgery. Until the day of the operation, Ms. Plummer had never spoken to Dr. Shoemaker. Her lawyer declined to comment.

Hours after Ms. Plummer went under the scalpel, she said, she was hustled back to a Hampton Inn just off the freeway, with a catheter sticking out of her side. The next day, a nurse arrived at the motel, removed the catheter and put her in a taxi to the airport.

Soon after she arrived home in Arkansas, she said, complications developed. Her legs swelled like balloons. Her stomach seized up. Ms. Plummer went to her original doctor for help, she said. He informed her that the damage was irreversible. Worse, she said in court records, he told her that there had been no need for the removal surgery.

Before the surgery, Ms. Plummer loved to take walks with her two pit bulls and to eat with her husband at Red Lobster. Now chronic incontinence forces her to wear diapers all day and has left her too worried about wetting herself to venture outside.

With the help of a local lawyer, James R. Baxter, she is suing Law Cash; Dr. Shoemaker; Mr. Barber and his firm, Surgical Assistance; and lawyers at the McSweeney firm.

Mr. McSweeney declined to comment on the lawsuit. His firm is trying to get Ms. Plummer’s lawsuit moved from federal court into private arbitration, where there is no judge or jury. In his statement, he said the firm “had no role” connecting clients with surgical funders like Law Cash or Banyan Finance.

The law firm now has clients sign a waiver that advises them that cash advances to pay for surgery “are terrible loans with extremely high interest rates.”

Ms. Plummer said she had never received such a warning. She feels that she was victimized twice — first by the mesh manufacturer and then by her lawyers and doctor. “I was taken advantage of through this whole process,” she said.A public university president in Oregon gives new meaning to the idea of a pensioner.

Joseph Robertson, an eye surgeon who retired as head of the Oregon Health & Science University last fall, receives the state’s largest government pension.

It is $76,111.

Per month.

That is considerably more than the average Oregon family earns in a year.

Oregon — like many other states and cities, including New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut — is caught in a fiscal squeeze of its own making. Its economy is growing, but the cost of its state-run pension system is growing faster. More government workers are retiring, including more than 2,000, like Dr. Robertson, who get pensions exceeding $100,000 a year.

The state is not the most profligate pension payer in America, but its spiraling costs are notable in part because Oregon enjoys a reputation for fiscal discipline. Its experience shows how faulty financial decisions by states can eventually swamp local communities.

Oregon’s costs are inflated by the way in which it calculates pension benefits for public employees. Some of the pensions include income that employees earned on the side. Other retirees benefit from long-ago stock market rallies that inflated the current value of their payouts.

For example, the pension for Mike Bellotti, the University of Oregon’s head football coach from 1995 to 2008, includes not just his salary but also money from licensing deals and endorsements that the Ducks’ athletic program generated. Mr. Bellotti’s pension is more than $46,000 a month.Few analysts, and certainly few Israelis, have suggested that Hamas may actually be rethinking its strategy merely because it has joined what are meant to be nonviolent mass protests and has name-checked the heroes of peaceful civil disobedience.

“It’s quite understandable that when those that proscribe Hamas as a terror organization see Haniya surrounded by icons of peace, it does little to dispel memories of very violent and bloody attacks, including by suicide bombs,” said Beverley Milton-Edwards, an expert on political Islam at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar who was a co-author of a history of Hamas.

But if Mr. Haniya’s unexpected nod to nonviolence struck some as contradictory and self-serving — as evidence of, one might say, a degree of chutzpah — his organization’s embrace of the Gaza protests had a clear logic that can be understood in much simpler terms.

Terms like “no-brainer.”

Its experiment with popular resistance may or may not be wholehearted, but it is indisputably pragmatic.

A month or two ago, Hamas was cornered. Isolated regionally, rived by internal disputes, it had been unable to ameliorate a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and was increasingly humiliated by the failure of reconciliation talks with Ramallah.

“They had to make too many concessions in the hope of getting a little bit in exchange, and they wound up getting nothing whatsoever,” said Azzam Tamimi, an analyst for a London-based Arabic television channel with close ties to top Hamas leadership.

After a decade running Gaza, and hemmed in by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, Hamas was growing deeply unpopular.

“Though most Gazans would blame Israel fundamentally, and Egypt indirectly, a lot of Palestinians would just do away with all of Hamas to have a better life,” said Tareq Baconi, author of “Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance,” to be published next month by Stanford University Press.

The group was in such dire straits that analysts and Israeli security officials warned it might provoke a new war out of sheer desperation to shake things up.

Yet, even the prospect of war seemed unavailing. Neither Hamas nor Gaza’s two million residents, still recovering from the past two conflicts, in 2012 and 2014, had any appetite for another round of violence.

“They’re absolutely exhausted,” Mr. Baconi said.

To its rockets Israel had responded with the Iron Dome antimissile system. To its tunnels Israel was answering with a $2 billion reinforced-concrete wall buried deep underground. And on Sunday, Israel said it had uncovered and destroyed the longest operational tunnel yet from Gaza.

It was no surprise, then, that after a grass-roots idea for a peaceful, long-lasting protest along the Gaza fence started gaining widespread support, Hamas brought a halt to what had been a fairly steady tempo of rocket launches into Israel and threw its considerable organizational might behind the demonstrations.

By embracing the protests, Hamas cannily aligned itself with a popular movement that became even more popular as it took shape — and that generated an outpouring of international support when Israel responded with gunfire, killing dozens of Palestinians, almost all of them unarmed.

Instantly, the woebegone Palestinian cause and the crisis in Gaza were back in the news, and even the demand for a right of return to Israeli land — one that many supporters of a two-state solution seemed ready to throw overboard — was being taken seriously, cheering Palestinians in refugee camps and the diaspora.

The time was ripe for a popular movement in Gaza, where younger Palestinians, like those on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, have grown disillusioned with the moribund Oslo peace process for self-governance, Mr. Baconi said. Many want to turn the national movement into a campaign for civil rights, rather than simply for statehood.

“Hamas is just jumping on the bandwagon and recognizing the effectiveness of popular resistance at this moment,” he said.

In fact, though it is better known for armed struggle, Hamas has acknowledged the utility of popular resistance since it arose out of the First Intifada in 1987. And last year, it took another subtle step in that direction, adopting a new policy that acknowledged growing support for popular resistance.

Yet, not all Gazans see Hamas’s involvement in the new protests as laudable. Some accused the group of cynically hijacking the demonstrations to serve its own purposes, while still also using young men as cannon fodder.

“It’s beautiful that we find Hamas adopting this nonviolent struggle,” Mohammad Al Taluli, a 26-year-old activist due in court this week on criminal charges for criticizing Hamas online, said sarcastically. “One week before the peaceful protest there was a military maneuver for the Qassam brigades. Do they think they fool us?”

“The gun is no longer a choice,” Mr. Al Taluli added. “It’s a burden on anybody who carries it.”

Yohanan Tzoreff, a former adviser for Arab affairs in Israel’s civil administration in Gaza, viewed the protests through the lens of Hamas’s long-running political rivalry with Fatah, in which Hamas hopes eventually to seize control of the Palestine Liberation Organization, over which Mr. Abbas now maintains a tight grip.

“Which is the way that the people will adopt?” Mr. Tzoreff said. “The way of Ramallah, which means negotiations, negotiations, negotiations, and our entire fight will be at the international level; or the way in Gaza: popular resistance, with a lot of readiness to sacrifice?”

For the moment, the two groups are enjoying an uneasy public truce, with Mr. Abbas expressing solidarity with the Gaza protests.

“Fatah publicly support the protests, but behind closed doors, they criticize them as nothing more than a Hamas stunt,” Ms. Milton-Edwards said.

For Hamas, the fate of its new embrace of popular protest depends on the ability of its leaders, and the Gaza marchers, to walk a fine line along the fence with Israel.

Too much in the way of stone- or firebomb-throwing could spark another heavy-handed Israeli response — and the kind of Palestinian blood bath that could compel Hamas to answer back with rockets.

“The more Israel uses disproportionate force, the harder it is for Hamas to continue holding back from retaliating,” Mr. Baconi said. “At some point, Hamas will start to lose legitimacy if it doesn’t.”Other western European countries have had trouble squarely facing such history; many Belgians were unaware of the atrocities in Congo under Belgian rule until the past generation. But Denmark, with less of a colonial record to confront than some countries, has had more trouble confronting it, according to Mr. Palsson.

“Somehow it annoys them more than others knowing about this background,” he said.

Hans Jonathan was born in 1784 in St. Croix, then a Danish possession and now part of the United States Virgin Islands. His mother was a black house slave owned by the Schimmelmanns, a Danish-German family, and his father was a white man.

When he was about 7, the Schimmelmanns took him to Copenhagen. In 1801, he volunteered to fight with the Danish navy, and emerged unharmed from a fierce battle with British ships.

“It was crazy warfare,” said Mr. Palsson, whose biography of Hans Jonathan was published in Icelandic in 2014, and in English in 2016. “The ship was bombarded heavily.”

Hans Jonathan earned the support of his superior officers, who spoke on his behalf to the royal household. Denmark’s crown prince and de facto ruler, the future King Frederik VI, wrote in a letter that Hans Jonathan “is considered free and enjoys rights.”

The French revolution had unleashed new ideas about equality and liberty. Like several other colonial powers, Denmark still allowed slavery in the Caribbean, but abolition movements at home were gaining ground, and the status of slaves brought to Europe from the colonies was murky.

Henrietta Schimmelmann tried to reclaim Hans Jonathan and take him back to St. Croix, and he went to court to assert his freedom, in a case that was famous in its time. But he could not produce the letter from Prince Frederik, for reasons unknown, and in 1802, the court dismissed his claim and ordered him to return to the Schimmelmanns, who wanted to sell him in St. Croix.

Instead, he fled, sailed to Iceland, settled in the small village of Djupivogur, married a local woman, had children, and lived as a free man until his death in 1827.

Though he was largely forgotten in Denmark, in Iceland he became a well-known figure in local folklore, said Kari Stefansson, head of the company deCode Genetics, whose father grew up in Djupivogur.

“People think it’s a beautiful story,” he said. “It shows that racism isn’t innate. It’s a learned behavior.”

DeCode published a study this year that takes advantage of Iceland’s highly homogeneous gene pool, its remarkably thorough genealogical records, and Hans Jonathan’s unique place in the country’s history.

Researchers identified some 780 living descendants of Hans Jonathan, took DNA samples from 182 of them, and isolated snippets that were characteristically African, and could only have come from him. They said they were able to reconstruct 38 percent of his mother’s genome, and trace it to parts of West Africa.

“It is certainly of interest how bits and pieces of an African genome are found in genomes of current Icelanders,” Mr. Stefansson said.

Some Icelanders knew of Hans Jonathan already, but many of his descendants, who are spread among several countries, lived most of their lives unaware that they had an ancestor who was a black slave.

Among them was Kirsten Pflomm, a communications manager from Connecticut, who did an online search of her own name 15 years ago, and found herself and entire family listed on a website written in Icelandic. She contacted the site’s administrator and learned the dramatic story of her five-times-great-grandfather.

”I clearly look very white,” she said. ”So I can’t claim to ever have experienced anything” resembling racism.

Ms. Pflomm is not seeking an official apology for Hans Jonathan’s time in shackles, or hoping to achieve greater Danish awareness of slavery and colonization. “That’s a bigger conversation that doesn’t include me,” she said.

But she petitioned Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, asking him to award Hans Jonathan his freedom. In a letter back to her, the prime minister wrote last month that her ancestor was a “beacon of liberty,” but that he “cannot reverse time or the verdict of the past, no matter how incomprehensible it may seem.”

But Astrid Nonbo Andersen, an expert on colonial history at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said that Danish views may have begun to change last year, during the centennial of the sale of the Denmark’s Caribbean islands to the United States.

“There was an explosion of events like never before,” she said. “But if it was just a news interest or something lasting remains to be seen.”

The wealth of the colonial era is visible in the elegant Rococo and Baroque mansions of Copenhagen. The first tribute to the people who suffered to create that wealth appeared on April 2, when a statue was unveiled of a black woman who led a 19th-century rebellion against Danish rule on St. Croix.

The statue, 23 feet tall, may be hard to ignore.

“It’s really big and right on the waterfront,” Ms. Andersen said. “Tourists will begin to ask, and tour guides will have to add a new chapter to their guiding.”Five months later, the Indonesian government has yet to implement the Constitutional Court ruling, although officials say they are working on it.

In a country where religion plays a large part in public life, followers of traditional beliefs, known generally as aliran kepercayaan, hope the ruling will finally end decades of unofficial discrimination that makes it difficult for them to get permits to open gathering places, obtain marriage licenses and get access to public services like health care and education. It also complicates efforts by those believers to get military, police or civil service jobs, or even burial plots in cemeteries.

There are hundreds of different forms of aliran kepercayaan spread across the vast Indonesian archipelago. In Java, the most populous island, it is often a mix of animist, Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic beliefs.

Forms of kepercayaan can include certain periodic religious observances, such as communal meals or acts that could be compared to Muslim men praying together on Fridays or Sunday Christian services. These may include ritual offerings to appease spirits, even though the practitioners could also be registered as Muslims, Catholics, Buddhists or one of the other recognized religions.

It is estimated that at least 20 million of Indonesia’s 260 million people practice local traditional beliefs, but the numbers could be much higher, according to analysts, as some are also followers of Islam, Christianity and other major religions.

Religion is so omnipresent in Indonesia that citizens are required to declare on their national ID cards which of the six approved religions they adhere to, though in some regions they are allowed to leave that section blank. However, doing so can invite discrimination and bureaucratic hassles, so many traditional believers simply state on their ID cards the religion that is dominant in the area where they live. In Java, it is likely to be Muslim, but in parts of the islands of Sumatra or Sulawesi, it could be Catholic or Protestant, while on Bali it would be Hindu.

But such workarounds should be unnecessary, some legal experts say.

“The court decision underlines that freedom of belief is a constitutional right, not a right that is given by the government,” said Bivitri Susanti, head of the Jakarta chapter of the Indonesian Association of Constitutional Law Lecturers.

“Second, it states that the right to belief in aliran kepercayaan, or faiths other than the six government-recognized religions, is inherent with the rights to religion as stated in Article 29 of the Indonesian Constitution,” she added.

But clouding that point of view is the fact that about 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, giving Islamic religious leaders outsize political clout. The Indonesia Ulema Council, the country’s top body of clerics, has been adamant, for example, that traditional beliefs should not be seen as on par with Islam.

“The Constitutional Court ruling was not considered carefully and hurt the feelings of the faithful, especially Indonesian Muslims, because the ruling has placed aliran kepercayaan as equals,” said Zainut Tauhid Sa’adi, the council’s vice chairman.

“The decision has legal consequences and an impact on our society,” he said.

Some hard-line Islamic groups want to go even further and change the Constitution to make Islam the official state religion.

However, key leaders within Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, support the court ruling.

Religion has always been a hot-button issue in Indonesia, which despite its Muslim majority has small but influential Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. There have been hundreds of religiously motivated attacks on religious minorities in recent years, some resulting in death, as well as the forced closures of houses of worship and the passage of local bylaws viewed as discriminatory against religious minorities.

That tension has also reached the political realm: In May last year, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the Christian governor of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy against Islam in a highly controversial case that his supporters say was concocted by radical Islamic groups bent on destroying his career.

As such, Indonesia’s Ministry of Home Affairs appears to be erring on the side of caution with the Constitutional Court’s November ruling.

Arief M. Edie, a ministry spokesman, said that the government respects and is implementing the ruling — but only by redesigning the national ID to accommodate the aliran kepercayaan as a choice in the section on religious status. It will not be recognized as the state’s seventh official religion.

“It’s acknowledged only as a culture, not a religion,” Mr. Arief said.

That narrow interpretation is not going over well with aliran kepercayaan followers, who say that local governments in Indonesia’s far-flung regions will continue to discriminate in the delivery of public services.

“The problem with any controversial ruling or policy lies in implementation down to the lowest level of government,” said Johannes Nugroho, an Indonesian political analyst and writer.

Mr. Nugroho, a former follower of both Christianity and kejawen, a traditional belief system, said he tried in vain to have Christianity removed from the religion section on his national identity card, preferring to have it left blank or, in an attempt to make a statement, changed to Hindu.

He said a clerk at his local government office flatly refused, then slyly suggested that if Mr. Nugroho would recite an Islamic creed to convert to Islam, he would put down Muslim on his identity card. Today it still identifies him as a Christian.

Still, traditional belief organizations say they are emboldened by the Constitutional Court ruling and see an opening to push for official acceptance.

“We’ll keep fighting for equality; we have equality, legally speaking, but in reality we don’t,” said Endang Retno Lastani, an elder with one Java-based group, whose national identity card is blank in the religious affiliation section.

“Our belief is the unity of God and people, just like other religions,” he said. “So what’s wrong with that?”1. “A perfectly executed strike.” That’s what President Trump called the American-led attack to punish Syria for its suspected use of chemical weapons. (He added a familiar phrase: “Mission Accomplished!”)

Defense officials said the strikes — which were limited in scope and carried out with Britain and France — had taken out the “heart” of President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program.

But they admitted the government had most likely retained some ability to use chemical agents. Here are seven takeaways. Above, smoke rising from the Syrian Scientific Research Center near Damascus, one of three targets.

The attack risked drawing the U.S. more deeply into a conflict with Syria’s patrons, Russia and Iran. Our Moscow bureau chief reports that despite heated rhetoric, there was a sense of relief among Russian officials that it was “a one-time shot,” in the words of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council rejected a Russian resolution condemning the strikes.The effective tax rate — the average annual property tax, as a percentage of the average estimated market value of homes in each area — was about 1.2 percent, around the same as the year before, Attom Data reported. States with the highest effective property tax rates included New Jersey, Illinois, Vermont, Texas and New Hampshire, all of which were above 2 percent.

If you’ve received your formal tax bill, it may be too late to file an appeal — sometimes called an abatement request.

Typically, cities and towns first send out a notice of assessment, showing how your home is valued for tax purposes. Property owners then have a certain amount of time to challenge the assessment, though the period varies from state to state and even city to city. Some areas give a two-week window, while others may allow several months. Assessors are generally strict about filing dates, so if you file paperwork late, your appeal may not be heard.

“You really need to know those deadlines,” said Aaron Vansant, a partner with DonovanFingar, a Birmingham, Ala., law firm specializing in real estate matters.

Property tax experts suggest taking some basic steps to check the accuracy of your property’s valuation. If you added on to your house, your tax bill will probably be higher. But if the assessment shows that your home has four bathrooms, and you know it has two and a half, that’s an error that should be corrected. You may be able to have the mistake fixed with a simple phone call to the assessor’s office, depending on the department’s workload.

“It never hurts to pick up a phone and call,” said Risë E. Rosen, a property tax lawyer in Mineola, N.Y.

If you do file an appeal, you’ll need some data to back up your claim. That could be sales data for homes comparable to yours, provided by a real estate agent. Or, it could be a formal appraisal. The National Taxpayers Union offers tips on its website, including attending an appeals board hearing to get a feel for the process.

Mr. Vansant said he expected more homeowners to appeal property assessments next year because of recent changes in federal income tax law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law last year, capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, so more homeowners may push back on higher property tax bills, he said.

Here are some questions and answers about property taxes:

How is my home valued for property tax purposes?

Tax bills are based on the market value of your home, or a percentage of its full market value, multiplied by a local tax rate — often known as a millage rate. (One “mill” equals $1 per $1,000 of assessed value.) Often, assessor departments provide examples online, to show how your town’s bills are calculated.

Do I get a discount for property taxes that are paid on my main home?

Many areas allow for a “homestead” exemption, which provides a discount or credit on your tax bill if the property is your main home. If you don’t see the exemption noted on your tax bill, check with your assessor to make sure you are getting the credit to which you are entitled. Also, some areas may offer a discount if you pay your taxes early, Mr. Vansant said.

How much will I pay for a property appraisal?

Fees vary, but an appraisal for a real estate tax appeal will probably cost $300 to $500, said Jim Murrett, president of the Appraisal Institute, a professional association of real estate appraisers.“If we want change, it’s on us,” Ms. Nixon told the crowd after the party’s representatives endorsed her, with more than 90 percent of the vote. “We have to make it happen.”

The party’s decision came after a frantic set of developments on Friday. Two of Mr. Cuomo’s allies in the labor movement sought to stymie the Working Families Party by withdrawing from the organization, while the governor was said to have suggested withholding money from grass-roots community groups that have endorsed Ms. Nixon. Mr. Cuomo’s allies denied the governor had made this threat.

The public relations offensive continued on Saturday as several labor leaders and groups, including some who had been closely involved with the Working Families in the past, continued to criticize the party, in one case calling their leaders “lifestyle progressives” who had strayed from “their trade union roots.”

Speaking to the party faithful, the party’s state director, Bill Lipton, seemed to confirm that the loss of labor backing — including the departure on Friday of two powerful unions representing communication and building workers — had been traumatizing.

“This has been a rough week for the W.F.P.,” Mr. Lipton told the crowd on Saturday afternoon at the Albany Hilton.

Another leader, Karen Scharff, the party’s co-chairwoman, expressed “the greatest respect” for the two unions that had dropped out on Friday — Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and Communications Workers of America District 1.

“It saddens me to see them step away at this moment,” Ms. Scharff said, adding, “I’m confident that we will work together in the future.”

But it was also apparent that the tactics of Mr. Cuomo — who had a fraught relationship with the party, dating to his ultimately successful struggle in 2014 to get its nomination — and his allies had seemingly only hardened the consensus around Ms. Nixon.

“To endorse Cynthia Nixon is a very, very brave thing to do,” said Zephyr Teachout, who herself ran a spirited primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo in 2014, and is now working with Ms. Nixon’s campaign, adding that the governor’s actions to undermine the Working Families Party in recent days had been “horrifying.”

“Behind every bully,” she said, “there’s a coward.”

On Friday evening, after the union pullout, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign had said he would not seek the endorsement or the formal nomination of the Working Families Party, which will be finalized at its convention next month.

And after the party’s vote, Abbey Fashouer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, defended the governor’s record — citing an increase in the minimum wage, a paid family leave program and billions in funding for education.

“The schism between the progressive unions who founded the W.F.P. and some of its member organizations is unfortunate,” Ms. Fashouer said. “But in that divide the governor stands with the unions who have left the W.F.P.”

A small cadre of party members had argued that the party should wait until their convention next month to endorse Ms. Nixon, with some warning that a Nixon candidacy, and a general election ballot line, could siphon votes from Mr. Cuomo in November and help a Republican candidate.

“We are deeply, deeply concerned about creating a spoiling situation,” said Beverly Brakeman, an official with U.A.W. Region 9A, which represents autoworkers and others in New England and New York City.

But those sentiments were drowned out by pro-Nixon supporters like Andrew Falk, a state committee member from Putnam County. “When the W.F.P. is under attack, what do we do?” Mr. Falk said. “Stand up, fight back.”

In early polls, Ms. Nixon — who began her campaign in mid-March — trails Mr. Cuomo by hefty margins among Democratic voters. Still, on Saturday, surrounded by fans, she seemed confident that she could compete.

She thanked the party for having her back, and said, “and just know I’ve always got yours.” She added, “Let’s win this thing.”The Ulster case began when a 19-year-old woman said she was raped in June 2016 at a party at Mr. Jackson’s home. In a text to a friend a day after the house party, she appeared intimidated by the prospect of facing down the men she had accused: “I’m not going to the police. I’m not going up against Ulster Rugby. Yea, because that’ll work.”

Mr. Jackson and Mr. Olding were charged with rape and sexual assault. The trial centered on whether the woman had consented to the acts performed on her, and on the sometimes contradictory accounts of what had been done, and by whom, on a night fueled by alcohol.

Mr. Olding said he had had consensual oral sex with the woman, but both men denied having had vaginal sex with her. A taxi driver who took her home testified that she had been “sobbing throughout the journey” and that he saw blood on the back of her white jeans. A doctor told the court that he had observed a laceration in her bleeding vagina. But defense experts argued that this was not proof of rape or even that she had had sex.

The young woman spent eight days on the witness stand being questioned by each of the defendants’ lawyers. She sat in court while her underwear was passed around for the jury to examine. Defense lawyers cited testimony that said the young woman did not physically resist or scream for help from other women downstairs.

The criminal law in Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, is based on the principle that guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. And after a grueling trial, the two players — and two of their friends who had been charged with lesser offenses — were unanimously cleared by a jury of eight men and three women after less than four hours of deliberation.

On the steps of the courthouse, Mr. Jackson’s lawyer, Joe McVeigh, strongly criticized the complainant and the police for taking the case. Mr. Olding, speaking through his lawyer, maintained that everything had been consensual but said: “I am sorry for the hurt that was caused to the complainant.”

But anti-rape and women’s rights activists said that some of the evidence produced in court, particularly private WhatsApp messages sent among the young men and their friends, had raised disturbing questions about the attitude of some Irish men toward sex, consent and women in general.

Court records showed that after the party, Mr. Olding posted a message — “We are all top shaggers” — to a private WhatsApp group that included Mr. Jackson. The group exchanged boastful, abusive and misogynistic messages that appeared to refer to the young woman, including, “Mate no jokes she was in hysterics.” One member of the group concluded a graphic exchange with “Legends!! … Why are we all such legends?”

Defense lawyers argued that the comments were exaggerated boyish banter. But those remarks, and the vitriol unleashed by some of the men’s supporters against the woman, whose identity is protected in Northern Ireland’s legal system, were condemned.

After the verdict, some called for her to be named and said she should be punished for trying to ruin the lives of innocent young men.

Luke Rossiter, a semiprofessional player with Drogheda United soccer team in the Irish Republic, called on Twitter for her to be “locked up” and directed obscene abuse at women who had supported her. He later apologized for his “stupid and immature” comments and vowed to donate his wages for the rest of the season to a rape crisis center.

Willie John McBride, a celebrated former player for the Ireland rugby team, which represents both parts of the island, gave the players more measured support on a Dublin-based radio show this past week.

“The guys have come through a very traumatic couple of months where they’ve virtually been tried on television every day, walking in and out of the court,” he said, adding, “It is time they were back playing rugby again.”

The verdict failed to quell the rising anger of supporters of the young woman and survivors of sexual violence, who continued to rally under the hashtag #ibelieveher. (When Mr. Jackson’s lawyers threatened after the verdict to sue anyone who attacked his client or questioned the verdict on social media, a blizzard of defiant responses emerged under #suemepaddy.)

The following week, Mr. Jackson put out a more contrite statement: “I am ashamed that a young woman who was a visitor to my home left in a distressed state. This was never my intention, and I will always regret the events of that evening.”

Cara Cash-Marley, the chief executive of Nexus, a rape counseling service in Northern Ireland, said the trial had again exposed the onerous burden of proof placed on those who brought sexual assault complaints.

She said complainants should be allowed to record their evidence when it was fresh in their minds, rather than be expected to repeat it many times over — and finally to be aggressively cross-examined in court years later.

Cliona Saidlear, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, said the case may have spurred a new willingness to re-examine prevailing attitudes about sex and consent. “There is a macho culture in sport, and a hookup culture,” she said. “And we have to say, just because it is this way, does it have to be that way?”

The decision to sack the two players came amid commercial sponsors’ concerns that the men’s return would damage the image of a sport that has grown in popularity in recent years — not least among Irish women.

But a recent episode hinted at the hurdles still remaining. In Belfast this past week, the Malone rugby club said that it was investigating a photograph that had emerged of two players simulating sex acts with a trophy cup, the names of Mr. Jackson and Mr. Olding stuck to their torsos.The dispute has been festering for months. But the tension peaked when the pipeline’s owner, Kinder Morgan of Houston, said last weekend that it is suspending all nonessential spending on the program.

The company gave British Columbia until the end of May to end its attempts to delay or block the project. If not, the company said it would cancel its plan to add a second pipeline along aroute that opened in 1953.

To try to resolve the standoff, Mr. Trudeau has summoned Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, and John Horgan, her counterpart in British Columbia, to Ottawa for talks on Sunday.

Given the intransigence of both sides, even Mr. Trudeau’s top officials are downplaying the idea that the conversation will end the battle. But it may provide a glimpse of how Mr. Trudeau intends to grapple with an issue in which any resolution will inevitably alienate some voters, and on which there isn’t a clear national consensus.

“Canadians are quite divided,” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling firm based in Vancouver. “So much of this debate is rural versus urban Canada.”

Like the Keystone XL pipeline to the Gulf Coast of the United States, which was quashed by President Barack Obama and revived by Mr. Trump, the expansion of the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline is the latest attempt by the oil sands industry to push more of its product out to market. The pipelines have not expanded at the same rate as output from the oil sands, leaving many producers relying on expensive rail shipments to get their product to the United States, which currently buys almost all of Canada’s oil and gas exports.

Tankers filled by the current Kinder Morgan pipeline now sail to refineries on the West Coast of the United States. The extra capacity from an expansion could, in theory, allow oil sands companies to also begin shipping to Asian markets where demand for oil is growing, said Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist at the University of Alberta.

Ms. Notley, and her left-of-center New Democratic Party, surprised the Canadian political world in 2015 by bringing four and a half decades of Progressive Conservative rule to an end in Alberta. While she vowed in her campaign to take on the big oil interests in the province, politically she has no choice but to be a booster of the pipeline. Polls show that Albertans overwhelmingly want the expansion to go ahead.

To defend the expansion, the premier has shown a willingness to get tough with her provincial neighbor to the west. Earlier this year, Ms. Notley briefly banned imports of wine from British Columbia.

And unless the meeting Sunday changes her mind, Ms. Notley’s government is expected to introduce legislation next week that will give it the ability to restrict oil and gas shipments to British Columbia, and so driving up prices in the province.

“If the national interest is given over to the extremes on the left or the right, if the voices of the moderate majority of Canadians are forgotten, the reverberations of that will tear at the fabric of Confederation for many, many years to come,” Ms. Notley said on Monday, referring to the power-sharing system that Canada adopted in 1867.

This past week, Ms. Notley suggested that if Kinder Morgan decides not to go ahead with the expansion, the provincial government may buy and build the pipeline. Officials in Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet have suggested that the federal government might support such a plan.

For Mr. Horgan in British Columbia, the political calculus surrounding the pipeline expansion was more complex. The project is widely opposed in the areas around Vancouver and Victoria, the provincial capital, according to Ms. Kurl, the pollster. But support is strong for it elsewhere in the province, where resource industries are big employers.

Photo

Perhaps tipping the scale in his decision to try to block the project is that Mr. Horgan, also a member of the New Democratic Party, relies on the support of three Green Party members to pass legislation. That party, like many environmental groups, argues that Canada should not be building oil pipelines while it is attempting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

So Mr. Horgan plans to ask a court to determine if British Columbia can use local permits and provincial environmental laws to block the pipeline.

Mr. Trudeau’s government has cited several decisions, including some from the Supreme Court, that it contends give Ottawa complete authority over interprovincial pipelines. But it appears that the federal government can do nothing to stop Mr. Horgan from going to court. Any judicial review could at least delay the project.

The sparring between the two premiers may prove to be the least of Mr. Trudeau’s worries in the pipeline fight, as he tries to balance Canada’s economic dependence on the energy industry with his climate change commitments.

Environmental groups and some indigenous groups have vowed to stop the pipeline expansion through widespread civil disobedience. Those arrested already for breaking court orders to keep back from Kinder Morgan property include Elizabeth May, the leader of the federal Green Party.

Many environmental groups are using the pipeline expansion as a proxy in the fight against the oil sands, a source of fossil fuels that they condemn as excessively polluting.

“In an ideal world, we would like to see the federal government recognizing that it made an egregious mistake in approving this pipeline,” said Cam Fenton, a Canada strategy manager for 350.org, a nonprofit that opposes new fossil fuel projects. “At the end of the day polls change, science doesn’t. And it says we cannot deal with climate change and build pipelines.”Mr. Kim’s friendly welcome also contrasted with the reception that Mr. Song received the last time he visited North Korea, as a special envoy of Mr. Xi in November. At that time, Mr. Kim refused to meet him and launched an intercontinental ballistic missile several days later.

This time, Beijing sent Mr. Song and an art troupe to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, to attend an international art festival.

On Saturday, Mr. Kim “expressed satisfaction with improving ties between the two parties and nations,” the North Korean news agency said. “He voiced a need to elevate the traditional friendship to a new level of development meeting new demands of the times.”

Ties between China and North Korea had become strained in recent years, as Mr. Kim conducted a series of nuclear and missile tests and Beijing voted for increasingly harsh United Nations sanctions designed to squeeze the North to stop. The sanctions banned all major North Korean exports, such as coal, iron ore, textiles and seafood.

Those sanctions have hit the isolated North hard, as China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s external trade.

Until recently, Mr. Kim had refused to enter any talks on ending his nuclear weapons program. Instead, he accelerated his missile and nuclear tests after taking power in 2011, and declared in this year’s New Year’s Day speech that the North had achieved its goal of developing a nuclear deterrent.

Since then, he has suddenly shifted toward dialogue. He agreed to meet with President Moon on the inter-Korean border on April 27. President Trump has also accepted Mr. Kim’s invitation to a summit, agreeing to meet him in May or early June. Mr. Kim said he was willing to discuss denuclearizing if certain conditions, such as security guarantees for his regime, are met.On April 3, the board of WPP said it had appointed an independent counsel to investigate an allegation of what it called “personal misconduct” against Mr. Sorrell.

Richard Oldworth, a spokesman for WPP, said on Saturday that he could not comment beyond the company statement.

But in a separate statement to employees on Saturday, Mr. Sorrell made note of a “current disruption” that he argued “is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business.”

“That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside,” he said. “We have weathered difficult storms in the past. And our highly talented people have always won through, always.”

David Rigg, a spokesman for Mr. Sorrell, said on Saturday that he had “nothing further to add.”

Mr. Sorrell, a frenetic, loquacious man, looms as a giant of the advertising world. He is a fixture on the London and European social circuit among movers and shakers, hobnobbing as a regular at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and jetting to business events around the globe. Queen Elizabeth II knighted him in 2000 with a tap of her sword on his shoulders, the highest honor among a raft of awards he has received for his business acumen throughout the years.

A first-generation Jewish immigrant in Britain whose parents came from Kiev, Ukraine, Mr. Sorrell got his big break in advertising when he joined Saatchi & Saatchi in 1975. He quickly worked his way up and became so entwined with the agency’s founding siblings that he became known in the industry as “the third brother.”

In 1985, he struck out on his own with an improbable business gamble: He bought part of a British shopping basket manufacturer, Wire and Plastic Products, and proceeded to transform it into a global advertising behemoth, acquiring 18 advertising-related companies in just three years.

In 1989, he surprised the advertising world with a hostile $825 million takeover of Ogilvy & Mather, then one of the most influential ad agencies, and continued to snap up global competitors, including Young & Rubicam, a global marketing and communications company.

Mr. Sorrell shaped WPP with an iron grip, and fashioned it in his own image. (He is renowned for holding conversations while texting with clients and friends.) Today, WPP is a global advertising behemoth with 130,000 employees in 112 countries, and a market valuation of around 22 billion pounds, or about $31 billion.

Yet as he fashioned himself as a superstar executive, Mr. Sorrell also came under sharp scrutiny — especially for his increasingly lavish pay packages, which came to symbolize boardroom excess in Britain.

Since 2012, WPP has paid Mr. Sorrell £210 million, making him the highest paid chief executive of any company listed on the FTSE. Despite gains for WPP’s investors, a backlash emerged two years ago, when he pocketed a £70 million payout.

Since then, shareholders have balked at backing similarly large pay packages, and turned up criticism over WPP’s governance and the leader-centric corporate culture Mr. Sorrell appeared to have created.

His pay was capped at £19 million, and last year, he agreed to a £13 million limit on his annual salary starting in 2021.Photo

Steve Schirripa said that landing the role as Bobby Baccalieri on “The Sopranos” was like “hitting the lottery — twice.” Over the past few years, the actor, who was born in Brooklyn and grew up on welfare, has gone from wiseguy to good guy as a regular on the popular CBS series “Blue Bloods,” in which he plays an investigator for a district attorney. After graduating from Brooklyn College with a teaching degree, he moved to Las Vegas and worked several jobs in the service industry. He was a bouncer at Paul Anka’s disco, Jubilation (which later became the Shark Club), and a mâitre d’ at the Riviera hotel before becoming the entertainment director there in 1986. Later, he owned his own talent agency in Las Vegas. Mr. Schirripa, 60, now lives in Manhattan with his wife, Laura, 55. They have two daughters, Bria, 26, and Ciara, 22.

GOOD MORNING, PANDORA I get up late on Sundays, about 9:30 or 10 a.m., and the first thing I do is put on Pandora Radio and listen to some Van Morrison, and then I make some coffee. My wife is usually out running, and since my daughters are often gone — one has moved out, and the other is away at college — there’s usually no one home to bug me.

Photo

CEREAL READER After two cups of coffee, I get on my computer and start reading newspaper columns and going on TV news websites, and I wait for my wife to bring me home copies of The New York Times, The Daily News and The New York Post. It’s the only day of the week I read the papers in print, and I enjoy reading them while I’m eating cereal.

FRESH AIR OR COURTSIDE After a shower, I go out around noon and walk for an hour on the West Side Highway path near Battery Park City, along the water. It’s absolutely beautiful. I pass the World Trade Center, then continue to TriBeCa and sometimes Chelsea. I will only miss my Sunday walk if the Knicks are playing at Madison Square Garden. I love basketball. I played the game at Brooklyn College, and the Knicks were always my favorite team. I used to buy $6 tickets through our student union and sit in the nosebleed seats, dreaming about being one of those guys in the fancy suits sitting courtside, and then came “The Sopranos,” and now I’m a regular at courtside. It’s like living a dream.

THE STORIES OF THEIR LIVES After my walk, I go to Barnes & Noble on Warren Street to look for biographies. Right now I’m reading Nick Nolte’s, and I just finished Neil Simon’s. I’m fascinated by people’s life journeys, how they got from one place in life to another.

HONK IF YOU’RE A FAN Around 3 p.m., my wife and I usually go to Harry’s Italian Pizza Bar on Murray Street for lunch. We walk there — I don’t own a car in the city because I hate driving — and along the way, some people who recognize me will say hello, and people driving past will honk their horns. It’s a nice acknowledgment from fellow New Yorkers, most of whom are great and very respectful.

Photo

MEATY ERRANDS Late afternoon or early evening, we go home, and I’ll read the papers again and go over my lines from a script I’ve been given for “Blue Bloods” or some other project. Then my wife and I will go down to Faicco’s Pork Store on Bleecker Street and pick up stuff to make antipasto salad like provolone, mozzarella, soppressata and roasted peppers.

LOYALTY My favorite place for dinner is Il Cortile on Mulberry Street. During my first two years on “The Sopranos,” I lived right above the restaurant, and the people there were always great to me.“How’s that?” McKinnon asked.

“Because it will be me,” Bennett replied.

Soon after, Stiller walked on stage, introducing himself as Cohen, “attorney at law, and also sometimes not at law.” He went on to express disgust at having recently had his office and hotel raided by the F.B.I. in connection with multiple inquiries, including the Stormy Daniels affair, saying that the raids were “a complete violation of attorney-criminal privilege.”

Stiller acknowledged that the recent headlines had been problematic. (“I’m Donald Trump’s lawyer! I’ve got a whole hard drive that’s just labeled ‘Yikes!’”) But he remained loyal to the president, whom he called “the smartest, kindest, sexiest, least colluding man on this planet.”

Finally, Stiller was sent to an interrogation room to meet with De Niro, who immediately strapped him to a lie-detector machine. It took a couple of seconds for this part of the sketch to settle in with the audience. But eventually it hit: It was a recreation of a scene from the 2000 comedy “Meet the Parents,” in which Stiller and De Niro both starred, except that this time, De Niro was playing Mueller instead of an overprotective father.

The sketch even included lines lifted straight from the movie. There was Stiller saying, “You can milk anything with nipples.” And De Niro responding: “Really? I have nipples. Can you milk me, Mr. Cohen?”

The Return of John Mulaney

Mulaney made his highly anticipated hosting debut for “S.N.L.,” a show for which he was a writer for five seasons, creating among other things many “Weekend Update” sketches that have since become canon.

His opening monologue was a proper stand-up set that showcased his talent for dry, sardonic humor. He talked about aging: “I don’t like any new songs. Because every new song is about how tonight is the night.” He added: “I want to write songs for people in their 30s called ‘Tonight’s No Good. How About Wednesday?’”

On a related note, he expressed feeling left behind by modern technology. “The world is run by robots,” he said. “And sometimes they ask us if we’re a robot. Just because we’re trying to log on and look at our own stuff.”

He added: “You spend a lot of your day telling a robot you’re not a robot. Think about that for two minutes and tell me you don’t want to walk into the ocean.”

‘Weekend Update’ Jokes of the Week: Michael Cohen Edition

The hosts of “Weekend Update,” Michael Che and Colin Jost, went to town on Cohen’s headline-grabbing week. Here’s a sampling of the greatest hits:

“Authorities first became suspicious of Cohen when they found out he was the lawyer for Donald Trump.” — Michael Che “This does not look good for Trump. If being black has taught me anything, it’s that when the feds come kicking in your door, they’ve got something.” — M.C. “It’s amazing how we keep hearing ‘historic’ in reference to things that are happening during Trump’s administration, and none of them are positive. Historic has become a polite way of saying, ‘unbelievably terrible.’” — Colin Jost “These Trump stories are so random and insane, I feel like a contestant on ‘Chopped.’ ‘What the hell am I supposed to do with all these ingredients?’” — M.C. “President Trump responded to the claims in Comey’s memoir calling him a leaker and a liar, which coincidentally is also the name of the video the Russians have.” — C.J.

‘Weekend Update’ Deskside Bit of the Week

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Find a character McKinnon can’t play. This week, she portrayed the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has found herself in hot water recently after having taunted David Hogg, 17, one of the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

McKinnon revealed some of her new sponsors, which included Carl’s Sr. and Malaysian Airlines: “Caught in a scandal and need an escape? Malaysian Airlines.”

Over all, she was defiant: “I will continue to defend the First Amendment. That’s my right to bully people without being bullied in return.”

Sketch of the Week: A Song of Angry Crustaceans

Why would anyone ever order lobster at a New York City diner? Or any seafood, for that matter?

And with that one simple premise, the “S.N.L.” writers produced one of the best sketches of the season. A diner patron played by Pete Davidson really wanted some seafood after winning a lawsuit against Bumble, a dating app, for giving him zero matches.

After some initial pushback, the server relented, and out came a defiant Kenan Thompson, dressed as a 40-year-old lobster in a tank, singing a spirited parody of “One Day More,” a song from the Broadway musical “Les Misérables.” (“Who am I? And why am I condemned to boil alive? When all that I have done is live my life?”)

But Davidson was defiant. He wanted his lobster. It was on the menu, after all. This meant more “Les Misérables,” including a parody of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” by a group of revolutionaries at the barricades. (“When the churning in your bowels matches the burning of his shell, you’ll know why lobsters in a diner never sell!”)

A New Sound for Jack White

We’re filing Jack White’s performances this week squarely under “What Was That?”

And we like Jack White.

His first song was “Over and Over and Over,” from his new album “Boarding House Reach.” It was a bit strange and disjointed — but this is Jack White, after all. By the end, it was a runaway freight train.SYRIA-ISRAEL BORDER, Golan Heights — Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Syria is going to explode. I know, you have heard that one before, but this time I mean really explode. Because the U.S., British and French attack on Syria to punish its regime for its vile use of chemical weapons — and Russia’s vow to respond — is actually just the second-most dangerous confrontation unfolding in that country.

Even more dangerous is that Israel and Iran, at the exact same time, seem to be heading for a High Noon shootout in Syria over Iran’s attempts to turn Syria into a forward air base against Israel, something Israel is vowing to never let happen. This is not mere speculation. In the past few weeks — for the first time ever — Israel and Iran have begun quietly trading blows directly, not through proxies, in Syria.

And this quiet phase may be about to end.

Israel and Iran are now a hair-trigger away from going to the next level — and if that happens, the U.S. and Russia may find it difficult to stay out.

Let me try to explain what is unfolding from a lookout post on the Syrian-Israel border, where I stood a couple of days ago. To follow along at home, I highly recommend this website, which tracks the multiple interlocking Syrian conflicts in real time and is used by the U.N. observers here on the Golan Heights.SYRIA-ISRAEL BORDER, Golan Heights — Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Syria is going to explode. I know, you have heard that one before, but this time I mean really explode. Because the U.S., British and French attack on Syria to punish its regime for its vile use of chemical weapons — and Russia’s vow to respond — is actually just the second-most dangerous confrontation unfolding in that country.

Even more dangerous is that Israel and Iran, at the exact same time, seem to be heading for a High Noon shootout in Syria over Iran’s attempts to turn Syria into a forward air base against Israel, something Israel is vowing to never let happen. This is not mere speculation. In the past few weeks — for the first time ever — Israel and Iran have begun quietly trading blows directly, not through proxies, in Syria.

And this quiet phase may be about to end.

Israel and Iran are now a hair-trigger away from going to the next level — and if that happens, the U.S. and Russia may find it difficult to stay out.

This is a huge deal. It signals that the country is poised to consolidate the gains of decades of democracy. And the new interdenominational Christian cathedral will inspire ambitious civic architecture projects across the continent that harness the talents of Africa’s emerging artists.

Not everyone is cheering, though. Some West Africans have complained that the mixing of church and state is ill advised. They argue that it’s a worrisome case of official partisanship in a part of the world rived by religious conflicts. Others say the money for the project should have instead been invested in schools, hospitals and infrastructure — stuff that, according to them, Africa really needs. They are right to point to these endemic problems; but they are wrong to connect them with the cathedral.

The cathedral is the first major project in Africa by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who was knighted last year for his services to his field. He is perhaps the most exciting architect in the world. His reputation is built on his stunning designs for Rivington Place in London, the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, and, most spectacularly, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.

This Accra commission is not just a recognition by his homeland of Mr. Adjaye’s acclaim. It also signifies that Africa can build a major work by a leading architect at the top of his game. This is a remarkable thing: Ghana will get to brag about a globally recognized architectural landmark.The Fair Housing Act of 1968, which outlawed housing discrimination on paper, might have made amends for some of this history had the federal government actually enforced it. But studies continue to show pervasive discrimination in housing, and lower-income whites still have greater access than middle-class African-Americans to healthy mixed-income communities.

A study by the National Fair Housing Alliance of a dozen metropolitan areas — including Atlanta; Austin, Tex., Birmingham, Ala.; Chicago; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit; New York; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; San Antonio; and the District of Columbia — showed that real estate discrimination was pervasive.

The alliance filed a federal fair housing complaint against a real estate group in Jackson, Miss., charging that real estate agents were denying African-Americans the right to buy homes in high-value areas that would provide greater returns on their investments after testers posing as home buyers established that black and white clients were treated very differently. The real estate group settled the case by agreeing to specific steps to expand equal housing opportunities.

A HOME MORTGAGE ‘BLACK TAX’

African-Americans who had amassed equity in their homes and who should have been offered safe, reasonably priced loans were set up for default in the run-up to the recession, when they were targeted for predatory loans that were often deceptively marketed. A study of the problem in Baltimore found that black residents were charged higher rates and discriminated against at every stage of the transactions compared with comparably qualified white customers.

The authors determined that the loan default rate would have been considerably lower for black customers had they been treated in the same fashion as whites. Most tellingly of all, the study took into account factors like credit scores, income and down payments that would have been known to brokers and lenders when these abusive loans were made.

It comes as no surprise that such tactics took a heavy toll on black homeowners, who already lagged far behind whites in terms of wealth and homeownership levels. An analysis by the nonprofit Urban Institute shows that between 2001 and 2016 the homeownership rate for African-Americans declined about a five percentage points, to 41 percent, as opposed to just one percentage point for whites, whose rate fell to just over 71 percent. The nine percentage point decline for middle-aged black homeowners is particularly ominous, given that these people are closer to retirement with fewer resources to rely on.

The Urban Institute’s analysis of the black-white homeownership gap in 100 cities across the country shows that none have actually closed the ownership gap. The gap was widest in Northeastern and Midwestern cities — with the widest gaps, listed in order of severity, found in Minneapolis; Albany; Buffalo; New York; Salisbury, Md.; and Bridgeport, Conn. The cities with the smallest gaps were Killeen, Tex.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Charleston, S.C.; Austin; and Augusta, Ga.This is not to say that he lacked principles. The frequent descriptions of Ryan as a Jack Kemp acolyte — a supply-side tax cutter and entitlement reformer and free trader who imagined a more immigrant-welcoming and minority-friendly G.O.P. — were accurate enough; there was no question that the more a policy reflected Ryan’s deepest preferences, the more Kempist it would be.

But even there, he came to those principles at a time when they were ascendant within the party — in the period between the supply-side ’80s and the late-1990s window when centrist liberals seemed open to entitlement reform. And then as Republicans moved away from them, tacking now more compassionate-conservative, now more libertarian, now more Trumpist, his resistance to the drift was always gentle, eclipsed by his willingness to turn.

Thus the Ryan of the George W. Bush era cast votes for the pillars of compassionate conservatism, No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D. Then the Ryan of the Tea Party era championed austerity, talking about “makers and takers” and tossing out the Ayn Rand references that persuaded many liberals that he was an ideological fanatic. But that Ryan gave way to Ryan the dutiful running mate, which gave way in turn to the more moderate Ryan of Obama’s second term, who negotiated a budget deal with Democrats and moved toward so-called “reform conservatism” in his policy proposals at a time when that seemed like that might be the party’s future.

Then came the 2016 election, in which Ryan temporarily resisted Trump and then surrendered lest he break the party (which a party man could never do), and after that the Trump administration, in which Ryan has obviously steered Trump toward standard Republican policies — but has just as obviously been steered as well. Most of Ryan’s past big-picture goals (entitlement reform, free trade, minority outreach) are compromised or gone, and while he attempted Obamacare repeal and achieved a butchered version of corporate tax reform, he’s accepted spending policies that make a mockery of any sort of libertarian or limited-government goal.

If you look at all this and see an obsessive ideologue working tirelessly for Randian ends, I think you’re being daft. But it’s equally daft to see this as the story of a great visionary brought low by Trump. The truth is that Ryan probably could have thrived as a legislator in a variety of dispensations: As a Reaganite if he’d been born early enough; as a Kempian or compassionate conservative if the late-1990s boom had continued; as a bipartisan dealmaker in a world where his base supported compromises (the blueprints he drew up with Democrats like Ron Wyden were usually interesting); as some sort of reform-conservative-inflected figure under a President Rubio or Kasich.Friedkin used a hand-held camera to film an interview with Father Amorth, the chief Vatican exorcist, who worried that “Satan rules the world” and was in the Vatican. He died in 2016 at 91.

The director, who had never seen an exorcism, also talked the priest into letting him film the exorcism of an Italian architect named Christina with whom he had done the ancient ritual many times.

“It was harrowing,” Friedkin says. “These five strong guys are holding her down. They’re sweating. Father Amorth told me that during one of the exorcisms, she accused him of his sins and they were real.”

Friedkin took this footage to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists, and one psychiatrist challenged it, saying Christina did not show “the classic symptoms” of possession, such as her head turning 360 degrees and her body levitating.

“I said, ‘Doctor, we made that up,’” Friedkin recalls dryly. “Blatty invented what we think of as possession and exorcism today, and I had to find a way to film it. Father Amorth never encountered stuff like that, but he encountered other extraordinary occurrences and personality changes and voice changes. But there was no levitation or head spinning.”

The filmmaker says that for his documentary he did nothing to amplify the guttural growl of Christina, which evokes the terrifying voice used by Mercedes McCambridge, which was dubbed in for Blair’s in the possession scenes.

“When she breathed into the mic, you’d hear five or six sounds come out at once, like John Coltrane playing the sax,” he says. “When I first called her, she said, ‘I’m in A.A. I had a serious drinking problem. I am a lapsed Catholic, but I still have strong ties to the church. So in order to do what you want, I’m going to have to start drinking Jack Daniel’s again and smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.’ And she wanted to have her own two priests with her at all times.”Several candidates who are mothers cite fears for their children as the root of their support or opposition to gun control. Kelda Roys, who is running in a crowded primary for governor of Wisconsin, described picking up her daughter at preschool and hearing about how she had to hide and be very quiet. Her 3-year-old was describing an active-shooter drill.

Women running for office in both parties have long used their status as mothers to explain their policy stances. Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire, ran an ad that cited her children as a reason to cut wasteful spending, said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at the Center for American Women and Politics. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, who gave birth to three children while in Congress, cited her son’s Down syndrome to object to those who would abort fetuses with the condition.

By and large, though, Republican portraits of motherhood have tended to be more traditional, Ms. Dittmar said.

By contrast, this newest group of Democratic candidates seems more outspoken and unconventional. They do not appear to be concerned about research suggesting that motherhood should be conveyed in safe doses — some pictures of the children but not too many lest voters doubt women’s credentials.

Take the breast-feeding videos. In one, Ms. Roys calmly lifts her sweater and lets her fussing baby nurse, while discussing a bill she helped pass in the Wisconsin Legislature banning BPA, a suspected carcinogen, from baby bottles.

In another, Krish Vignarajah, who is hoping to prevail in a crowded Democratic primary to face Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, breast-feeds her baby and declares, “There are no women in statewide or federal office in Maryland.” A former policy director for Michelle Obama, Ms. Vignarajah cuts to other scenes of her behind a desk, lists policies, then ends with another breast-feeding shot: “Some say no man can beat Larry Hogan. Well, I’m no man. I’m a mom, I’m a woman and I want to be your next governor.”

Political consultants say that they sense a hunger among many voters for breaking with political conventions and traditional backgrounds for office — the same impatience with politics as usual that made Mr. Trump appealing to his base. So mothers as well as business executives (and some are one and the same) can fit the bill.

Margie Omero, a political consultant, said such portrayals fit with more frankness about a range of topics in society now — sexual harassment in the #MeToo era and conversations about racism — “feeling that your untold story is important to tell.”

Motherhood has long been a political constraint as well as a political advantage. “We don’t see a celebration of women when they advocate for themselves and their grievances, we see it if they advocate for others,” said Jill S. Greenlee, the author of “The Political Consequences of Motherhood” and a political scientist at Brandeis. “When someone says ‘I’m running for office because I’m a mom,’ it re-entrenches that women ought to be moms.”

But she, like others, sees shifts in the political landscape. Some of the new female candidates are younger and have not spent years working their way up from local to state to national political posts. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, said her mother, Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, had to bank her political ambitions for years.

“My mom would be thrilled to see that women aren’t waiting their turn — they’re just jumping in,” she said. “Back in the day, a woman had to have an entire résumé of accomplishments, three times as long as a man running. A lot of things that women already do — running the PTA, raising children, balancing a job and a family — those are all attributes that make them highly qualified to be in elective office.”

Motherhood can be a credential, but research also suggests that women have to work harder to persuade voters that they have expertise in realms like national security. A study conducted by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation during the 2016 election found voters had the deepest misgivings about mothers with young children, but not about men with young families.

This newest wave of candidates seems undeterred by this thinking — and perhaps is poised to toss it out entirely. “Women are going with their gut,” said Barbara Lee, the foundation’s president. “They’re running as if these obstacles haven’t taken place in the past. It’s their sense of urgency about changing the status quo.”

The status quo, of course, is quite stubbornly in place. This raw portrait of the realities of motherhood as a political calling card doesn’t go over with everyone.

Ms. Roys, the breast-feeding mother running for governor in Wisconsin, said she is still sometimes asked who would take care of her young children if she were to win. One man running for state attorney general told her that he never gets that question.Several candidates who are mothers cite fears for their children as the root of their support or opposition to gun control.

This battle between striving and serenity may be distinctly American. The struggle between toil and the dream of ease is an American birthright, the way a Frenchman expects to have decent wine at a reasonable price, and the whole month of August on vacation.

Maybe it goes all the way back to the Declaration of Independence, our founding document. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. How proud I’ve always been, through the years of protesting, the radical this and progressive that of my 1960s generation, to think of those words.

That unlikely word — happiness — made me proud to be an American, not just for my own sake, but that everyone was enjoined to find a personal project of delight. Of course happiness is an illusion. Still, I’ll pledge allegiance to it.

But happiness is the only word in the Declaration of Independence triad that doesn’t stand alone. Happiness is not, like life and liberty, a given. Happiness in the American credo is a job. It must be pursued. It may not be clear what happiness is, but you better get hold of it. Your fault, sucker, if you can’t somehow nab it for yourself.

The essential American word isn’t happiness. It’s pursuit.

This is where the struggle is engaged, happiness as a national enterprise. Its pursuit is the loneliness coiled within the heart of the American dream.

Even a postmodern to-do list is not the answer. Go ahead — meditate, do yoga, eat probiotic foods, all that.

But how about just giving up? What about wasting time? Giving up or perhaps giving over. To what? Perhaps what an earlier age called “the life of the mind,” the phrase that describes the sovereign self at ease, at home in the world. This isn’t the mind of rational thought, but the lost music of wondering, the sheer value of looking out the window, letting the world float along. It’s nothing, really, this wasted time, which is how it becomes, paradoxically, charged with “everything,” liberated into the blessed loss of ambition.This makes me think — have people who used this term ever actually met any Vietnamese people? Been to a Vietnamese restaurant, much less a Vietnamese household or Vietnam itself? We’re really, really loud.

The situation, now and in the past, is that the minority and marginalized communities of this or any other country are often not voiceless. They’re simply not heard.

That’s the problem with being called a voice for the voiceless, whose exceptional status is related to what we call genius. We would rather deal with a solo voice than a chorus, or a cacophony, of voices. And in praising today’s voice for the voiceless, we would just as soon forget, or not even know about, all the other voices for the voiceless that came before.

I think back to Edith Maude Eaton, half-Chinese and half-white, who adopted a Chinese pen name and wrote as Sui Sin Far. She advocated for Chinese immigrants and chose to be Chinese in the early years of the 20th century, at a time when to be Chinese was to be despised in North America. She published one book of short stories, “Mrs. Spring Fragrance,” and died in poverty and obscurity at an early age in 1914.

I think back to Carlos Bulosan, who migrated from the Philippines in the 1930s as a colonial ward of the United States. He worked as a journalist and a labor organizer and became a nationally celebrated writer. His fame peaked with his book “America Is in the Heart” in 1946. By 1954, however, suspected of having Communist sympathies, he was a target of McCarthyism. He died poor and alone, of pneumonia.

I think back to John Okada, who fought in World War II even though his Japanese-American family was in an internment camp. Okada came back from the war and published “No No Boy” in 1957, the first novel dealing with the little-known story of Japanese-American draft resisters. America did not want to think about the internment, and the Japanese-American community, intent on being patriotic, did not want to acknowledge draft resisters. “No No Boy” immediately disappeared. Okada died relatively young and his widow, in despair at his rejection, burned his second manuscript.

Those are three of the most iconic Asian-American writers, and I wish genius grants were retroactive. It took genius to decide to write about Asian-Americans at a time when there was no market for Asian-American literature, no recognition for Asian-American writers, and when there weren’t even any Asian-Americans. (Until the 1960s, we were collectively Orientals.)

Thinking back to writers like Sui Sin Far, Carlos Bulosan and John Okada, it is clear that genius is too often unrecognized in its day. I know my good luck is at least partly due to the sacrifice of writers who came before me.“Content had appeared that did not accord with core socialist values and was not a good guide for public opinion,” Mr. Zhang wrote. “Over the past few years, we put more effort and resources toward expanding the business, and did not take enough measures to supervise our platform.”

He added that Bytedance would expand its team for monitoring content to 10,000 people from 6,000 currently.

The company’s travails show how the government in Beijing has broadened its restrictions on what people see and say on the internet. Regulators are increasingly suppressing content that they deem pornographic or in poor taste, and not merely material that touches on politically sensitive topics such as regime change or personal freedoms.

The authorities are also scrambling to keep up as a new wave of Chinese apps, many of them built around short, spontaneously recorded video clips or live streams, helps people communicate and express themselves in new and hard-to-supervise ways.

Bytedance — which investors valued at more than $30 billion recently, putting it more in the financial league of Airbnb or SpaceX than of Buzzfeed or Vice — has assembled a confederation of these buzzy new apps. And it has made no secret of its desire to dominate phone screens across the rest of the world, too.

The company says it uses artificial intelligence technology to figure out what users like, then makes sure they are fed more and more of it. Read a few articles on the trade spat between the United States and China, and soon your Toutiao feed will be populated with news on international relations. Watch a bunch of stand-up comedy shows, and before long the app will suggest new comics who might appeal.

Bytedance has spent top dollar hiring engineers and software experts to fine-tune its recommendation technology.

“It’s like having a chef in your house who knows what kind of food you like,” said Xu Qinglu, a 22-year-old student and Toutiao user in Beijing.

“I think the app is not harmful,” she added. “The people who use it should be responsible for their own behavior.”

At an event in Beijing last month, Mr. Zhang said he hoped that more than half of the company’s users would come from outside China within the next three years. At the moment, he said, one in 10 of its users was overseas.

First, though, the company needs to continue thriving in China. Bytedance’s detractors say that salty, unwholesome material — the sort that has the Chinese government on edge these days — is exactly what the company’s apps have specialized in, and is a major reason for its popularity.

“Will a cleaned-up Toutiao still have an edge?” said Neil Arora, an American investor who previously worked in venture capital in Beijing.

“Toutiao’s strong team, refined algorithms and locked-in users may help it adapt,” said Mr. Arora, who is not a Bytedance shareholder. “However, the bigger danger is that all news apps may lose out, with users pulling away from sanitized news feeds for entertainment elsewhere.”

Hans Tung of GGV Capital, a venture firm that operates in both China and the United States and is a Bytedance shareholder, said he was confident the company would continue to add more types of material — not just the lowbrow kind — to its platforms. “The Toutiao we see today is not the Toutiao it will be five years from now,” he said.

“It’s better to go through this rodeo a few times,” Mr. Tung said of the latest rebuke from regulators. This way, he said, the company will be motivated to move more quickly in courting users who want higher-minded stuff.

Toutiao aside, three other popular news apps — including one run by Tencent, the giant Chinese conglomerate — were also taken down from stores this week.

Another fast-growing video app, Kuaishou, was removed last week alongside Huoshan, and also for featuring videos made by teenage mothers. In response, Kuaishou’s parent company said it would increase the size of its content-monitoring team to 5,000 from 2,000.

A posting from Kuaishou on one hiring website last week says the company is looking for people with bachelor’s degrees or higher. Candidates with “good political awareness” and “strong political sensitivity and discernment” are preferred. Being a member of the Communist Party or Communist Youth League is also a plus, the listing says.

Duanzi, Bytedance’s now-shuttered humor app, trafficked in dirty jokes, goofy comedy sketches and well-worn but persistent gender stereotypes. One post that appeared on the app before it was closed down declared that the way to know that a man won’t cheat on his wife is to place a beautiful woman before him — but the way to test a woman’s fidelity is to try seducing her with a lot of money.

Another post, unprintable in a family newspaper, was a ribald joke involving a seller of fried dough sticks, his wife and an irate customer.

Even Bytedance’s news app, Toutiao, featured plenty of edgy material that kept users coming back, sometimes reluctantly, for more. Xiao Lin, a 29-year-old programmer in Beijing, called the app “spiritual opium.”

“On a typical night, I would keep clicking on news items the app recommended to me while telling myself, ‘After this, I will sleep,’ ” Mr. Xiao said. “But I ended up reading more and more, for hours. I couldn’t stop.”

He deleted the app in January.On Saturday night, a small crowd filled a 120-seat theater in Fremont, Calif., to watch a movie unlike any other on the big screen, one that offers a fresh look at a tragic chapter in American history.

The nine-minute silent film, much of it previously thought to be lost, shows the ruins left by the earthquake that ravaged San Francisco 112 years ago, according to David Kiehn, a film historian who helped to identify and restore the footage, which he said was originally shot by the pioneering Miles Brothers film studio in San Francisco.That fall, he left college and went to study dance at Juilliard. In addition to Graham and Limón, who were both on the faculty, he came into the orbit of the British ballet choreographer Antony Tudor, whom he still considers one of his strongest influences. Tudor taught his students that physical skill and technique, however necessary, were merely tools for revealing deeper meaning, an idea that resonated with the young Lubovitch, as did Tudor’s emphasis on visualizing the music as he danced. “It was about being the music,” Mr. Lubovitch said.

His eclectic and compressed training — he spent only two years at Juilliard — also meant that he didn’t have time to absorb the enmity that simmered between modern dance and ballet, two artistic camps that looked upon each other with suspicion. (To a certain extent, they still do.) “To me it was all dance,” he said. His own choreography embraces both the grace and line of ballet and the weight and purposefulness of modern dance. For him, there is no tension among abstraction, beauty and honest expression. (He has at times been criticized as sentimental, not that he minds, he said.) Nor has he shied away from making dance to “important” classical music, including compositions by Brahms, Schubert, Schumann and Mozart, composers often considered too monumental for dance.

The following are edited excerpts from a conversation looking back at his 50-year choreographic career.

You discovered dance as a freshman at the University of Iowa. How did it happen?

Marsha Thayer, who was a choreographer, dancer and teacher, came into my gymnastics warm-up one day and asked if there were any men there who would like to lift some women. That was how she put it. It was intriguing enough. She took me to my first dance concert, and it happened to be the Limón Dance Company. I remember everything they performed: “There Is a Time,” “The Emperor Jones” and “The Moor’s Pavane.”

Why has musical expression been so central to your idea of dance?

Music visualization sounds so corny now, but I do think it’s a bottom line of why people dance. Something about music filling our spirit and our having a physical reaction to it. But it’s spoken of less, and in certain circles it’s thought of as very old-fashioned.

Early on, in addition to dancing with Donald McKayle, Pearl Lang, John Butler and various ballet companies, you were a go-go dancer at a nightclub in Greenwich Village. What was that like?

Yes, Trude Heller’s. I wore white bell-bottoms and white go-go boots. In those days, go-go dancers stood on a ledge above the dance floor and demonstrated the latest dances. I was really good at it. Go-go dancing was where my spirit of dance came alive. I became more interested in choreographing because there was no other place I could dance where I felt that free.

Did you always think of yourself as a choreographer?

I made up my first dance when I was about 3. I first heard the word “choreography” as a child in a movie theater with my parents. It was a movie with Danny Kaye and he was doing a parody of Martha Graham, and the name of the dance parody was “Choreography.” I asked my father, “What does that word mean?” And he said, “That’s the guy who makes up the steps.”

What qualities do you value in movement?

My style of movement is very fluid. I always knew that one step had to come out of another, with a sense of inevitability. All of the movement comes out of itself and delivers the next idea.

You’ve said that “A Brahms Symphony” (1985) was a turning point for you. In what way?

Dance was exploding, and things were going in this much more conceptual direction. And I had to ask myself, was that really me or not? And I said, no, it isn’t me. So I went in the opposite direction and took this music by Brahms and did this very passionate, very sentimental, very physically expressive dance. It was a statement to myself and whoever was watching that this was my truth.

Some of your most well-received dances, like the duet from “Concerto Six Twenty-Two” (1986), “Men’s Stories” (2000) and “Little Rhapsodies” (2007), were made for men.

I like the way men dance, and I like women who dance like men. What I mean by that is that they have gravity and weight in their movement. So what I really like is a dancer who has gravity in both senses of the word: physical gravity and spiritual gravity.

You were also a pioneer in same-sex partnering. “Concerto Six Twenty-Two,” for example, contains a very moving pas de deux for two men. How did that come about?

We were at the beginnings of what was clearly going to be a worldwide crisis of AIDS. I had lost a close friend already. I thought that one of the emerging themes was friendship. People, very young people who didn’t expect to escort their friends to death, were helping people to die out of friendship. So I decided to do a dance that was basically about honoring friendship. The central duet was for two men, and the whole dance is about that. It resonated.

What is the idea behind your newest piece, “Something About Night”?

It’s composed of fragments of many dances I’ve done over the years, little moments in duets and trios. But mainly, my motivation was that I want to be quiet. I think I value quiet now. And in this dance, I’m seeking a quieting of the mind.

You’ve also taken up curating dance; you started the Chicago Dancing Festival in 2006, and now you’ve begun a new festival, NY Quadrille, at the Joyce. How do you see the current state of dance?

There are a lot of people making really, really good, deep dance right now in spite of the economic climate. On the ballet stage as well. We’ve seen a plateau for some time, but a plateau is just the place you know someone will use as a springboard. It’s inevitable. Art always moves forward.6. Take note of their other worries. All immigrants are afraid of not making it. They’ve washed dishes in restaurants or tended the counter of a gas station. They’ve experienced dislocation, heartsickness and uncertainty. They want to spare you that life. But remember that you can navigate the world in ways unimaginable to them.

7. If, at any moment, you feel yourself expecting understanding from them, stop. Ask yourself: Why do I need it? Accept that you may never get it. Transcendent perfect understanding, as a goal, is out of the question. Maybe you’re thinking, but I know a family like that! They’re the nicest! Consider: Doesn’t the child seem weirdly lacking in edge? A little too well adjusted and cheerful? (Note: These are the perfect people to marry; marry them.) Your parents gave you this edge. Because of your relationship, you know how to fight — you know how to articulate what you believe and withstand skepticism. You’ll thank them some day.

8. If you hope to deepen your relationship, ask them questions. What did they want to become when they were younger? What was the political situation? Was it a just world? What was hard about coming here? If you don’t know their native tongue, try to speak it, even if that means you have to fumble and be uncomfortable. (Welcome to their lives!) If your parents tell you not to bother learning their language, this should break your heart.

9. Remember that what persuades them is your stability. By definition, that takes years to prove. On some profound level, they know they can’t argue with the fact that you’re happy.

10. But you may not, in fact, find happiness. You may not like the choices you believed they failed to understand — it may be you who fails. Prepare yourself for what they will say. Thought you could change the world? Thought you could do what you love and still pay rent? We told you so!

11. Let them say it.

12. In theory, parents know you most intimately. In practice, they often have no idea how much they hurt you. They feel, rather, that it is you who have hurt them. And this impasse is painful, because in a battle where both feel betrayed, victory is Pyrrhic.

13. I wish I could say: You can disobey them and win their love. I wish I could promise you that your choices are the right ones, and that you won’t come to doubt them. But winning and certainty are actually not the point. The point is: Do you believe that failure is yours to have, rather than theirs to fear?

14. Have faith. There is a long game. They might never see things the way you do, and that’s O.K. Show them love as best you can. Show up for them, and the things that they care about, in the ways that you are able. After all, when you were a baby, they bathed you, wiped your nose, cut your food into tiny little chunks so that you wouldn’t choke and fed the stuff straight into your mouth. And someday, maybe you’ll get to do that for them.Does anyone use these adaptive tests?

The GRE and G.M.A.T. graduate exams are adaptive tests, as is the Smarter Balanced test some states use to measure Common Core skills in grades 3 to 11. Language placement exams are often adaptive, as are licensing exams for pharmacists, accountants, paramedics and other professions.

What’s the holdup on going adaptive?

Just to go online has required exhaustive studies and statistical analysis to ensure comparability of a paper exam score with one from a computer, time the test loading and scrolling speeds of various laptops, and assure that computerized testing doesn’t work to the advantage of some groups of students over others.

Learning: A Special Section Welcome to the new Learning section — a deep dive into the joys, excitement, challenges and opportunities in the world of education and learning. This is the first of four refreshed and redesigned sections we will publish this year. Drawing on the commitment to the subject and the expertise across The New York Times, we want Learning to be a place where educators, students and parents can join a vigorous conversation around the best ways to educate people, whether children or adults. (You can reach us at learningsection@nytimes.com with comments and ideas.) - Jane Bornemeier, Editor

Beyond that, adaptive testing also demands a much larger store of potential questions.

If my school gives the SAT or ACT online, can I request a paper version instead?

If the school opts for online testing, only students granted special accommodations for a disability can take it on paper. But schools may opt for a mixed mode of ACT testing, which would allow students to choose.

Digital ACT and SAT tests are given on more than one day. Are they different tests, and if not, what’s to prevent students sharing questions and answers online?

Both companies declined to answer, citing test security, but said they take many steps to protect against cheating and ensure a fair testing environment.

Is scratch paper allowed? Does the online test have any useful features that paper tests don’t?

Both tests allow pencils and scratch paper. Both tests allow you to bookmark items to return to later and have a countdown clock to keep track of time left in the section. The ACT lets you cross off answers you want to eliminate, and it marks unanswered questions with an orange dot, while the SAT provides electronic scratch paper and the ability to highlight passages.

Where can I test drive an online test?

For the ACT, visit the TestNav website, home.testnav.com. Students also may access timed and untimed ACTs to become comfortable with the testing, using Preparing for the ACT Test Taken Online. For the SAT, the College Board recommends Official SAT Practice on Khan Academy, www.satpractice.org. Students also are given practice questions on the actual AIR test platform ahead of test day.Maralinga, which means “thunder” in the extinct Aboriginal language Garik, is an unlikely tourist destination. It is hot and arid, and at 700 miles west of Adelaide it is difficult to reach. When tours started in 2016, the village was accessible by only two flights a week from Ceduna, the closest “large” city, which itself has a population of fewer than 3,000 people.

But the Maralinga Tjarutja people hope to increase the number of visitors to the site this year. The Maralinga Tjarutja Administration, which operates the site, is increasing the number of regular flights to the village, increasing the length of the tour to three days and working with the South Australian government on a business plan to lure more visitors, said Sharon Yendall, the group’s general manager.

Don Richards, who served at Maralinga as a clerk in the Australian Air Force from 1963 to 1965, was one of the 1,000 tourists who have so far visited the site.

“I learned more in that tour than I really learned in the two years I was out there,” he said. “It was a pretty interesting place to be — a fairly motley crew lived at Maralinga once.”

Today just four people live full time in Maralinga village, a veritable ghost town. Amid the old buildings are new lodgings built for tourists, complete with hot water and Wi-Fi.

In the 1950s and ’60s, at the height of the Cold War, 35,000 military personnel lived here. There was a permanent airstrip, then the longest in the Southern Hemisphere, plus roads, a swimming pool, accommodation and railway access.

The first nuclear test was conducted in September 1956, two months before the Melbourne Olympics. That blast — as powerful as the bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima, Japan — was the first of seven atomic bombs set off here.

But it was the so-called minor tests that were the most harrowing. Carried out in secret, the tests examined how toxic substances, including uranium and plutonium 239, would react when burned or blown up. To ensure tourists’ safety in the area, a zone was cleaned up by radiation scientists at the cost of more than 100 million Australian dollars, about $77 million.

Around one area tourists can visit are 22 major pits, each at least 50 feet deep and cased in reinforced concrete to prevent dangerous radiation from seeping out.

The site looks like a recently tilled garden bed, stretching out for hundreds of yards, in a near perfect circle. Dotting the red desert earth are shards of twisted metal. Aside from a few feral camels loping nearby, it is still and silent.

But on Oct. 4 1956, a “nuclear land mine” was detonated here, tearing a crater 140 feet wide and 70 feet deep into the earth.

The resulting atomic reaction took only a fraction of a second, but its effects on one indigenous family would last decades.

In early 1957, Edie Millpuddie and her family were traversing the Great Victoria Desert plains. “The Millpuddies needed shelter for the night, and they came across this enormous hole where the ground was still warm,” Mr. Mathews said. “They drank rainwater from the bottom and lit a fire. All the rabbits in the area seemed disoriented; they were easy pickings for dinner before the family went to sleep in the crater.”

Two weeks later, Ms. Millpuddie delivered a stillborn baby.The tide has turned, venture capitalists said. “I talk to bankers all the time and they’re like: ‘Dude, we have stuff coming down the pike. There’s a bunch of offerings teed up,’” said Rob Hayes, a general partner at First Round Capital, who led a $1.5 million funding round in Uber in 2010 that valued the company at $4 million. Uber is now worth $68 billion.

Some of the biggest-name privately held tech companies have recently made moves that position them to go public in the next year or two. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has said he plans to take the company public next year. Lyft has held talks with investment banks to explore going public. And Airbnb has begun bringing independent directors onto its board, a move that is typically part of the preparations for becoming a public company.

A wave of tech I.P.O.s would have implications for Silicon Valley’s start-up ecosystem. Once start-ups go public and their employees pocket some of the wealth, executives and engineers may leave with more resources to begin their own start-ups. That gives venture capitalists a fresh set of companies to invest in, renewing the cycles of innovation and experimentation that sit at the heart of Silicon Valley.

The I.P.O.s will also earn the venture capitalists big returns — and bragging rights. According to an annual ranking of venture capitalists by CB Insights, a research firm that follows start-ups and venture capital, many of the top-ranked investors backed companies with 2017 I.P.O.s, including the software maker MuleSoft; Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service; and Snap. (While Snap has struggled on the stock market, investors bought in at far lower valuations.)

At the top of the CB Insights list for the second straight year was Bill Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark, which was a Stitch Fix backer and one of the biggest investors in Uber. (Mr. Gurley became embroiled in plenty of drama with Uber last year, including filing a fraud lawsuit against its former chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Benchmark recently sold some shares of Uber to SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate.)

Steve Anderson of Baseline Ventures, No. 2 on the list, also backed Stitch Fix. And Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Ventures, who was No. 10, funded Snap, while his colleague Ravi Mhatre, No. 8, backed MuleSoft and Stitch Fix. (The list of top 20 venture capitalists is below.)

“Even though most firms have had fairly record numbers over the past four or five years, they’ve been paper numbers,” Mr. Gurley said. “At the end of day, cash-on-cash returns is what matters.”

While private capital has been so accessible that start-ups have been able to get ample funding without the headaches of an I.P.O., several factors are encouraging companies to go public now, investors and bankers said. Public investors are hungry to buy shares of fast-growing companies. Early employees are getting antsy to cash in their stakes. And some start-up executives are eager to prove themselves as public company chief executives after founders like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey have said going public improved their discipline and focus on profits.

“At all levels, there are more and more companies who are thinking about should we go public this year or next?” said Noah Wintroub, JPMorgan Chase’s vice chairman of investment banking. “You’ve got an environment now that’s conducive to asking that question, and also a lot of companies that have scaled up to the point where they can go now.”

Matthew Kennedy, an I.P.O. analyst at Renaissance Capital, said nearly all private companies valued at more than $1 billion were strong candidates to go public in the next two years. He said he expected more immediate activity among midsize start-ups, such as Slack, the maker of corporate messaging software, which is valued at $5.1 billion, and DocuSign, an e-signature company valued at $3 billion that filed I.P.O. paperwork last month.

Large private Chinese firms may also be nearing I.P.O.s, Mr. Kennedy said, including Xiaomi, a smartphone maker valued at $46 billion, and Meituan Dianping, an e-commerce firm valued at $30 billion.

Once this generation of start-ups goes public, investors said, it will ease the anxiety of the wealthy families, pension funds and university endowments that finance the venture capitalists’ investment funds. Those so-called limited partners have been itching for their returns, venture capitalists said.

“They’re certainly eager for cash back,” said Mr. Pressman, the Zuora investor. An I.P.O. boon would be good for the venture capitalists, too.

“For sure,” he said. “We’re in the business to make money for our investors, but we make money when our investors do.”

The Top 20 Venture Capitalists

CB Insights analyzed investors’ exits (I.P.O.s, stock sales and acquisitions) the value of their current holdings and other factors to rank the top 100 venture capitalists. The analysis spanned 2009 through March 2018. The New York Times presents the top 20 here:A group called Salty Terror demonstrated voice-guided recipe instruction, which sounded as if Siri had entered a surgical theater. (“Three mid-sized prep bowls.” “Next.” “Strainer.” “Next.” “Knife. “Repeat.” “Knife.”) Another, named G1 after the original Android phone, proposed a menu scanner for easier tracking of SmartPoints in restaurants.

This pleased Ms. Grossman, who is also on the board of directors of the casual-dining conglomerate that owns Outback Steakhouse. “I remind them all the time that if Bloomin’ Onion is 75 points, they need to work on some healthy options,” she said, referring to the battered and deep-fried concoction cut like a flower and served with a mayonnaise-based dipping sauce.

Most captivating was a team addressing the practice of privately pecking points and ingredients into smartphones. “Why does it have to be so awkward to do Weight Watchers with friends?” a product designer wondered rhetorically. “What if there were an easier, more social and more interactive way?”

With their solution, you would never track alone, but rather share “Swishpoints! From my phone to your phone in one quick … ssss … swish!”

“Ahhhh!” murmured the crowd admiringly.

A presenter described User A (a “swisher”) imparting a menu to User B (a “swishee”), with herself hypothetically subtracting the wine from the menu — as if Edward Albee’s “Three Tall Women” had suddenly been outfitted with iPhones and concerns about their body mass indexes. (Wine, incidentally, is the second most common drink tracked by members, outranked only by coffee.)

Soon after came a team called The Incredibles, proposing a sort of match.com for sharing recipes. “Swiping right adds it to your ‘soul foods,’” said the lead Incredible. “Mindy is always talking about personalization. I don’t mean to call you out,” he said to the top boss, “but it’s true.”

Ms. Grossman grabbed the microphone. “Personalization,” she stage-whispered, to hearty chuckles.

From Disco to Diller

Ms. Grossman’s tenure of just under a year has not all been so lighthearted. In February, she encountered her first public relations crisis when Weight Watchers announced during a global employee event that it planned to offer free six-week memberships to teenagers. The well-oiled social media opprobrium machine heaved into gear, with the Balance Eating Disorder Treatment Center introducing an aggrieved hashtag, #wakeupweightwatchers, and the Academy for Eating Disorders posting an open letter to Ms. Grossman that cited studies linking restrictive diets during adolescence to potentially severe mental and physical consequences.

The following month, Oprah Winfrey — who in 2015 bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers, along with becoming its spokeswoman — sold a quarter of that stake, prompting speculation about her long-term involvement. (Ms. Winfrey later said that she was donating some of those shares to a charity and that she remained committed to the company.)

Sitting in a fabric-lined boardroom with the company’s senior vice president of corporate communications, Stacie Sherer, Ms. Grossman was as measured as a cup of popcorn (up to two SmartPoints) about the teenager kerfuffle.

“Whenever you do anything that’s different from the norm, you’ll have some people who think it’s the most incredible thing in the world, that you’re going to help generations get healthy,” she said. “And then you’re going to have some people who want to weigh in thinking that we’re putting the teenagers of the world on a diet which is exactly what we’re not doing.” She cited the company’s consultation with pediatric experts. “There’s nothing that we’re going to do that’s not rooted in science, and that doesn’t make sense,” she said, “ and so it’s just a matter of clarification and communication.”

She herself was an awkward-aged 14-year-old in the Long Island town of Valley Stream when she attended her first Weight Watchers meeting, taken there by her mother, Elaine Waldman, a homemaker who struggled with health problems as well as the scale. “It was mostly women just having a conversation about food and how they felt, and I remember listening to other people and supporting other people,” Ms. Grossman said. She lost about 10 pounds on the program, felt better about herself and joined her high school’s cheerleading squad.

Mindy’s father, Donald Waldman, worked nights for Candy Brand Tomatoes in St. Albans, Queens; he and her mother had tried unsuccessfully for a dozen years to have a baby on their own and hadn’t been able to afford adoption until one night his boss gave him a check earmarked for that purpose. Told this story for as long as she could remember, their daughter developed a strong sense of filial obligation. She went to Manhattanville College a year early, transferring to George Washington University as a senior, and majored in English literature and philosophy with plans to become a lawyer.

A sudden, if unfocused, epiphany came after a summer working as receptionist and occasional fit model for the company that made Nik Nik, the brightly patterned polyester shirts popular during the disco years. She broke an engagement to her high-school boyfriend and telephoned her parents.

“I’m moving to New York,” she announced, to horrified silence.

Her graduation was in 1977, when the city was dangerous and dirty. She found an assistant job at another shirt company, Manhattan Industries, which paid $15,600 a year, and moved into a 330-square-foot studio apartment in an elevator building on First Avenue between 73rd and 74th Streets. The long bus ride to the west side cost 50 cents. “I’d be scrounging, looking for the quarter,” said Ms. Grossman, who is currently renovating a $5.65 million condo at United Nations Plaza.

She moonlighted one winter as a server at Cachaca, a nightclub on 62nd Street above the better-known discothèque Hippopotamus, to make extra cash for the holidays. “You know what? It was fabulous,” she said.

Her career in shirts progressed to the men’s wear brand Enro. One day, the fashion designer Jeffrey Banks arrived there for a meeting and spotted Mindy Waldman handling a busy front desk. “I watched this young woman — 21, 22 years of age — dealing with irate salespeople and messengers, doing it so calmly and efficiently — I was just so captivated by her,” he said in a phone interview. She would eventually become his vice president of sales, part of a rare convergence of talent that included the then-unknown designers John Varvatos and Isaac Mizrahi.

Later, she worked for Willi Smith, a lover of bright color who collaborated with artists like Barbara Kruger and Keith Haring. “Literally the first designer to really articulate that fashions should come from the street up not the top down,” Ms. Grossman said. “To bring democratization to fashion, before Target ever thought of it.”

Mr. Smith died of AIDS-related causes in the spring of 1987. Later that year, a month before her 30th birthday, Mindy Waldman married Neil Grossman, a mathematical physicist turned lawyer turned financier. They have a grown daughter, Elysabeth, nicknamed Lizzy, and a 15-month-old granddaughter, Emma. “It’s fabulous, it’s so unbelievable, I’m obsessed,” Ms. Grossman said, adding brightly of Lizzy: “And she’s on the whole Freestyle and loves it, because a lot of today’s young moms, they have to be healthy for their kids.” (Under the Weight Watchers Freestyle system introduced in December, more than 200 foods including beans, peas, chicken breast and seemingly every fish in the sea can be consumed with wanton abandon.)

She went from Mr. Smith’s company to then-fledgling Tommy Hilfiger, as vice president of sales and marketing, and then to the aesthetically similar Ralph Lauren as the president of its bridge line, Chaps. Later, she started Polo Jeans, which was directed at young people, and which has remained one of Mr. Lauren’s most successful and enduring brand extensions.

Ms. Grossman’s next stop was Nike, where she expanded the apparel business by over a billion dollars, with a particular focus on women’s wear.

But she was eager to be a chief executive, and after a recruiter from Barry Diller’s InterActive Corp. contacted her about heading its retail division, she sold Mr. Diller on a plan to revive the then-ossified Home Shopping Network.

Vodka and Cereal

Inspired by the chatty format of her favorite cooking shows, Ms. Grossman brought higher-end labels and A-list celebrities including Jennifer Lopez and Serena Williams to the channel, along with much-heralded new Herman Miller Aeron chairs. In August 2008, spun off from IAC by Mr. Diller, Home Shopping Network went public. A month later came the fall of Lehman Brothers and subsequent international financial crisis.

“All I could think about were the 6,000 people that worked for the company — their families, their future,” she said. “I was so stressed out.”

For the next year, Ms. Grossman focused on bolstering company spirit. “Number one, there’s never any bad news on H.S.N.,” she reassured her employees. “Number two, even if somebody cannot afford to do business right now, I want them to think that we’re a place they could go to be a part of the community, or interface with the brands they love, because it’s the nature of the business, and it’s not about selling.”

She remained there over a decade, and the network’s fortunes mostly rose. With waterfront property in St. Petersburg, Fla. and a house with vineyard in Millbrook, N.Y., Ms. Grossman considered retirement, but the opportunity to run Weight Watchers intrigued her. The financial returns are less important to her, she insisted, than freshening a brand that, with its cruises and oft-deserted storefronts, some considered as stale as an outdated package of SandwichThins (three SmartPoints).

“I’m not the turnaround girl — I’m the transformation-growth person,” she said.

On Thursday, Ms. Winfrey, a little out of breath after a 45-minute run, praised Ms. Grossman, one of around five candidates brought to her by a search firm. “She’s an executor and a doer, not just a sayer and a talker,” Ms. Winfrey said during a phone interview.

“The thing that did it for me was that she understood immediately that it was a lifestyle and not a diet, and that we were still operating as though it was a diet,” she went on. “She said the same things that I had also felt and expressed, that it allows for your own accountability, but it’s really so much more than that, so that was music to my spirit.” (And how many FitPoints had that run earned Ms. Winfrey? “I don’t count them, because it’s so ridiculous!” Ms. Winfrey said. “If I were to count them, probably it would be four, and it would be so irritating.”)

Weight Watchers has long had to fend off other programs like Nutrisystem, Medifast and Jenny Craig. But the new millennium has also brought competition in the form of free tracking apps like MyFitnessPal and LoseIt! “I keep doing the research and I realized that our greatest competition is people thinking they can get healthy themselves,” Ms. Grossman said.

Then there has been the rise of gleaming, “aspirational” alternatives like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and boutique fitness classes. “There’s a portion of wellness that seems for a small few,” Ms. Grossman said diplomatically, “and we think wellness should be part of everyone’s life and accessible to all.” (Weight Watchers’s membership costs range from about $3 per week for an online-only plan to $12 a week with personalized coaching.)

She has countered the industry’s largely middle-of-the-road rotation of celebrity endorsers like Marie Osmond (Nutrisystem) with the of-the-moment music producer DJ Khaled, who has embarked on a tour of various cities with a food truck. Fond of gardening, he has boasted of a 26-pound weight loss — though this week he came under fire for pouring vodka (only three SmartPoints, but still!) over his breakfast cereal.

Whether because of such moves, or the wind beneath her wings of Ms. Winfrey, Weight Watchers during a February earnings call announced a 23 percent increase in subscribers from the previous year and set a goal of $2 billion in revenue, up from the present $1.3 billion, by 2020.

“Mindy loves a challenge,” Mr. Banks said. “In any job that’s she ever had, she’s had a mind like a computer.”

Debating ‘SwishPoints’

In the hackathon’s deliberation chamber, Ms. Grossman did not seem as enthralled with SwishPoints as her fellow judges: “I just question — really, how much utilization is that really going to get? I don’t know if you’re the mom, and you do it — the big thing you want to do is now be swishing?”

The executives huddled in heated discussion for a few minutes, and then filed out so that Ms. Grossman could announce the results. Third prize went to a team that had figured out how to livestream Weight Watchers meetings to users who couldn’t show up in person. Second was G1’s menu scanner. First place was a tie between two of the teams.

“We believe there’s a big opportunity if The Incredibles and Swishpoints had a baby, seriously,” Ms. Grossman said with a broad smile, and thanked out-of-towners for making the trip.

“As much as we believe in technology,” she said, “having people together is also pretty fabulous.”

And it was time for a beer at the happy hour — two to six SmartPoints, depending.Two black men walked into a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia on Thursday afternoon and sat down. Officials said they had asked to use the restroom but because they had not bought anything, an employee refused the request. They were eventually asked to leave, and when they declined, an employee called the police.

Some of what happened next was recorded in a video that has been viewed more than eight million times on Twitter and was described by the chief executive of Starbucks as “very hard to watch.” Details of the episode, which the authorities provided on Saturday, ignited widespread criticism on social media, incited anger among public officials and prompted investigations.

The video shows the men surrounded by several police officers wearing bicycle helmets in the Center City Starbucks. When one officer asks another man whether he is “with these gentlemen,” the man said he was and called the episode ridiculous.

“What did they get called for?” asked the man, Andrew Yaffe, who is white, referring to the police. “Because there are two black guys sitting here meeting me?”“I think we always want to make sure that we can figure out ways to keep this the people’s building, and not make it too intrusive to get in to it,” he said.

There has been a trend toward tightening. Fewer than two dozen states had metal detectors at the public entrances of their capitols in 2008, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures; now the figure is more than 30. The North Carolina General Assembly is putting them in this month at its building in Raleigh. Officials there said they were meant “to make the building safe for all who have business with the General Assembly.”

Security experts say state capitols could be appealing targets, and that screening visitors is a must. But some public officials worry that metal detectors — and long lines to get through them — might deter people from visiting and demonstrating in halls of power that have always been accessible.

“I’m afraid it will make us appear less open,” said Darren G. Jackson, the Democratic leader of the North Carolina House of Representatives. “But I hope the day-to-day impact will be less.”

Officials in states that have used metal detectors for years say the inconvenience is usually minimal.

“It gives them a sense of security that they are protected, that we are here,” said Sgt. Michael Moore of the Capitol Police unit in Springfield, Ill., where detectors were put in after an unarmed statehouse guard was killed in 2004. “We rarely get any complaints.”

And states do not necessarily require everybody to pass through them. In Texas, people who are licensed to carry concealed weapons get to use a special lane to skip the screening that schoolchildren and sightseers get.

In Illinois, frequent visitors to the Capitol complex — including state employees, journalists and lobbyists — are issued badges that let them bypass the security line.

And the Colorado Senate approved a measure this year that would have allowed anyone with a felony-free record to pay $250, submit fingerprints and get an ID card to let them enter the Capitol without being searched.

That bill faltered in the House, but if it had become law, legislative staff members estimated that hundreds of lobbyists would have bought the cards, in a state where an armed man was shot and killed outside the governor’s office by state troopers in 2007.

For now, Utah doesn’t need any such exceptions. The Capitol in Salt Lake City may not have metal detectors, but in other ways it has the makings of a hilltop fortress: armed troopers in the driveway, bollards to keep vehicles away, a network of surveillance cameras, even an engineering system to guard against earthquake damage.

State officials say there have been occasional security episodes, including one when a man drove a pickup truck up the Capitol’s west steps (thus the bollards). And they say they have considered adding metal detectors, only to conclude that they are unnecessary and cloistering.

“Quite frankly, it’s the environment we live in in the state of Utah, and that it is the people’s house,” said Maj. Jess Anderson of the Utah Highway Patrol, who has been involved with Capitol security for more than a decade. “We certainly still want to keep the atmosphere inviting and warm to those that are visiting the Capitol building.”

Major Anderson said the Utah authorities are “not naïve” to threats, and seek “a fine balance" of security and openness.

Even so, at the granite and marble Capitol within sight of the snow-capped Wasatch Range, the absence of detectors that are so common elsewhere can be a bit bewildering for residents and visitors alike.

“It’s kind of surprising, truly, these days, because there are so many nuts,” Jill Forker, who lives just southeast of Salt Lake City, said as she left the Capitol.

“But it’s nice not to have to be able to go through them, and you can kind of just wander around,” said her husband, John, who works at a theater where customers’ backpacks are searched.

“But these are the state’s most important officials,” Ms. Forker continued, “and to not have a metal detector is kind of odd.”She does macro, too — she was joined onstage by approximately 100 dancers, singers and musicians, a stunning tableau that included fraternity pledges and drumlines and rows of female violinists in addition to the usual crackerjack backup dancers (which here included bone breakers and also dancers performing elaborate routines with cymbals).

Some superstars prize effortlessness, but Beyoncé shows her work — the cameras captured the force and determination in her dancing, and also her sweat. She performed for almost two hours, with only a few breaks, and her voice rarely flagged. Occasionally her set was punctuated with fireworks that, compared with what was happening onstage, seemed dull.

Beyoncé was originally meant to perform at Coachella last year, but rescheduled for this April after becoming pregnant; her Coachella performances this weekend and next are her only solo U.S. dates this year. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she said midset, then added an aside that was, in fact, the main point: “Ain’t that ’bout a bitch.”

Big-tent festivals, generally speaking, are blithe spaces — they don’t invite much scrutiny, because they can’t stand up to it. But Beyoncé’s simple recitation of fact was searing, especially on the same night that, in Cleveland, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame finally inducted Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, 15 and 45 years after their deaths, and also Bon Jovi, a band in which everyone is very much alive.

She was arguing not in defense of herself, but of her forebears. And her performance was as much ancestral tribute and cultural continuum — an uplifting of black womanhood — as contemporary concert. She sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the black national anthem, incorporated vocal snippets of Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and nodded at Ms. Simone’s “Strange Fruit.”

And she rendered her personal history as well. During the second half of the show, she unfurled a kind of This Is Your Life in reverse. First came her husband, Jay-Z, on “Déjà Vu” — with him, she was affectionate while easily outshining him. Then, a true surprise: a reunion with her former Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, during which she happily ceded the main spotlight. After that came a playful dance routine with her sister, Solange, on “Get Me Bodied.” (Sadly, there was no “Ring Off” with her mother, nor a rendition of “Daddy Lessons” with her father.)

As Beyoncé has gotten older, she’s been making music that’s increasingly visceral, both emotionally and historically. She is one of the only working pop stars who need not preoccupy herself with prevailing trends, or the work of her peers. She is an institution now, and that has allowed her freedom. “Lemonade” is her most accomplished album, and also a wild and risky one — thematically but also musically.

That may be one reason that last year, Beyoncé lost the Grammy for album of the year to Adele, the sort of upset that triggered a storm of criticism about the Grammys’ relevance, and, effectively, an almost-apology from Adele. In time, though, that moment will feel like a glitch. That space on the mantel will be filled by a National Medal of the Arts, or a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Like no other musician of her generation apart from Kanye West, Beyoncé is performing musicology in real time. It is bigger than any tribute she might receive. History is her stage.Friends said that after he left the organization, Mr. Buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels.

“Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather,” he wrote in the email sent to The Times. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”

In his note, which was received by The Times at 5:55 a.m., Mr. Buckel discussed the difficulty of improving the world even for those who make vigorous efforts to do so.

Privilege, he said, was derived from the suffering of others.

“Many who drive their own lives to help others often realize that they do not change what causes the need for their help,” Mr. Buckel wrote, adding that donating to organizations was not enough.

Noting that he was privileged with “good health to the final moment,” Mr. Buckel said he wanted his death to lead to increased action. “Honorable purpose in life invites honorable purpose in death,” he wrote.

The police said Mr. Buckel was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. in what they said was a suicide.

Susan Sommer, a former attorney for Lambda Legal who is now the general counsel for the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, said Mr. Buckel was “one of the architects of the freedom to marry and marriage equality movement.”

“He deserves tremendous thanks for recognizing this was in many ways at the heart of what it meant to be gay for many Americans and making it a priority,” she said. “I learned so much from him about the emotional center of what it means for a gay person not to be able to have all the protections for the person they love and that it’s worth fighting for.”

Lambda Legal credited Mr. Buckel for focusing the organization on the rights of lesbian, gay and transgender youth. One of the cases Mr. Buckel spearheaded, Nabozny v. Podlesny, was the first time a federal court ruled that schools have an obligation to prevent the bullying of gay students, said Camilla Taylor, acting legal director at Lambda Legal.

Mr. Buckel also guided Lambda Legal’s national work to allow gay people to marry. In another case he led, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples and their children were harmed because they were excluded from the rights granted via marriage. When Mr. Buckel suggested filing a lawsuit for gay marriage in Iowa in 2005, it was legal only in Massachusetts.

“It was considered a crazy thing to do because of the notion that Iowa would get to marriage equality before places like New York and New Jersey,” Ms. Taylor said.

Catherine Varous, a neighbor of Mr. Buckel’s, said he was very active in gardening, and together they worked on the Greenest Block in Brooklyn competition.

She said she often saw Mr. Buckel and his partner at the Park Slope Food Co-op and a farmer’s market. “He was the quieter of the two,” she said, referring to Mr. Buckel. “He was definitely more serious.”

Amy Orr, a kindergarten teacher who lives in the neighborhood, was out for her regular weekend jog at about 6:25 a.m. when she saw police officers standing over something that was smoldering.

She said she first “thought it was a pile of garbage because of the shopping cart” but then she saw the outline of a human body.

Runners and bicyclists continued to pass. But as more police officers and firefighters gathered, they all looked “dumbfounded,” Ms. Orr said. “Nobody could believe it.”

By 11 a.m., the authorities had removed Mr. Buckel’s body, leaving a blackened patch and a circular indentation around which parks officials placed two orange cones.

The grim scene stood in stark contrast to the rest of the park, which brimmed with activity. Several youth baseball games continued nearby and participants in PurpleStride, a walk dedicated to ending pancreatic cancer, strode along the bike path with runners and joggers.

The field where Mr. Buckel died would ordinarily be filled with activity, too. Warren Beishir, a graphic designer, said it was used for volleyball, soccer and barbecuing.

Mr. Beishir sat across from the field under a tree with his wife, Susan Stawicki, their 2-year-old daughter and their neighbors. They live across from the park and were awakened by sirens and flashing lights.

“How do you do that to yourself? It’s a terrible way to go, and I don’t want to think about it after today,” Mr. Beishir said.

“I hope they are at peace,” Ms. Stawicki said.She and Bram Gunther, a former chief of forestry, horticulture and natural resources for the Parks Department, founded the conservancy in 2012, when the city’s Million Trees NYC initiative was underway. That program began when Michael R. Bloomberg was mayor and was completed two years ago with a planting in the South Bronx. Scores of curbside tree pits got new occupants, but half of the million trees went into what the city describes as “forested natural areas.”

But, Ms. Charlop-Powers said, there was no long-term plan for managing the city’s forests or the less densely wooded areas in parks. The Million Trees project “didn’t focus beyond getting trees in the ground,” she said.

Enter the Natural Areas Conservancy, which began by conducting a survey. The group hired 25 scientists to take stock of biological conditions in parks. The conservancy’s senior ecologist, Helen Forgione, said the survey found 750 species of plants in the city’s forests.

The survey-takers also interviewed 1,600 park users. Their answers led to the conclusion that the urban forest has never been more important for people.

“Half the people reported recreating in New York City parkland, never leaving to go to the Catskills or Jones Beach,” Ms. Charlop-Powers said. “Their whole experience with nature is happening right here in the five boroughs, which means that if we want people not just to experience playgrounds and ball fields but to take a hike or be in a place where you can hear birds singing, it becomes really important to invest in forests.”

So, as with the subways, it’s about money.

The legislature in Albany approved $836 million for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s subway action plan after he declared a mass-transit state of emergency last year. For the forests, Ms. Charlop-Powers sees a smaller price tag and a longer timeline: $385 million over 25 years.

“Without investment, we risk losing wildlife and plants we may never be able to get back,” Ms. Charlop-Powers said.

The biological data indicated the city’s forests “are at a tipping point,” she said. The mature forests, which for the most part grew after the Civil War on land that earlier generations had logged and farmed, are “surprisingly healthy, similar to the conditions in rural forests upstate.”

The assumption had been that invasive vine species like Japanese honeysuckle and the mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata to those in the know) were crowding out the trees foresters prefer.

Invasive species were indeed found in 56 percent of the areas in the survey, but they were less prevalent in the older forests. It was the younger forests that troubled Ms. Charlop-Powers, especially in what foresters call the midstory and understory layers, the lower levels of the tree canopy. The researchers taking the survey found the smallest proportion of native species among the 561 species they counted in the understory.

The invaders include the Norway maple and the black locust. The latter, Ms. Forgione, the ecologist, said is rot-resistant, which is good, but raises nitrogen levels in the soil, which is not. “We don’t want high-nutrient soil,” she said. “Our mature forests have evolved on low-nutrient soil.” And the higher nitrogen levels figure in climate change.

Now, in close consultation with the Parks Department, the conservancy has prepared a long-term plan for the care of the city’s forests. The conservancy says it is the first plan of its kind in the nation. The conservancy is eager to export it to other cities and is training other nonprofits in the city to use data from the survey to their advantage.

The recommendations in the plan are for what Ms. Forgione calls “future forests,” but specifically future urban forests. She said that climate change could affect urban forests a generation or two before differences begin to appear in rural areas.

Already the conservancy’s ideas are shaping a chunk of forest in Prospect Park in Brooklyn. On a recent day, Susan M. Donoghue, the administrator and president of the Prospect Park Alliance, which manages the park, led the way to the area, on Lookout Hill. Longfellow’s “forest primeval” it was not. A helicopter whipped the air overhead, and a jet climbing away from Kennedy International Airport whined in the distance.

Last summer the alliance brought in four goats to do some weeding. Their mission was to clear out invasive species — but only on one side of the path. In the grayish light of early spring, it was the greener-looking side because it had English ivy, a nonnative species. Unlike, say, poison ivy, English ivy can take over the forest floor and crowd out trees. “Which means problems for the future forest,” Ms. Forgione said.

On the other side of the path, Ms. Forgione pointed to a sugar maple and an ash, trees that are considered desirable in the forest, although the ash is a species threatened by the Emerald ash borer, a beetle. “It’s a tree we would not recommend planting,” Ms. Forgione said. “In New York City, the days are numbered for our ash trees.”

But there are 10 trees on the conservancy’s list that will soon be planted on Lookout Hill, including three types of hickories with irresistible names — the pignut hickory, the shagbark hickory and the mockernut hickory.

“We’re thinking for the next century,” Ms. Forgione said. “That’s going to be our forest.”Brewers reliever Josh Hader easily shut the Mets down over the final two innings, striking out five of the six batters he faced.

But Harvey’s performance was far more alarming than the offense’s sputtering. He had offered cause for optimism in his first start this season — allowing just one hit over five shutout innings against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 3 — but showed signs of regression in his second outing, when he allowed four runs and nine hits over five innings against the Washington Nationals on April 8.

The Mets won both of those games, but in his third start on Saturday, Harvey virtually took them out of it by serving a fastball that Jonathan Villar sent just inside the left-field foul pole for a three-run homer in the second inning.

Two innings later, Jett Bandy, who had hit all of 15 home runs in his previous three major league seasons, rifled a 2-0 fastball into the left-field seats to give Milwaukee a 4-0 lead. The Brewers got their final run on a homer by Orlando Arcia off Hansel Robles in the ninth.

Harvey, who looked dominant in the first inning, hitting 95 miles per hour on the radar gun and needing just 11 pitches to get the first three outs, gradually lost the steam on his fastball. It was measured at 91 to 93 m.p.h. for the remainder of his outing.

Yet he stubbornly stuck to that pitch and his slider, which had been a lethal combination in the seasons before injuries robbed him of the lightning in his right arm.

“I think I got fastball- and slider-happy in the first couple of innings and put myself behind,” said Harvey, who fell to 0-1 with a 4.80 earned run average.

But Manager Mickey Callaway saw the problem as Harvey’s not trusting his secondary pitches, his changeup and curveball, enough to keep the Brewers off balance.

“I just didn’t quite see the confidence that I had seen in him before,” Callaway said. “Tonight I didn’t see him attack as well as I’d seen him throughout spring training and the first couple of starts. I think everybody has to use all their pitches to kind of offset guys at times. You have to show the other ones at least, even if you don’t have a great feel for them.”

Paul Sewald replaced Harvey and was effective, pitching three hitless innings and striking out five. But once again, the Mets needed four innings out of their bullpen, underscoring another early-season concern for Callaway.

Relief work from Robert Gsellman and Seth Lugo, former starters who have no trouble throwing multiple innings, has eased the burden somewhat. But Callaway pointed out before the game, “Historically, if you lead the league in bullpen innings, you’re going to lose about 96 games.”

Considering the Mets’ hot start, that seems highly unlikely.

“It’s Game 13, you know?” outfielder Jay Bruce said. “We’ve got a lot of games left, and I look forward to those.”Photo

MANCHESTER, England — Pep Guardiola spent the day golfing. Raheem Sterling was relaxing on his sofa. Vincent Kompany, trailed by the cameras of Manchester City’s in-house television station, was with his family. In the end, none of them needed to do anything for Manchester City to be crowned Premier League champion.

Guardiola and his team had hoped, of course, to win a third championship in seven years in rather more satisfying circumstances: had Guardiola and City beaten Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium last Saturday, they would have claimed the title on home soil, against their fiercest rival. Despite leading by two goals at halftime, though, City collapsed, losing by 3-2.

Guardiola was phlegmatic in defeat: all City had to do, he said, was win two of its remaining six games.

In the end, one was enough. After 10 days in which City had crashed out of the Champions League quarterfinals to Liverpool and lost the Manchester derby, Guardiola’s team swept Tottenham Hotspur aside on Saturday night, winning by 3-1 at Wembley. On Sunday morning, its lead at the top of the Premier League was 16 points.

United, its nearest contender, had been expected to cut that back to 13 — with five games to play — on Sunday. José Mourinho’s United was at home to West Bromwich Albion, rooted to the foot of the table, all but assured of relegation, and coming to the end of a season in which it has fired two managers, a chairman, a chief executive and a director of football.

Even Kompany was not expecting much at Old Trafford. On Sunday morning, he asked his Twitter followers which games they would be watching on a busy day around Europe. He name-checked eight games — Milan against Napoli, Schalke against Borussia Dortmund, Celtic against Rangers, P.S.V. Eindhoven against Ajax — but not the one that could decide the title.Tensions, too, were rising a few blocks away, inside the rehearsal hall at the Jewish Community Center. Rex Harrison, the show’s Henry Higgins and marquee star, was looking increasingly nervous, as the 20-year-old Julie Andrews, who was to play Eliza Doolittle, was keeping her cool. In an era before microphones could supersize voices, actors had only their own vocal cords to project to the back of the theater, and Harrison — a novice to the Broadway musical, though he had sung in London shows decades before — was feeling insecure.

Photo

The show’s director, Moss Hart; its librettist and lyricist, Alan Jay Lerner; and its composer, Frederick Loewe, tried to reassure the temperamental actor, but when he faced an orchestra of 32 musicians in the 1,600-seat, two-balconied theater in a final rehearsal for that first public performance, he became overwhelmed

According to Lerner’s 1978 memoir, when Harrison got to the “A Hymn to Him” number, he stopped the rehearsal.

“Mossie! Mossie!,” he cried out to the director in the darkened orchestra, stepping into the footlights. “We’re not going to open tonight — and I may never open.”

Among the backstage witnesses to that piece of theater history: Jerry Adler, now 87, who was an assistant stage manager. “He flung his hat into the orchestra and stormed off to his dressing room, slamming the door behind him,” Mr. Adler recalled recently.

“He was terrified,” added Mr. Adler, now best known as a late-in-life actor (“The Good Wife,” “The Sopranos”). “We were opening that night and we hadn’t been through the second act yet.”

Photo

As Mr. Adler remembers it, Harrison’s British valet emerged from his dressing room to make a formal announcement: “Mr. Harrison would like to see Mr. Hart.”

Mr. Adler went on: “The rest of us were all standing around, like, what do we do now? So we did a little rehearsal of the next scene, which was ‘A Little Bit of Luck’ with Stanley Holloway.

“Everything was fine and great with that number,” he added. “Finally, Moss came out and told us to release the cast for the day.”

The creative team scurried in and out of Harrison’s dressing room to urge the star to change his mind.

Finally, an emergency telephone call was placed to Maurice H. Bailey, who ran the Shubert and was playing bridge at the local country club, according to Edith Goodmaster, his executive secretary at the time.

Mr. Bailey rushed to the theater, remembered Ms. Goodmaster, 87, and told Harrison that if he didn’t perform that night, Mr. Bailey would go onstage and tell the audience of the actor’s refusal.

Harrison’s manager “turned white,” Ms. Goodmaster said, adding: “Mr. Bailey later told me that he would never have gone through with the threat. He was bluffing.”

It’s not clear whether Mr. Bailey’s warning — or the failure-to-perform lawsuits that were then being discussed with Harrison’s lawyer and agent — had an impact, but the actor relented, appeased by the promise that Hart would advise the theatergoers of the production’s tenuous state before the curtain rose.

“Moss told Rex that we would explain to them that there are technical problems, and that it’s more like a rehearsal,” Mr. Adler said. “He said, ‘They won’t mind at all, because audiences love things like that.’”

Photo

Around 6 o’clock, Hart came out of Harrison’s dressing room. “I’ll never forget what he said,” Mr. Adler recalled. “He said, grandly: ‘Gather the players! We’re opening tonight!’”

Word of the performance’s cancellation, which had been broadcast on the radio, was rescinded, and crowds started forming at the theater: Yale students, local fans and trainloads of theater folk from Manhattan.

Meanwhile, Mr. Adler and another assistant stage manager crisscrossed New Haven, rounding up the actors from Kaysey’s (a theater hangout) and the nearby Taft Hotel, where most of the cast was housed.

“I went across the street to the Loew’s Poli,” said Mr. Adler, referring to the movie theater opposite the Shubert, “and in the middle of the movie, I yelled out: ‘Anyone here from ‘My Fair Lady’ cast? The show is back on tonight!’ We got everyone but one — Rosemary Gaines, who had an attack of appendicitis and was in the hospital.” (She was an ensemble member who played a servant.)

As promised, Hart stepped before the curtain around 8:45 p.m. — openings were later in that era — and addressed the audience with his famous elegant charm.

“It was one of the great opening night speeches,” said Mr. Adler, who watched from the wings. “He finished by quoting Blanche DuBois: ‘We have always depended on the kindness of strangers.’ The audience loved it.”

The orchestra started its overture as lights on the scrim revealed a tableau at Covent Garden. The first scene began with Harrison’s revealing himself from behind a pillar. He was holding a notebook. “I could see that he was shaking,” Mr. Adler said.

The welcoming applause helped calm him, and he got through his opening number: “Why Can’t the English?”

“That gave him confidence,” Mr. Adler said. “Wouldn’t It Be Loverly,” which showcased Ms. Andrews’s soprano, was welcomed even more warmly. By the time the old music hall pro Holloway performed “With a Little Bit of Luck,” it was clear that the audience was loving the show.

But the night’s high point, according to those who were there, was at the end of “The Rain in Spain,” when Ms. Andrews, Harrison and Robert Coote — who played Colonel Pickering — joyously collapsed on a sofa after Eliza’s linguistic breakthrough.

“The audience just went berserk, leapt to their feet and refused to stop applauding,” Mr. Adler said.

Harrison and Coote didn’t know what to do.

“It was little Julie — a veteran of England’s music halls — who took command,” Mr. Adler said. “She grabbed their hands and led them in taking a small bow, acknowledging the audience’s applause so they could go on with the show. It never happened quite like that again.”

At intermission, Ms. Goodmaster remembered, members of the audience were rushing to the box office to snap up remaining tickets for the run.

That’s not to say the show was perfect. With technical delays and an overstuffed score, “My Fair Lady” ran past midnight. Three numbers were later cut. And the problematic turntables proved problematic throughout.

“They never worked perfectly,” Mr. Adler said. “Not even on opening night in New York.”Like other abstract artists, she did not discuss the meanings, if any, in her works. She insisted that she thought only about the shapes, the space and the colors.

“People like to understand, and I wish they wouldn’t,” she told The Financial Times in 2015. “I wish they’d just look. It’s visual.”

Gillian Ayres was born in London on Feb. 3, 1930. Her father was a part-owner of a hat factory whose customers included the British Army. Her mother, the former Florence Brown, was a homemaker. For a while, she attended school in an air-raid shelter in London.

When she was attending a girls’ school in 1943, books on van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne and Monet inspired her to paint. And at 16, she insisted on attending art school and was admitted to what is now called the Camberwell College of Arts in London.

Chafing at the rigidity of the teaching, she left shortly before taking the final exam. She got a job as a hotel chambermaid in Paris, then returned to London to work in an art gallery with Henry Mundy, a painter she had met at Camberwell. They married in 1951 and divorced 25 years later.

By the mid-1950s, Ms. Ayres was a rising abstract painter, splattering paint on a canvas on the floor like Jackson Pollock.

“The whole idea of the canvas as an area in which to act, an area and what one does with it — I wanted to find out about that, obsessively,” she told The Telegraph in 2010.

Ms. Ayres came of age in Britain with abstract artists like Howard Hodgkin and Victor Pasmore. Roger Hilton, an older artist she admired, wrote a note to her in the early 1950s that she often referred to in the ensuing decades, she told The Independent in 1995. It described the abstract painter’s journey into the unknown, armed only with colors, shapes and space-creating powers.

“Can he construct with these means,” the note said, “a barque capable of carrying not only himself to some further shore but, with the aid of others, a whole flotilla, which may be seen eventually as having been carrying humanity forward?”

Ms. Ayres made her journey into abstract art in Britain as a woman among far more men.

“Nobody else was doing anything as adventurous or uninhibited, like throwing paint at the canvas, which only had parallels in America,” Alan Cristea, whose London gallery represents Ms. Ayres, said in a telephone interview. “But she refused to be classified as a woman artist; she thought that was silly.”

Yet, he added, “She became sort of a role model for women of the younger generation.”

Her work has been widely exhibited in Europe, and when she had a show in Manhattan, at the Knoedler Gallery, in 1985, the New York Times critic John Russell praised her as a “full-bodied, adventurous and uncompromising painter.”

Photo

He later wrote, “Pushing the medium to its limits, she communicates a kind of reckless radiance that comes across in paintings large and small, square or round.”

Mr. Ayres taught at St. Martin’s School of Art in London and the Winchester School of Art in Hampshire, where she was the head of painting.

Mark Hudson, an art critic for The Telegraph and a former student of hers, recalled in an article on Friday how influential Ms. Ayres had been.

“Within months of her arrival,” he wrote, “a substantial number had stopped painting aimless landscapes and started producing large-scale, gestural, Ayresesque abstracts — a development that had more to do with Ayres’s force of personality than any kind of systematic instruction.”

In addition to her son Sam, Ms. Ayres is survived by another son, Jim Mundy, and a granddaughter. She continued to live with her former husband for most of the years after their divorce.

Ms. Ayres stopped painting about a year ago because of illness.

“I always knew in my heart of hearts that the day she couldn’t paint, she wouldn’t live very long,” Sam Mundy, also an abstract artist, said in a telephone interview. “I’m surprised she lasted a year not painting.”Photo

From the opening sentences of the opening story in Nafissa Thompson-Spires’s debut collection, “Heads of the Colored People,” we’re in a world of humor, provocation and deep reflection about cultural signifiers: “Riley wore blue contact lenses and bleached his hair — which he worked with gel and a blow-dryer and a flatiron some mornings into Sonic the Hedgehog spikes so stiff you could prick your finger on them, and sometimes into a wispy side-swooped bob with long bangs — and he was black. But this wasn’t any kind of self-hatred thing.” Ms. Thompson-Spires was inspired by James McCune Smith, a 19th-century abolitionist and doctor whose brief stories about various characters were published under the title “Heads of the Colored People, Done With a Whitewash Brush.” In an author’s note, Ms. Thompson-Spires writes that, like the work of Smith and some of his contemporaries, including William J. Wilson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, her stories are interested in “black U.S. citizenship, the black middle class and the future of black American life during pivotal sociopolitical moments.” Below, she discusses her surprise at the tone that has developed in her work, the way she was inspired by stand-up comedians in the 1990s and more.

When did you first get the idea to write this book?

There was a line that kept coming to my head: “wore blue contact lenses and bleached his hair.” I kept trying to flesh out that character. Once I realized that I wanted to be in conversation with James McCune Smith, I realized the theme that could tie together the collection, and I wrote to the theme. I wanted to update McCune Smith’s sketches, but that became too restrictive, so I ended up thinking about heads in general: phrenology, psychology, mental illness, leadership, there’s a literal head injury in one of the stories.

This was the very end of 2015. I was writing stories that were potentially going to be sent out as individual submissions, but never thought I’d write a collection. My M.F.A. thesis was a novel. I wrote maybe five or six new stories once I realized I wanted to write a collection.

What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?

My sense of humor is a lot darker then I thought it was. I like to see myself as a goofy but pleasant-ish person with a melancholy tinge. But some of the stories are really dark. There’s police brutality, infanticide, weird stuff with fetishization of a disabled man. I kind of surprised myself that that was in me.Click on the slide show to see this week’s featured properties in New York City:

• In Morningside Heights, a two-bedroom, two-bath prewar apartment with a decorative fireplace with a carved mantel in the living room, marble counters and stainless-steel appliances in the kitchen, a home office and a washer and dryer.

• In Brooklyn Heights, a two-bedroom, one-bath, ground floor co-op in a 10-unit, prewar, pet-friendly building with a dining room, modern kitchen, updated bath, a washer and dryer and a communal roof deck with Harbor views.

• In the West Village, a two-bedroom, one-bath prewar co-op with dark-stained floors, tall ceilings, marble counters, an exposed-brick wall, seven windows and three exposures, in a non-doorman building.The interview with Mr. Comey and the weekslong media blitz he plans for his book amount to a remarkable public assault on a sitting president by someone who served at the highest levels of power in the government.

The stakes for both men could hardly be higher. Mr. Comey seems likely to be the star witness in any obstruction of justice case brought against the president by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the sprawling Russia investigation. Mr. Trump’s legal fate, as well as his political fortunes in Washington, may depend on whether he succeeds in undermining the credibility of Mr. Comey and the law enforcement institutions he views as arrayed against him.

The ABC interview is Mr. Comey’s first major attempt to prevent that from happening, and in it he speaks with the abandon of a man who finally feels unleashed. But Mr. Comey’s liberation is all the more combustible because it is aimed directly at a president who has said with pride on Twitter that “when someone attacks me, I always attack back...except 100x more.”

As if on cue, hours before the interview aired, Mr. Trump called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” for the second time in three days, saying in a pair of early-morning tweets that he belongs in jail for what the president said were lies to Congress and leaks of classified information. In another tweet, Mr. Trump said Mr. Comey would go down in history as “the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!”

Mr. Comey responded later in the day with a more subtle dig of his own.

“My book is about ethical leadership & draws on stories from my life & lessons I learned from others,” he tweeted. “3 presidents are in my book: 2 help illustrate the values at the heart of ethical leadership; 1 serves as a counterpoint.”

It is unclear where the epic battle of wills will lead, other than to a sustained escalation of insults between two men who have each admitted to having outsize egos. But it is certain to be a test of powerful forces in the modern media landscape: the presidential megaphone, amplified by 50 million Twitter followers, and the global reach of an adversary on a seemingly endless, 24-hour, cable-news-driven book tour.

Parts of the interview that have already been aired suggest that Mr. Comey talks in detail about the interactions he had with Mr. Trump, including meetings and phone calls about which he says he meticulously wrote down notes afterward for posterity. (In another tweet on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Comey’s “‘memos’ are self serving and FAKE!”)

Some of the most startling assertions by Mr. Comey about Mr. Trump in the interview revolve around his first meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower just days before the inauguration. That day, intelligence officials, including Mr. Comey, briefed the incoming president on Russia’s attempt to meddle with the election.

Mr. Comey says in the interview that Mr. Trump and his aides seemed interested only in what the former F.B.I. director called the “P.R. and spin” about the issue.

“The conversation, to my surprise, moved into a P.R. conversation about how the Trump team would position this and what they could say about this,” Mr. Comey said in a preview of the interview that aired on Sunday morning. “No one, to my recollection, asked: ‘So what’s coming next from the Russians? How might we stop it? What’s the future look like?’”

“It was all, ‘What can we say about what they did and how it affects the election that we just had?’” Mr. Comey said.

It was at the end of the meeting that Mr. Comey says in his book that he asked to speak to Mr. Trump alone to brief him on the salacious “Steele dossier,” which contains unverified allegations about Mr. Trump, including a claim that the Russian government has video recordings of him watching prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013.

Mr. Comey says in the ABC News interview that Mr. Trump denied the allegations that day, saying, “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” Weeks later, in a telephone call from the president after the dossier was published by BuzzFeed, Mr. Trump again denied the account in graphic terms, Mr. Comey said.

“There’s no way I would let people pee on each other around me,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Comey’s account in his book. Mr. Comey said the president also raised the idea that the F.B.I. should investigate the claim as a way of proving that it never happened. Mr. Comey said he warned Mr. Trump that doing so would add to “the narrative” that the president was under investigation.

Mr. Comey said in the interview that it was an “out of body” experience to be talking with the incoming president about whether the incident had taken place, or whether the Russians had material they could use to blackmail Mr. Trump.

“I was floating above myself looking down saying you’re sitting here briefing the incoming president of the United States about prostitutes in Moscow,” Mr. Comey says in the interview. Asked whether he believed Mr. Trump’s denials, Mr. Comey said he was not sure.

“I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013,” he said. “It’s possible, but I don’t know.”

The president took a break from his attacks on Mr. Comey as he left the White House on a rainy Sunday afternoon to spend time at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. But it seems likely that he and his allies will not back down in the face of Mr. Comey’s barrage of public accusations, which are expected to continue for weeks.

On ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, unloaded on Mr. Comey, calling him a “self-admitted leaker” and a liar.

For his part, Mr. Comey appears unrelenting as well.

In the book, he compares Mr. Trump’s demands for his loyalty to the induction ceremonies favored by Sammy the Bull, the boss of the Cosa Nostra. Holding little back, Mr. Comey argues that Americans in both parties should be wary of the damage Mr. Trump is doing to the country.

“What is happening now is not normal,” he writes. “It is not fake news. It is not O.K.”Photo

For the second time in a week, President Trump on Sunday excoriated the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey in a series of tweets after details from Mr. Comey’s tell-all book were leaked before its official release.

In the latest tirade, which unfolded over an hour, the president declared that Mr. Comey “will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” He mentioned Mr. Comey’s contemporaneous notes of their meetings, calling those memos self-serving and “fake.”

He again called Mr. Comey a “slimeball,” an insult he lobbed on Friday. He also questioned Mr. Comey’s intelligence twice — first by saying the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails had been handled “stupidly” and then, about 30 minutes later, that Mr. Comey “is not smart!”

Hours later, Mr. Comey appeared to make an indirect response to the jabs. In a post on on Twitter, he said his book, “A Higher Loyalty,” was about “ethical leadership” and drew not only from his own life but also from “lessons I learned from others.”

Of the three presidents mentioned in the book, two help illustrate “the values at the heart of ethical leadership,” Mr. Comey said, and one “serves as a counterpoint.”

In his tirade, Mr. Trump questioned the integrity of former United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who said in a recent interview with NBC News that she did not discuss Hillary Clinton during her meeting with President Bill Clinton in June 2016 on a plane on an airport tarmac. Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email server has long been the subject of controversy and that meeting with Mr. Clinton cast a shadow over the federal investigation.Photo

When President Trump fired James B. Comey as the director of the F.B.I. last May, that did not mean the end of Mr. Comey’s time in the public eye — far from it. His memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” is about to be released and Mr. Comey is featured in a wide-ranging interview with ABC News that is set to air on Sunday at 10 p.m. Eastern.

For days, Mr. Trump has waged a ferocious counterattack against Mr. Comey, who portrays the president in his book as an unethical and dishonest leader. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump unleashed a barrage of Twitter posts, calling Mr. Comey a liar and denying he had asked him for loyalty.

Mr. Trump suggested Mr. Comey should be jailed, accusing him of leaking classified information and lying to Congress. He referred to the Clinton email investigation, saying Mr. Comey “was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job.” He also called Mr. Comey a “slimeball” again, and said he had thrown the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, “under the bus.”

Here is an overview of The New York Times’s coverage of Mr. Comey, who earned a reputation for being fastidiously nonpartisan yet has found himself, repeatedly, at the center of some of Washington’s fiercest political storms.

A letter to Congress, weeks before the election

Mr. Comey made a fateful decision in October 2016, when he was the F.B.I. director. In a letter that was immediately made public (you can read it here), he told Congress the agency was reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails.

It was not standard protocol for the F.B.I. to make these kinds of announcements publicly. But Mr. Comey determined that this time was different, in part because he believed that failing to disclose the investigation could tarnish both the F.B.I. and the presidential election.

Here is a deep dive into the back story of that decision, which may have contributed to Mr. Trump’s upset victory.Beyond the immediate question of whether the new strikes actually accomplished the stated goal of diminishing Syria’s capacity to make and use chemical agents, the attack posed the risk of drawing the United States more deeply into a conflict in which Russia and Iran have more invested than ever in keeping Mr. Assad in power.

The United States is “locked and loaded” to strike again if Mr. Assad is believed to renew his use of chemical weapons, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council on Saturday at an emergency meeting called by Russia.

“We are confident that we have crippled Syria’s chemical weapons program. We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will,” Ms. Haley said.

She said that Russia had failed to abide by a 2013 promise to ensure that Syria got rid of its chemical weapons stockpiles.

“While Russia was busy protecting the regime, Assad took notice,” she said. “The regime knew that it could act with impunity, and it did.”

The Pentagon provided no immediate evidence that the sites that were struck were producing substances covered by the 2013 agreement between Russia and the United States to eliminate Syria’s chemical arms.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday that the American government was confident that Syrian forces had used chlorine in the deadly attack on civilians last Saturday in Douma, but did not provide evidence.

The White House has cited photographs and videos from Douma to make the case, and has dismissed alternative explanations from the Syrian and Russian governments. It said that the nerve agent sarin may have been used in addition to chlorine.

Chlorine, as a commercially available substance, was not included in the 2013 agreement. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined as part of the 2013 deal, prohibits the use of any chemical as a weapon.

The American-led strikes on Syria jolted residents of Damascus, the capital, from their beds as their walls and windows shook. American officials said the offensive was to punish Syria for the Douma attack, which left scores dead.

A group from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which had announced a fact-finding mission to determine if chemical weapons were used in the Douma attack, arrived in Damascus on Saturday morning, the group said in a statement.

A statement by the Syrian military said 110 missiles had been fired in the American-led strike. Three people were injured in Homs, it said. Videos from Damascus showed Syrian air defense missiles launching into a dark night sky, and the Russian military said that at one Syrian air base, all 12 cruise missiles that targeted the site had been shot down.

Defense Department officials batted down those claims, saying that the entire American-led operation was over and the targets were destroyed before Syria launched any of the 40 missiles it fired into the air.

“Taken together, these attacks were able to overwhelm the Syrian air defense system,” Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, the Pentagon’s Joint Staff director, said at a news conference. “None of our aircraft involved were successfully engaged by Syrian defense forces.”

He added that the barrage of missiles had hit their targets within a couple of minutes at most. He said that all three targets had been destroyed, and that all warplanes had returned safely to base.

But the strikes were limited, with an eye toward making sure they did not draw retaliation from Russia and Iran and set off a wider conflict. For that reason, Mr. Assad may still be able to use chemical agents in the future.

“I would say there’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” General McKenzie said. “I’m not going to say that they’re going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future. I suspect, however, they’ll think long and hard about it.”

In a statement, the British government said that Prime Minister Theresa May, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Mr. Trump had agreed in separate phone calls that the military strikes had been a success, “sending a clear message that the use of chemical weapons can never become normalized.”

But the limited nature of the strikes left some members of Congress and other observers underwhelmed.

“I fear that when the dust settles, this strike will be seen as a weak military response and Assad will have paid a small price for using chemical weapons yet again,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Assad has likely calculated a limited American strike is just the cost of doing business.”

Randa Slim, an analyst at the Middle East Institute, tweeted: “If this is it, Assad should be relieved.”

Sure enough, early Saturday morning, Mr. Assad’s office posted a video that appeared to show him strolling into work in a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase as if nothing had happened.

Condemnation of the strikes from Syria’s allies was swift.

“The United States and its allies continue to demonstrate blatant disregard for international law,” said the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily A. Nebenzya, on Saturday. “It’s time for Washington to learn that the international code of behavior regarding the use of force is regulated by the United Nations Charter,” he added.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, called the strikes “a crime” and the leaders of the United States, France and Britain “criminals.”

“But they will not benefit from this attack, just as they committed similar crimes over the past years during their presence in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and did not benefit from them,” he said.

There were no signs of immediate retaliation, suggesting that Mr. Assad and his allies planned to weather the storm, perhaps in the belief that the United States was mostly concerned with avoiding deeper involvement.

“If I were Assad, I would be thinking, ‘Let them get it out of their system. Things are still trending in the right direction today,’ ” said Faysal Itani, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “Nothing that Trump said on television really touched on the Syrian conflict.”

In announcing the strikes Friday night, Mr. Trump suggested that more American action could be on the way. “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,” Mr. Trump said. Other officials, however, said the United States and its allies were done for now.

Saturday’s strikes were more extensive than those Mr. Trump launched in the wake of another reported chemical attack last year, involving nearly double the number of missiles. But much has changed in Syria in the meantime to make Mr. Assad and his allies more secure.

The rebels who once threatened his control have been routed from all of Syria’s major cities, and even from smaller strongholds like Douma, the last town they held near Damascus, which they surrendered after the reported chemical attack last weekend.

Meanwhile, the war has further shattered Syria, and international powers including the United States, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Iran — along with militant groups including Hezbollah — have intervened to fight for their interests.

Iran and Russia have expanded their military reach. Russia has a presence on most Syrian military bases, and its air force has been essential to Mr. Assad’s recent advances. Iran has used the chaos of war to strengthen its proxies to deter and possibly confront Israel.

The United States still has about 2,000 troops in eastern Syria working with a Kurdish-led militia to fight the jihadists of the Islamic State. But with the militants now nearly defeated, American officials have started thinking about when to withdraw. Before the suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma, Mr. Trump had said he wanted to bring them home soon.

While the United States called for Mr. Assad to leave power early in the conflict and gave cash and arms to the rebels who sought to overthrow him, it has more recently resigned itself to his remaining in power. That was partly because it feared the vacuum that could emerge if Mr. Assad’s government collapsed, and partly because it was clear that Russia and Iran were willing to invest more in winning than the United States was.

So Saturday’s strikes remained focused on punishing him for using chemical weapons. Last year’s strikes had the same goal, but only succeeded for a limited time.

“Military interventions have a shelf life,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who studies Syria. “For a certain time, it prevented them from using chemical weapons, but after a while it dissipated. So we’ll have to wait to see how this attack is different.”

Mr. Trump made it clear when announcing the strikes that he does not consider it the job of the United States to fix problems in the Middle East.

“No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East,” he said. “It’s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place.”

He did, however, speak of working closely with American allies in the region such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar to ensure that Iran did not capitalize on the defeat of the Islamic State.

Still, such an international coalition would be starting years behind what Russia and Iran have already done, and some of the Arab allies Mr. Trump mentioned are not even speaking to each other. Mr. Trump has so far shown little penchant for the kind of strategic alliance-building it would take to change the direction of the war.

Some Syrians, however, took solace in the sight of smoke rising from Mr. Assad’s military bases.

“For many Syrians, the fact that their butcher was punished is incredibly cathartic,” Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, which opposes the government, wrote on Twitter. “But war continues.”Photo

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to impose new sanctions against Russia on Monday to punish it for enabling the Syrian government’s use of chemical weapons in its civil war, the latest in a series of actions by both sides underscoring the deterioration in relations between Moscow and the West.

The sanctions, coming shortly after American-led airstrikes against facilities linked to Syria’s chemical weapons, are meant to signal that the United States holds responsible not just the Damascus government of President Bashar al-Assad but also his patrons in Russia and Iran. President Trump has vowed that Syria’s allies will pay a “big price” for permitting his use of poison gas.

The sanctions were announced on Sunday by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations and the administration’s leading public voice excoriating Russia in recent days. “They will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use,” she said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message and our hope is that they listen to it.”

Mr. Trump has tried through most of his presidency to forge a friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and avoid criticizing him personally even as a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, investigated whether his campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 election. But in recent weeks, Mr. Trump’s administration has taken increasing action against Russia, and the president singled out Mr. Putin over Syria’s use of chemical weapons on Twitter and again in a televised speech on Friday night.

New sanctions on Monday would be the third round enacted by the Trump administration against Russia in the past four weeks. Last month the administration targeted Russian companies and individuals for intervening in the 2016 election and mounting cyberattacks against Western facilities. It followed that this month with penalties against Mr. Putin’s inner circle, singling out some of Russia’s richest men and top government officials.

The administration also expelled 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers and closed the Russian Consulate in Seattle in response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain.So far, officials say, two factors make them wonder whether the facilities were still central to Syria’s program. At this point, there are no known casualties at the sites, which suggests that either no one was there during the evening, or they had been previously abandoned. And there are no reports of chemical agent leakage from the sites, despite attacks by more than 100 sea- and air-launched missiles.

Whether those particular sites were still in use or not, the conflict in Syria has demonstrated a larger truth: While it is easy to blow up Mr. Assad’s chemical facilities, it is also relatively simple for him to reconstitute them elsewhere, or just turn to a commercially available substance like chlorine to make a crude poison that any nation is allowed to possess.

That may explain why General McKenzie was a little more circumspect than his predecessors in forecasting the long-range effectiveness of the latest strikes.

“I would say there’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” he told reporters at the Pentagon on Saturday.

“I believe that we took the heart of it out with the attacks that we accomplished last night,” he continued. But he added that “I’m not going to say that they are going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future.” Instead, he said, he believed that “they’ll think long and hard about it.”

His comment seemed to reflect a central fact: Mr. Assad has learned a lot about how to hide his stockpiles from inspectors. One of the failings of the accord between Russia and the United States that was supposed to rid Syria of chemical arms in 2014 was that it was based on Syria’s “declared” stockpiles, a nuance Mr. Kerry took care to note. There was never confidence that the Russians had succeeded in removing as many weapons stores as they claimed, or in destroying production facilities.

One of the sites struck on Saturday, the Barzeh research and development center, has long been known to American intelligence officials and to international inspectors, according to a senior intelligence official.

Administration officials briefing reporters Saturday afternoon said that equipment at that site and two others — the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility and a nearby “bunker facility” — was destroyed, setting back Mr. Assad’s program by months or years. But they were careful not to claim that the facilities were actively in use at the time of the attack.

“In relation to the Barzeh target, yes, we assessed that there were probably some chemical and nerve agents in that target,” General McKenzie said. Those, however, could have been residual, or long abandoned.

Sophisticated facilities are not needed to produce chlorine, the agent that Syrian forces are suspected to have used a week ago to kill dozens of civilians, including children. It is commercially available, used for water systems. And the nerve agent sarin, which the White House has said may also have been used a week ago, can be produced just about anywhere, as a French intelligence report released on Saturday noted.

The report concludes that “the Syrian military retains expertise from its traditional chemical weapons agent program to both use sarin and produce and deploy chlorine munitions.” The United States, it noted, “also assesses the regime still has chemicals — specifically sarin and chlorine — that it can use in future attacks.”

That is a stark difference from the declarations made in June 2014, when the joint mission between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons trumpeted that Syria or other parties had destroyed, with the exception of a dozen facilities, all “declared production, mixing and filling equipment and munitions, as well as many buildings associated with its declared chemical weapons program.”

Chlorine presents a particular challenge for governments and organizations seeking to control chemical weapons. It is both very lethal and very necessary, and legal to possess in all nations, said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Mr. Knights, who studied the use of chlorine as a weapon by Al Qaeda in Iraq a decade ago, said that the militants used to pair it with explosives, which would burn it off. Using it the way Mr. Assad’s forces have — essentially dropping it in concentrated form in a barrel — can lead to far more casualties.

“The most dangerous prospect was that someone would use chlorine in the way that the Syrian regime has done and disperse it in a whole community,” he said. “It is a dangerous element, and you cannot remove it from any environment in the Middle East,” given its importance in water purification.

As a result, chemical weapons treaties do not bar its possession. But the Chemical Weapons Convention, which went into force in 1997 and which Syria joined, under pressure, in 2013, does bar deliberately using it as a poison gas.

Nations have been finding loopholes in such international agreements — or ignoring them entirely — since the first failed efforts to bar such weaponry more than a century ago. Mr. Assad has clearly calculated that turning a widely available chemical into a weapon to clear out neighborhoods and create terror is a potent option.

“For me, the big story is chlorine; it’s not sarin,” Mr. Knights said. “The regime has been good at using a chemical weapon that has enormous availability and is produced in completely legal, dual-use facilities and vital to the running of any country.”

“Intent is the problem when you’ve got a regime that loves using this stuff,” he added. “You either have to deter the regime from using it by imposing significant costs, or you have to get rid of the regime. But there is no way you can get rid of the capability.”

No international investigative body has yet determined what chemicals were used in the attack last Saturday in Douma, near Damascus. The American intelligence assessments suggest that while chlorine was the primary chemical, “some additional information points to the regime also using” sarin, which is more dangerous and harder to handle.

Videos taken in the aftermath of the attack show large yellow canisters that experts have said appear to be chlorine tanks, of the kind often used for civilian purposes.

Some videos show one canister that appears to have either broken through a wall or flown through a hole in it and landed on a bed without exploding.

Another video shows a similar canister that appears to have knocked a hole in the concrete roof of an apartment building.

Syrian activists who visited the site, as well as a report by Bellingcat, a group that conducts investigations with open-source data, said that the canister had fallen on the roof of a building where dozens of people had been sheltering on the lower floors.

The available evidence suggests that whatever substance was in the canister was released after it landed and wafted down the stairs, killing those on the floors below.

Subsequent videos show dozens of men, women and children lying lifeless on the ground with foam coming from their mouths and nostrils and what appear to be burned corneas. Both symptoms can be caused by chlorine.

In a series of tweets after studying the attack, Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, said that the canister appeared to have been dropped toward no specific target, and had just happened to land on a densely packed building.

Had the canister fallen elsewhere, Mr. Higgins wrote, “we’d see a fraction of deaths, and you probably wouldn’t have even heard about it happening.”

“It was really just thanks to the catastrophic success of the chlorine attack that anyone even cared, not anything that Assad could have planned for,” Mr. Higgins wrote.Just like that, she had stumbled into a growing industry that makes money by coaxing women into having surgery — sometimes unnecessarily — so that they are more lucrative plaintiffs in lawsuits against medical device manufacturers.

Lawyers building such cases sometimes turn to marketing firms to drum up clients. The marketers turn to finance companies to provide high-interest loans to the clients that have to be repaid only if the clients receive money from the case. Those loans are then used to pay for surgery performed by doctors who are often lined up by the marketers.

Interviews with dozens of women, lawyers, finance executives and marketers, as well as a review of court records and confidential documents, indicate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women have been sucked into this assembly-line-like system. It is fueled by banks, private equity firms and hedge funds, which provide financial backing.

The profits are immense. So are the costs to women. Some suffer physical problems from the surgery. Others say they have become depressed or unable to work. Still others have to get mesh reinserted.

Ms. Plummer’s brush with the industry left her wearing diapers.

Faulty Products

The industry of providing financing to law firms involved in litigation is not new. In recent years, it has expanded into a diverse array of businesses. A spate of companies, such as a Brooklyn outfit named Law Cash, have popped up to provide upfront cash to plaintiffs hoping for big legal settlements.

The litigation surrounding mesh implants is a lucrative niche. These so-called mass tort cases, some of which began six years ago when problems with the implants started to arise, encompass claims brought by tens of thousands of women who say they were harmed by the same products.

Millions of women worldwide received mesh implants. They are used to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman’s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall.

But many women complained that the implants caused problems such as bleeding and discomfort during sex.

Litigation against the implants’ manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, proliferated. There are more than 100,000 plaintiffs in federal court alone. Many more are involved in litigation at the state level or outside the United States.

Representatives of Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson said they stood by the quality of their products. The mesh manufacturers have set aside more than $3 billion to cover potential mesh-related settlements.

Not all plaintiffs are equal. Some law firms — which are paid a percentage of any settlements — realized that women with the implants still in their bodies tended to receive smaller settlements than those who had them taken out.

“Defendants have offered next to nothing to settle cases involving mesh products that have not been removed,” Ms. Plummer’s lawyers at McSweeney Langevin, a small Minneapolis personal injury firm, wrote in a letter advising her to get the implant taken out.

Rhett McSweeney, a co-founder of the law firm, said in a statement that the firm never forced clients to undergo unnecessary surgery and “never directed a client to a particular doctor.”

Plaintiffs’ firms turned to marketers to recruit clients. Women with mesh implants said they soon started receiving torrents of unsolicited phone calls, some originating overseas. The women said they didn’t know how these marketers had found them and seemed to know their medical histories.

“I think my privacy was breached,” said Jennifer Godsoe, 66, who lives in Cumberland, Me. “The more I think about it, the more upset I get.”

Some women had vague memories of answering an online ad about mesh problems. The only thing linking some other women was that they previously had the same doctors, court records show.

Women who took the marketing bait were connected to doctors willing to perform the mesh-removal surgery — although that process remains murky. One critical player was Surgical Assistance, a Florida company led by Wesley Blake Barber, which acted as a middleman between the women, doctors and funding companies. Mr. Barber’s lawyer declined to comment.

In a deposition last summer, Mr. Barber outlined how the company had lined up doctors in Florida and Georgia to perform the surgery. In one online ad, an actor in a white lab coat assures women suffering from their mesh implants that relief is near. By calling a toll-free number, the women will be set up with a “network of qualified surgeons” who remove the mesh without requiring upfront payments.

Women who opted for surgery were flown to Florida and Georgia, put up in motels and sent to walk-in clinics, court filings show. The women generally didn’t meet the doctors who would be operating on them until shortly before the procedure. Before going under the knife, few women got a second opinion.

Dan Christensen, a lawyer who ran MedStar Funding, which financed mesh removal surgery, said in an interview that it was “ludicrous” to argue that women had undergone unnecessary surgery.

“You have to have a doctor willing to put his license on the line,” he said. “Why jeopardize your license?”

$14,000 a Day

The work was lucrative. Doctors stood to make $14,000 a day.

Doctors sometimes churned through four or five removals in a day. Each procedure typically cost about $21,000, according to lawsuits brought by women against the mesh manufacturers. Of that, doctors pocketed roughly $3,500 per surgery; most of the rest went to the medical centers where the surgery took place.

Law Cash offered Danette Charnetzky, a hospice worker in Waynesburg, Ohio, financing for a removal surgery in December 2014. Ms. Charnetzky, another McSweeney client, agreed to pay the money back, at a double-digit interest rate, if the litigation was successful. Within a week, she and her husband were on a plane to a surgical center in a Florida strip mall. The process was a terrifying blur.

“I wish I could have changed my mind, but we were already there,” said Ms. Charnetzky, 49, who hasn’t received any money from the pending litigation against the mesh manufacturer. “I just prayed for the best.”

She got the worst — or something close to it. Ms. Charnetzky said she had needed two more procedures to repair scar tissue left by the Florida surgery.

Rhonda Espeland, 63, who was living in Arizona, also had a bad experience. Since her mesh implant was removed in January 2015, she has developed incontinence. “I may need another surgery,” she said.

The bladder problems have left Ms. Espeland unable to work, and she hasn’t received any money from litigation against her mesh manufacturer. Boxes of diapers are regularly delivered to her door.

The doctor who performed her surgery — and similar procedures on hundreds of others — was Earle M. Pescatore. In March 2014, around the time that he started doing lots of procedures, Mr. Pescatore and his wife filed for bankruptcy, citing liabilities of $1.5 million, including $38,000 they owed to the Internal Revenue Service, according to court filings. Dr. Pescatore said in a deposition that he had little memory of women he operated on.

“Any treatment that Dr. Pescatore provided would have been medically necessary,” his lawyer, Mark DiCowden, said.

While studies have shown that up to 15 percent of women with mesh implants will encounter problems, removing the mesh is not always recommended. Taking it out is more complicated than inserting it because the mesh is made of fiber that is designed to bond with tissue.

Many of the women who got the surgery had limited or no health insurance. They rarely discussed the surgery with their primary care physicians before arriving at the clinics. Some said they had felt rushed into getting surgery.

Dr. Victor Nitti, a surgeon specializing in complex pelvic issues at NYU Langone Health in New York, said serious mesh problems should be addressed with surgery. But, he said, “scaring a patient who has limited to no symptoms into removal is just dangerous and irresponsible.”

Dr. Nitti said he had grown concerned about such scare tactics after some patients told him that they had been contacted by marketers.

Funding Machine

A handful of specialized finance firms funded the surgery that Ms. Plummer, Ms. Espeland and other women got. Court filings show that the two main players are Law Cash and Banyan Finance of Boca Raton, Fla., and that the firms charge double-digit interest rates.

Ross Elgart, Banyan’s chief executive, did not respond to requests for comment.

Lew Fidler, Law Cash’s general counsel, said financing surgical procedures such as Ms. Plummer’s is a small portion of the company’s business. He said the firm, which typically provides cash advances to help plaintiffs pay for everyday expenses, ensures that each surgery is necessary.

“I feel for anyone who didn’t get the outcome they were looking for, but we are not doctors,” Mr. Fidler said. “We don’t substitute our judgment for a licensed physician.”

Law Cash, like other firms, is paid back for a surgical advance only if the person gets a settlement. The firms contend that high interest rates cover the risk that some borrowers will never collect settlements. Some women, however, said the high interest rates had never fully been explained to them.

As a result of those steep interest rates, plaintiffs who do collect settlements see much of the money go to the financing firms. Another large slice goes to their lawyers.

Medical funding for personal injury litigants was a topic of discussion Friday in Las Vegas at the mass tort industry’s big annual conference, titled “Mass Torts Made Perfect.” Law firms are eyeing mesh used to treat hernias as the next gold mine.

The industry has grown thanks in part to a gusher of money from mainstream financial institutions. Law Cash gets funding from DZ Bank, Germany’s second-largest bank, and Melody Capital Partners, a hedge fund with $1.8 billion in assets.

McSweeney Langevin, which has represented more than 1,000 women in mesh litigation, got backing from EJF Capital, a Virginia hedge fund with $10 billion in assets, according to corporate records.

Many of McSweeney’s clients initially were signed up by a now-defunct law and marketing firm, Alpha Law. The Washington firm had signed up 14,000 women for the mesh litigation. Its unusual role in the litigation was the subject of a series of Reuters articles.

The industry tries to keep the network of marketers and financiers out of sight — and some participants have refused to answer questions in depositions, citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

“People are claiming the Fifth and so on and so forth,” said Magistrate Judge Cheryl Eifert in West Virginia, who is hearing one of the mesh cases in federal court. “They don’t have to talk about necessarily how much money they make, per se, but if someone would just give them an idea of how the arrangement works. But nobody’s willing to do that.”

Mr. Barber of Surgical Assistance, for example, asserted the privilege nearly two dozen times in a deposition.

Swollen Like Balloons

Jerri Plummer never figured out whom Yolanda worked for. But in December 2014, Dr. Whitney Shoemaker performed the implant-removal surgery. Until the day of the operation, Ms. Plummer had never spoken to Dr. Shoemaker. Her lawyer declined to comment.

Hours after Ms. Plummer went under the scalpel, she said, she was hustled back to a Hampton Inn just off the freeway, with a catheter sticking out of her side. The next day, a nurse arrived at the motel, removed the catheter and put her in a taxi to the airport.

Soon after she arrived home in Arkansas, she said, complications developed. Her legs swelled like balloons. Her stomach seized up. Ms. Plummer went to her original doctor for help, she said. He informed her that the damage was irreversible. Worse, she said in court records, he told her that there had been no need for the removal surgery.

Before the surgery, Ms. Plummer loved to take walks with her two pit bulls and to eat with her husband at Red Lobster. Now chronic incontinence forces her to wear diapers all day and has left her too worried about wetting herself to venture outside.

With the help of a local lawyer, James R. Baxter, she is suing Law Cash; Dr. Shoemaker; Mr. Barber and his firm, Surgical Assistance; and lawyers at the McSweeney firm.

Mr. McSweeney declined to comment on the lawsuit. His firm is trying to get Ms. Plummer’s lawsuit moved from federal court into private arbitration, where there is no judge or jury. In his statement, he said the firm “had no role” connecting clients with surgical funders like Law Cash or Banyan Finance.

The law firm now has clients sign a waiver that advises them that cash advances to pay for surgery “are terrible loans with extremely high interest rates.”

Ms. Plummer said she had never received such a warning. She feels that she was victimized twice — first by the mesh manufacturer and then by her lawyers and doctor. “I was taken advantage of through this whole process,” she said.Legislation to ensure access to drug samples for generic drug manufacturers has broad support in Congress, from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, on the left to Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, on the right. A similar bill in the House also has diverse backers, including Representatives Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, and Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, who is the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

Under the bill, a generic drug developer could file a lawsuit, and a federal court could require a brand-name drug maker to provide samples of its product to a generic company “on commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” The court could also award damages if it found that a drug maker had refused to sell samples “without a legitimate business justification.”

Brand-name drug companies make several arguments against the legislation. First, they say, it is not needed. The F.D.A. approved 1,027 generic drugs last year, a record number, and nearly 90 percent of prescriptions are filled with generic medicines, suggesting that generic manufacturers have generally been able to obtain the samples they need, the brand-name companies say.

Second, they say, the bill would be a boon to trial lawyers, giving them an incentive to sue brand-name pharmaceutical companies for damages, which could be worth more than sales of the proposed generic drug.

Finally, they say, the legislation could endanger patients because generic drug developers might not follow the strict safety protocols that the government requires for some brand-name drugs.

But the F.D.A. says that “no additional requirements are needed to protect patient safety” in tests to show the equivalence of generic and brand-name drugs. The “testing typically involves a relatively small number of human subjects and a small number of doses and therefore a relatively low level of risk,” the agency said.

At a time when researchers are using sophisticated science to develop new treatments and cures, the fight over physical samples — a few thousand pills — sounds mundane. But it has huge implications for consumers’ access to affordable medicines.

The F.D.A. says it has received more than 150 inquiries from generic drug companies unable to obtain the samples needed to show that a generic product works the same as a brand-name medicine. Some of the disputes over samples involve drugs that are costly to patients and to the Medicare program and that have experienced sharp price increases in recent years.

“Without generic competition, there is no pressure to drive down the costs of these medications,” the food and drug agency said. Under current law, it said, it cannot compel a brand-name drug manufacturer to sell samples to a generic company.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would save the federal government $3.8 billion over 10 years, mainly because Medicare, Medicaid and other health programs would spend less on prescription drugs. Savings for consumers and private health insurance plans could be much greater.

Lawmakers of both parties pushed for the legislation to be included in a far-reaching budget bill signed by Mr. Trump in February, but it was dropped at the last minute.

Even without action by Congress, generic drug companies say the denial of drug samples needed for testing may violate federal antitrust law because it tends to perpetuate a monopoly for the makers of some brand-name medications. But it typically takes years for courts to resolve such claims.

Mylan, a generic drug company, wants to obtain samples to develop a generic version of Revlimid, a brand-name cancer medicine sold by Celgene. At a court hearing in Newark in December, Jonathan M. Jacobson, a lawyer for Mylan, told a federal district judge that “Revlimid costs patients who are dying $20,000 a month.”

“These are some of the most ill patients in the world,” he said, and “if there were generics on the market, the price would be much lower, and people would live longer.”

Celgene said in court papers that it had no obligation to help a potential competitor and that it had “valid business justifications for declining to sell samples on the terms demanded by Mylan.” Moreover, Celgene said its overriding concern was for the safety of patients.

But Mylan, the generic drug company, said this was no excuse because it had devised safety protocols similar to those followed by Celgene.

The secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, has repeatedly said that drug prices are too high. The administration, he said, will soon roll out “a whole slate” of proposals to reduce those prices.

Mr. Azar has suggested that private companies — pharmacy benefit managers — should have a role in negotiating prices for drugs under Part B of Medicare. Those drugs are typically administered by infusion or injection in doctor’s offices and hospital outpatient departments.A public university president in Oregon gives new meaning to the idea of a pensioner.

Joseph Robertson, an eye surgeon who retired as head of the Oregon Health & Science University last fall, receives the state’s largest government pension.

It is $76,111.

Per month.

That is considerably more than the average Oregon family earns in a year.

Oregon — like many other states and cities, including New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut — is caught in a fiscal squeeze of its own making. Its economy is growing, but the cost of its state-run pension system is growing faster. More government workers are retiring, including more than 2,000, like Dr. Robertson, who get pensions exceeding $100,000 a year.

The state is not the most profligate pension payer in America, but its spiraling costs are notable in part because Oregon enjoys a reputation for fiscal discipline. Its experience shows how faulty financial decisions by states can eventually swamp local communities.

Oregon’s costs are inflated by the way in which it calculates pension benefits for public employees. Some of the pensions include income that employees earned on the side. Other retirees benefit from long-ago stock market rallies that inflated the current value of their payouts.

For example, the pension for Mike Bellotti, the University of Oregon’s head football coach from 1995 to 2008, includes not just his salary but also money from licensing deals and endorsements that the Ducks’ athletic program generated. Mr. Bellotti’s pension is more than $46,000 a month.Few analysts, and certainly few Israelis, have suggested that Hamas may actually be rethinking its strategy merely because it has joined what are meant to be nonviolent mass protests and has name-checked the heroes of peaceful civil disobedience.

“It’s quite understandable that when those that proscribe Hamas as a terror organization see Haniya surrounded by icons of peace, it does little to dispel memories of very violent and bloody attacks, including by suicide bombs,” said Beverley Milton-Edwards, an expert on political Islam at the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar who was a co-author of a history of Hamas.

But if Mr. Haniya’s unexpected nod to nonviolence struck some as contradictory and self-serving — as evidence of, one might say, a degree of chutzpah — his organization’s embrace of the Gaza protests had a clear logic that can be understood in much simpler terms.

Terms like “no-brainer.”

Its experiment with popular resistance may or may not be wholehearted, but it is indisputably pragmatic.

A month or two ago, Hamas was cornered. Isolated regionally, rived by internal disputes, it had been unable to ameliorate a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and was increasingly humiliated by the failure of reconciliation talks with Ramallah.

“They had to make too many concessions in the hope of getting a little bit in exchange, and they wound up getting nothing whatsoever,” said Azzam Tamimi, an analyst for a London-based Arabic television channel with close ties to top Hamas leadership.

After a decade running Gaza, and hemmed in by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, Hamas was growing deeply unpopular.

“Though most Gazans would blame Israel fundamentally, and Egypt indirectly, a lot of Palestinians would just do away with all of Hamas to have a better life,” said Tareq Baconi, author of “Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance,” to be published next month by Stanford University Press.

The group was in such dire straits that analysts and Israeli security officials warned it might provoke a new war out of sheer desperation to shake things up.

Yet, even the prospect of war seemed unavailing. Neither Hamas nor Gaza’s two million residents, still recovering from the past two conflicts, in 2012 and 2014, had any appetite for another round of violence.

“They’re absolutely exhausted,” Mr. Baconi said.

To its rockets Israel had responded with the Iron Dome antimissile system. To its tunnels Israel was answering with a $2 billion reinforced-concrete wall buried deep underground. And on Sunday, Israel said it had uncovered and destroyed the longest operational tunnel yet from Gaza.

It was no surprise, then, that after a grass-roots idea for a peaceful, long-lasting protest along the Gaza fence started gaining widespread support, Hamas brought a halt to what had been a fairly steady tempo of rocket launches into Israel and threw its considerable organizational might behind the demonstrations.

By embracing the protests, Hamas cannily aligned itself with a popular movement that became even more popular as it took shape — and that generated an outpouring of international support when Israel responded with gunfire, killing dozens of Palestinians, almost all of them unarmed.

Instantly, the woebegone Palestinian cause and the crisis in Gaza were back in the news, and even the demand for a right of return to Israeli land — one that many supporters of a two-state solution seemed ready to throw overboard — was being taken seriously, cheering Palestinians in refugee camps and the diaspora.

The time was ripe for a popular movement in Gaza, where younger Palestinians, like those on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, have grown disillusioned with the moribund Oslo peace process for self-governance, Mr. Baconi said. Many want to turn the national movement into a campaign for civil rights, rather than simply for statehood.

“Hamas is just jumping on the bandwagon and recognizing the effectiveness of popular resistance at this moment,” he said.

In fact, though it is better known for armed struggle, Hamas has acknowledged the utility of popular resistance since it arose out of the First Intifada in 1987. And last year, it took another subtle step in that direction, adopting a new policy that acknowledged growing support for popular resistance.

Yet, not all Gazans see Hamas’s involvement in the new protests as laudable. Some accused the group of cynically hijacking the demonstrations to serve its own purposes, while still also using young men as cannon fodder.

“It’s beautiful that we find Hamas adopting this nonviolent struggle,” Mohammad Al Taluli, a 26-year-old activist due in court this week on criminal charges for criticizing Hamas online, said sarcastically. “One week before the peaceful protest there was a military maneuver for the Qassam brigades. Do they think they fool us?”

“The gun is no longer a choice,” Mr. Al Taluli added. “It’s a burden on anybody who carries it.”

Yohanan Tzoreff, a former adviser for Arab affairs in Israel’s civil administration in Gaza, viewed the protests through the lens of Hamas’s long-running political rivalry with Fatah, in which Hamas hopes eventually to seize control of the Palestine Liberation Organization, over which Mr. Abbas now maintains a tight grip.

“Which is the way that the people will adopt?” Mr. Tzoreff said. “The way of Ramallah, which means negotiations, negotiations, negotiations, and our entire fight will be at the international level; or the way in Gaza: popular resistance, with a lot of readiness to sacrifice?”

For the moment, the two groups are enjoying an uneasy public truce, with Mr. Abbas expressing solidarity with the Gaza protests.

“Fatah publicly support the protests, but behind closed doors, they criticize them as nothing more than a Hamas stunt,” Ms. Milton-Edwards said.

For Hamas, the fate of its new embrace of popular protest depends on the ability of its leaders, and the Gaza marchers, to walk a fine line along the fence with Israel.

Too much in the way of stone- or firebomb-throwing could spark another heavy-handed Israeli response — and the kind of Palestinian blood bath that could compel Hamas to answer back with rockets.

“The more Israel uses disproportionate force, the harder it is for Hamas to continue holding back from retaliating,” Mr. Baconi said. “At some point, Hamas will start to lose legitimacy if it doesn’t.”Is it safe to come out from under the covers yet, spring?

Women running for office in both parties have long used their status as mothers to explain their policy stances. Kelly Ayotte, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire, ran an ad that cited her children as a reason to cut wasteful spending, said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at the Center for American Women and Politics. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, who gave birth to three children while in Congress, cited her son’s Down syndrome to object to those who would abort fetuses with the condition.

By and large, though, Republican portraits of motherhood have tended to be more traditional, Ms. Dittmar said.

By contrast, this newest group of Democratic candidates seems more outspoken and unconventional. They do not appear to be concerned about research suggesting that motherhood should be conveyed in safe doses — some pictures of the children but not too many lest voters doubt women’s credentials.

Take the breast-feeding videos. In one, Ms. Roys calmly lifts her sweater and lets her fussing baby nurse, while discussing a bill she helped pass in the Wisconsin Legislature banning BPA, a suspected carcinogen, from baby bottles.

In another, Krish Vignarajah, who is hoping to prevail in a crowded Democratic primary to face Maryland’s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, breast-feeds her baby and declares, “There are no women in statewide or federal office in Maryland.” A former policy director for Michelle Obama, Ms. Vignarajah cuts to other scenes of her behind a desk, lists policies, then ends with another breast-feeding shot: “Some say no man can beat Larry Hogan. Well, I’m no man. I’m a mom, I’m a woman and I want to be your next governor.”

Political consultants say that they sense a hunger among many voters for breaking with political conventions and traditional backgrounds for office — the same impatience with politics as usual that made Mr. Trump appealing to his base. So mothers as well as business executives (and some are one and the same) can fit the bill.

Margie Omero, a political consultant, said such portrayals fit with more frankness about a range of topics in society now — sexual harassment in the #MeToo era and conversations about racism — “feeling that your untold story is important to tell.”

Motherhood has long been a political constraint as well as a political advantage. “We don’t see a celebration of women when they advocate for themselves and their grievances, we see it if they advocate for others,” said Jill S. Greenlee, the author of “The Political Consequences of Motherhood” and a political scientist at Brandeis. “When someone says ‘I’m running for office because I’m a mom,’ it re-entrenches that women ought to be moms.”

But she, like others, sees shifts in the political landscape. Some of the new female candidates are younger and have not spent years working their way up from local to state to national political posts. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, said her mother, Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas, had to bank her political ambitions for years.

“My mom would be thrilled to see that women aren’t waiting their turn — they’re just jumping in,” she said. “Back in the day, a woman had to have an entire résumé of accomplishments, three times as long as a man running. A lot of things that women already do — running the PTA, raising children, balancing a job and a family — those are all attributes that make them highly qualified to be in elective office.”

Motherhood can be a credential, but research also suggests that women have to work harder to persuade voters that they have expertise in realms like national security. A study conducted by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation during the 2016 election found voters had the deepest misgivings about mothers with young children, but not about men with young families.

This newest wave of candidates seems undeterred by this thinking — and perhaps is poised to toss it out entirely. “Women are going with their gut,” said Barbara Lee, the foundation’s president. “They’re running as if these obstacles haven’t taken place in the past. It’s their sense of urgency about changing the status quo.”

The status quo, of course, is quite stubbornly in place. This raw portrait of the realities of motherhood as a political calling card doesn’t go over with everyone.

Ms. Roys, the breast-feeding mother running for governor in Wisconsin, said she is still sometimes asked who would take care of her young children if she were to win. One man running for state attorney general told her that he never gets that question.SYRIA-ISRAEL BORDER, Golan Heights — Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Syria is going to explode. I know, you have heard that one before, but this time I mean really explode. Because the U.S., British and French attack on Syria to punish its regime for its vile use of chemical weapons — and Russia’s vow to respond — is actually just the second-most dangerous confrontation unfolding in that country.

Even more dangerous is that Israel and Iran, at the exact same time, seem to be heading for a High Noon shootout in Syria over Iran’s attempts to turn Syria into a forward air base against Israel, something Israel is vowing to never let happen. This is not mere speculation. In the past few weeks — for the first time ever — Israel and Iran have begun quietly trading blows directly, not through proxies, in Syria.

And this quiet phase may be about to end.

Israel and Iran are now a hair-trigger away from going to the next level — and if that happens, the U.S. and Russia may find it difficult to stay out.

Let me try to explain what is unfolding from a lookout post on the Syrian-Israel border, where I stood a couple of days ago. To follow along at home, I highly recommend this website, which tracks the multiple interlocking Syrian conflicts in real time and is used by the U.N. observers here on the Golan Heights.Last month, the president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, unveiled the design for a national cathedral that the government will build in Accra. This is a huge deal. It signals that the country is poised to consolidate the gains of decades of democracy. And the new interdenominational Christian cathedral will inspire ambitious civic architecture projects across the continent that harness the talents of Africa’s emerging artists.

Not everyone is cheering, though. Some West Africans have complained that the mixing of church and state is ill advised. They argue that it’s a worrisome case of official partisanship in a part of the world rived by religious conflicts. Others say the money for the project should have instead been invested in schools, hospitals and infrastructure — stuff that, according to them, Africa really needs. They are right to point to these endemic problems; but they are wrong to connect them with the cathedral.

The cathedral is the first major project in Africa by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who was knighted last year for his services to his field. He is perhaps the most exciting architect in the world. His reputation is built on his stunning designs for Rivington Place in London, the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, and, most spectacularly, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.

This Accra commission is not just a recognition by his homeland of Mr. Adjaye’s acclaim. It also signifies that Africa can build a major work by a leading architect at the top of his game. This is a remarkable thing: Ghana will get to brag about a globally recognized architectural landmark.Desperation focuses the mind. As the elections loom, Republicans must resist the impulse to become full-time campaigners instead of legislators. That would only reinforce the public perception of Congress as a dysfunctional mess and incumbents as swamp-dwellers more concerned with their political survival (and self-enrichment) than with the national welfare.

Instead, the party should approach the elections under the banner of an ambitious program to bring economic revival to the working class. The starting point for such a program would be Mr. Trump’s campaign-trail commitment to rebuild our decaying national infrastructure — including the roads, schools, hospitals and other civic assets that have been squeezed by conservative cutbacks.

A Trump New Deal could also include other elements with strong appeal to working-class voters, such as vigorous support for universal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare (as opposed to means-tested programs that benefit only the poor), robust wage subsidies, a generous child care tax credit and apprenticeship programs linked to specific high-skilled jobs. Republicans might also consider a national version of a California proposal to make housing more affordable.

A Republican campaigning on the back of a Trump New Deal could sell himself or herself as someone who shares the values of voters in the economically ravaged American heartland but who also has a real program to address their problems. It would be a lot more persuasive than just touting the magic of tax cuts.

The president would relish an initiative built around the most popular parts of his agenda; he might even find it in his self-interest to call Congress into a special session to pass it. Republicans running for re-election could present themselves as loyal to Mr. Trump’s overarching goals while avoiding the president’s toxic tweets and scandals. Democrats would be reluctant to give Mr. Trump a political win heading into the elections, but equally reluctant to offer him a legitimate opportunity to paint them as partisan obstructionists. Entrenched special interests would be outraged by any Republican move toward the economic center, but the Koch brothers and other big donors would still work for Republican majorities to supply the regulatory relief and conservative justices they crave.

The idea of a New Deal advanced by Republicans, even as unorthodox a Republican as Mr. Trump, sounds like alternate-reality science fiction. But historically the Republican Party has not been an organization with a fixed identity. Its transformation into a conservative ideological force began to take root only in the 1960s and took half a century to complete. It’s hardly impossible for the party to move toward the economic center while continuing to embrace Trump-style cultural populism.

Political scientists who specialize in what’s called “realignment theory” point out that America’s two main political parties have flipped constituencies and ideologies in the past. Before the New Deal, the Democrats were predominantly a rural, socially conservative agrarian party allied with a number of urban political machines, while Republicans were advocates of powerful government and the party of intellectuals, African-Americans and the native-born working class.This is not to say that he lacked principles. The frequent descriptions of Ryan as a Jack Kemp acolyte — a supply-side tax cutter and entitlement reformer and free trader who imagined a more immigrant-welcoming and minority-friendly G.O.P. — were accurate enough; there was no question that the more a policy reflected Ryan’s deepest preferences, the more Kempist it would be.

But even there, he came to those principles at a time when they were ascendant within the party — in the period between the supply-side ’80s and the late-1990s window when centrist liberals seemed open to entitlement reform. And then as Republicans moved away from them, tacking now more compassionate-conservative, now more libertarian, now more Trumpist, his resistance to the drift was always gentle, eclipsed by his willingness to turn.

Thus the Ryan of the George W. Bush era cast votes for the pillars of compassionate conservatism, No Child Left Behind and Medicare Part D. Then the Ryan of the Tea Party era championed austerity, talking about “makers and takers” and tossing out the Ayn Rand references that persuaded many liberals that he was an ideological fanatic. But that Ryan gave way to Ryan the dutiful running mate, which gave way in turn to the more moderate Ryan of Obama’s second term, who negotiated a budget deal with Democrats and moved toward so-called “reform conservatism” in his policy proposals at a time when that seemed like that might be the party’s future.

Then came the 2016 election, in which Ryan temporarily resisted Trump and then surrendered lest he break the party (which a party man could never do), and after that the Trump administration, in which Ryan has obviously steered Trump toward standard Republican policies — but has just as obviously been steered as well. Most of Ryan’s past big-picture goals (entitlement reform, free trade, minority outreach) are compromised or gone, and while he attempted Obamacare repeal and achieved a butchered version of corporate tax reform, he’s accepted spending policies that make a mockery of any sort of libertarian or limited-government goal.

If you look at all this and see an obsessive ideologue working tirelessly for Randian ends, I think you’re being daft. But it’s equally daft to see this as the story of a great visionary brought low by Trump. The truth is that Ryan probably could have thrived as a legislator in a variety of dispensations: As a Reaganite if he’d been born early enough; as a Kempian or compassionate conservative if the late-1990s boom had continued; as a bipartisan dealmaker in a world where his base supported compromises (the blueprints he drew up with Democrats like Ron Wyden were usually interesting); as some sort of reform-conservative-inflected figure under a President Rubio or Kasich.But meditating is just another thing. Yoga? Another task, another item for the to-do list.

This battle between striving and serenity may be distinctly American. The struggle between toil and the dream of ease is an American birthright, the way a Frenchman expects to have decent wine at a reasonable price, and the whole month of August on vacation.

Maybe it goes all the way back to the Declaration of Independence, our founding document. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. How proud I’ve always been, through the years of protesting, the radical this and progressive that of my 1960s generation, to think of those words.

That unlikely word — happiness — made me proud to be an American, not just for my own sake, but that everyone was enjoined to find a personal project of delight. Of course happiness is an illusion. Still, I’ll pledge allegiance to it.

But happiness is the only word in the Declaration of Independence triad that doesn’t stand alone. Happiness is not, like life and liberty, a given. Happiness in the American credo is a job. It must be pursued. It may not be clear what happiness is, but you better get hold of it. Your fault, sucker, if you can’t somehow nab it for yourself.

The essential American word isn’t happiness. It’s pursuit.

This is where the struggle is engaged, happiness as a national enterprise. Its pursuit is the loneliness coiled within the heart of the American dream.

Even a postmodern to-do list is not the answer. Go ahead — meditate, do yoga, eat probiotic foods, all that.

But how about just giving up? What about wasting time? Giving up or perhaps giving over. To what? Perhaps what an earlier age called “the life of the mind,” the phrase that describes the sovereign self at ease, at home in the world. This isn’t the mind of rational thought, but the lost music of wondering, the sheer value of looking out the window, letting the world float along. It’s nothing, really, this wasted time, which is how it becomes, paradoxically, charged with “everything,” liberated into the blessed loss of ambition.It was two days after the young Yemeni man was released from surgery that the doctors first noticed the smell. The bullet that wounded the leg of the 22-year-old college student had shattered bone and torn a hole in the soft tissue. Now, the wound was emitting a distinct smell, described in the medical literature as “offensive.” It strongly suggested infection, perhaps life-threatening, and the wound was not getting better.

Realizing that normal antibiotics were not working, the doctors at a trauma center run by Doctors Without Borders sent a blood culture for analysis to their new microbiology lab, the only one of its kind in the region. The tests found a bacterium, Acinetobacter baumannii, resistant to most standard antibiotics. Nobody knows how the student — who was identified using his initials, A. S., to preserve his privacy — acquired the drug-resistant infection, but it is so common in Yemen that it could have come from the bullet itself or the sand on the ground when he fell, said Dr. Nagwan Mansoor, the chief physician in Doctors Without Borders’s antibiotic stewardship program.

Doctors started the gunshot victim on a program of specialized antibiotics, medicines rarely used because of their potentially dangerous side effects. He required numerous surgeries, seven in all. What would normally have been a five-day stay became three weeks, during which the man was put into isolation to prevent him from infecting other patients. When his family came to visit, they could not touch him without wearing protective clothing.

A. S. survived. “We captured the patient from the mouth of death,” said Dr. Mansoor. But A. S. was lucky: Most hospitals in Yemen do not have the capacity or protocols in place to detect and treat drug-resistant infections; if he had been anywhere else, he would have lost his leg, or died.Does studying mathematics enhance your overall mental prowess?

Abraham Lincoln certainly believed so, embarking on the arduous task of mastering Euclid’s treatises on geometry to increase his cognitive capacities, in particular his linguistic and logical abilities. This idea — that mathematics strengthens your mind much as physical exercise strengthens your body, helping you negotiate a variety of mental challenges — goes all the way back to Plato. Alive and well in today’s world, it is one reason popularly given for why everyone should study mathematics.

So it can come as a surprise to learn that cognitive psychologists have a different take on the issue. Various studies point to the conclusion that subjecting the mind to formal discipline — as when studying geometry or Latin — does not, in general, engender a broad transfer of learning. There is no sweeping increase of a general capacity for tasks like writing a speech or balancing a checkbook.

But surely a narrower claim is true: that mathematics, so systematically built as it is on inference, must develop logical thinking. Right?

By “logical,” I mean the kind of thinking needed to solve the following problem:

Four cards are laid in front of you, each of which, it is explained, has a letter on one side and a number on the other. The sides that you see read E, 2, 5 and F. Your task is to turn over only those cards that could decisively prove the truth or falsity of the following rule: “If there is an E on one side, the number on the other side must be a 5.” Which ones do you turn over?Photo

MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan — Four attacks across Afghanistan on Saturday night and Sunday killed at least 26 government security officers, while two schools were also set ablaze, according to Afghan officials.

The four attacks struck government outposts in northern and eastern Afghanistan; at least three appeared coordinated. They occurred late at night or early in the morning, with the attackers using long-range sniper rifles and night-vision equipment, according to Afghan officials, who tallied at least 10 wounded in all, along with those killed.

In separate assaults, a girls’ high school in Logar Province, near the capital, Kabul, was burned on April 11, and masked attackers struck a school in the village of Momandara, in Nangarhar Province, on Saturday night, setting archives and labs ablaze, according to education officials.

No one was reported hurt in those two attacks.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but government officials blamed Taliban insurgents for the attacks on the government outposts. In recent years, mainstream Taliban forces have normally refrained from attacking schools.

In the Sancharak District, in the northern Sar-i-Pul Province, which has teetered between government and Taliban control over the past year, the governor, Naqibullah Daqiq, said that two government checkpoints in the west had been attacked by Taliban fighters using night-vision equipment and sniper rifles, with one guard killed at first.

When local pro-government militiamen tried to counter the assault, they fell into a Taliban ambush, and 10 others were killed, Mr. Daqiq said.

Nematullah Tofan, the police chief of the district of Dawlat Abad, in another northern province, Faryab, said that two government checkpoints in the village of Khairabad had fallen to Taliban fighters after their snipers killed four government defenders, shooting each of them in the head.

Attacks by insurgents using sophisticated night-vision technology have risen in the past year, especially against police and militia units that do not have such equipment. Afghan officials have asked for the gear to be issued to their police officers, but American officials have been reluctant to do so for fear that it would fall into Taliban hands.

The third attack was in Ghazni Province, in southeastern Afghanistan, where two Afghan Local Police checkpoints in the district of Jaghatu were attacked at 2 a.m. Sunday, killing eight officers and wounding four others, according to Hamidullah Nawruz, a member of the Ghazni provincial council.

Afghan Local Police officers are militiamen defending their own communities; they are generally less trained and not as well equipped as the national police.

A fourth attack took place on Sunday afternoon, when three guards outside Nangarhar University in the eastern city of Jalalabad took a break for worship. Gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on them while they were praying, killing two immediately, according to a news release from the provincial governor’s office. The third guard fled but was chased by the gunmen and killed as well, according to a witness who insisted on anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The girls’ high school in Logar Province, in a village in Mohammad Agha District, was attacked on April 11 by gunmen who beat up the night watchmen and locked them in a room, then set the school afire, according to Kabir Haqmal, a spokesman for the Ministry of Education. It was unclear why the attack had not been previously disclosed.

The school has 981 female students and 21 teachers, Mr. Haqmal said. It is in the home district of President Ashraf Ghani, 35 miles from Kabul.

In Nangarhar Province, the attack in Momandara was the third time a school in that district had been targeted in the past month, according to Mohammad Asif Shinwari, a spokesman for the provincial education ministry.

Attacks on schools by Taliban insurgents were common 10 years ago but proved so unpopular with communities that the insurgents announced that they would not be continued, even claiming to support girls’ education, although few such schools operate in areas dominated by the militants.She does macro, too — she was joined onstage by approximately 100 dancers, singers and musicians, a stunning tableau that included fraternity pledges and drumlines and rows of female violinists in addition to the usual crackerjack backup dancers (which here included bone breakers and also dancers performing elaborate routines with cymbals).

Some superstars prize effortlessness, but Beyoncé shows her work — the cameras captured the force and determination in her dancing, and also her sweat. She performed for almost two hours, with only a few breaks, and her voice rarely flagged. Occasionally her set was punctuated with fireworks that, compared with what was happening onstage, seemed dull.

Beyoncé was originally meant to perform at Coachella last year, but rescheduled for this April after becoming pregnant; her Coachella performances this weekend and next are her only solo U.S. dates this year. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she said midset, then added an aside that was, in fact, the main point: “Ain’t that ’bout a bitch.”

Big-tent festivals, generally speaking, are blithe spaces — they don’t invite much scrutiny, because they can’t stand up to it. But Beyoncé’s simple recitation of fact was searing, especially on the same night that, in Cleveland, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame finally inducted Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, 15 and 45 years after their deaths, and also Bon Jovi, a band in which everyone is very much alive.

She was arguing not in defense of herself, but of her forebears. And her performance was as much ancestral tribute and cultural continuum — an uplifting of black womanhood — as contemporary concert. She sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the black national anthem, incorporated vocal snippets of Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and nodded at Ms. Simone’s “Strange Fruit.”

And she rendered her personal history as well. During the second half of the show, she unfurled a kind of This Is Your Life in reverse. First came her husband, Jay-Z, on “Déjà Vu” — with him, she was affectionate while easily outshining him. Then, a true surprise: a reunion with her former Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, during which she happily ceded the main spotlight. After that came a playful dance routine with her sister, Solange, on “Get Me Bodied.” (Sadly, there was no “Ring Off” with her mother, nor a rendition of “Daddy Lessons” with her father.)

As Beyoncé has gotten older, she’s been making music that’s increasingly visceral, both emotionally and historically. She is one of the only working pop stars who need not preoccupy herself with prevailing trends, or the work of her peers. She is an institution now, and that has allowed her freedom. “Lemonade” is her most accomplished album, and also a wild and risky one — thematically but also musically.

That may be one reason that last year, Beyoncé lost the Grammy for album of the year to Adele, the sort of upset that triggered a storm of criticism about the Grammys’ relevance, and, effectively, an almost-apology from Adele. In time, though, that moment will feel like a glitch. That space on the mantel will be filled by a National Medal of the Arts, or a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Like no other musician of her generation apart from Kanye West, Beyoncé is performing musicology in real time. It is bigger than any tribute she might receive. History is her stage.The men, who have not been identified, were arrested on suspicion of trespassing. But Starbucks did not want to press charges and the men were later released, Commissioner Richard Ross Jr. of the Philadelphia Police Department said in a recorded statement on Saturday.

The prosecutor’s office in Philadelphia also reviewed the case and declined to charge the men because of “a lack of evidence that a crime was committed,” Benjamin Waxman, a spokesman for the office, said.

The company apologized on Twitter Saturday afternoon. Later that day, while the hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter, Kevin R. Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, released a statement in which he called the situation a “reprehensible outcome.”

Mr. Johnson said he hoped to meet them in person to offer a “face-to-face apology.”

He also pledged to investigate, and to “make any necessary changes to our practices that would help prevent such an occurrence from ever happening again.”

“Starbucks stands firmly against discrimination or racial profiling,” he said. “Regretfully, our practices and training led to a bad outcome — the basis for the call to the Philadelphia Police Department was wrong. Our store manager never intended for these men to be arrested and this should never have escalated as it did.”

A company spokesman late on Saturday would not say whether any employees would face discipline.

A longer video of the episode shows the police talking with the men for at least four minutes before Mr. Yaffe arrives. He informs the police that the men they are about to take into custody are “not trespassing” but instead are “meeting me here.”

“That’s absolutely discrimination,” Mr. Yaffe said in the video. A lawyer for the men did not immediately respond to an email or phone message seeking comment late Saturday. Mr. Yaffe declined to comment.

In his statement, Commissioner Ross defended his officers, noting they had asked the men to leave three times because employees had said they were trespassing. The men refused, he said.

“These officers had legal standing to make this arrest,” Commissioner Ross said. “These officers did absolutely nothing wrong. They followed policy, they did what they were supposed to do, they were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen — and instead they got the opposite back.

“I will say that as an African-American male, I am very aware of implicit bias,” he continued. “We are committed to fair and unbiased policing, and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department.”

About 700 of the department’s 6,300 officers are equipped with body cameras, he added, but the officers involved were not wearing them.

Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia, blamed Starbucks, saying that the episode “appears to exemplify what racial discrimination looks like in 2018.”

“Starbucks has issued an apology, but that is not enough,” he said in a statement. He said he has asked the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations to examine the company’s policies and procedures.

Starbucks said such a review was already underway.

“I know our store managers and partners work hard to exceed our customers’ expectations every day — which makes this very poor reflection on our company all the more painful,” Mr. Johnson said in his statement. He added: “You can and should expect more from us. We will learn from this and be better.”The Ulster case began when a 19-year-old woman said she was raped in June 2016 at a party at Mr. Jackson’s home. In a text to a friend a day after the house party, she appeared intimidated by the prospect of facing down the men she had accused: “I’m not going to the police. I’m not going up against Ulster Rugby. Yea, because that’ll work.”

Mr. Jackson and Mr. Olding were charged with rape and sexual assault. The trial centered on whether the woman had consented to the acts performed on her, and on the sometimes contradictory accounts of what had been done, and by whom, on a night fueled by alcohol.

Mr. Olding said he had had consensual oral sex with the woman, but both men denied having had vaginal sex with her. A taxi driver who took her home testified that she had been “sobbing throughout the journey” and that he saw blood on the back of her white jeans. A doctor told the court that he had observed a laceration in her bleeding vagina. But defense experts argued that this was not proof of rape or even that she had had sex.

The young woman spent eight days on the witness stand being questioned by each of the defendants’ lawyers. She sat in court while her underwear was passed around for the jury to examine. Defense lawyers cited testimony that said the young woman did not physically resist or scream for help from other women downstairs.

The criminal law in Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, is based on the principle that guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. And after a grueling trial, the two players — and two of their friends who had been charged with lesser offenses — were unanimously cleared by a jury of eight men and three women after less than four hours of deliberation.

On the steps of the courthouse, Mr. Jackson’s lawyer, Joe McVeigh, strongly criticized the complainant and the police for taking the case. Mr. Olding, speaking through his lawyer, maintained that everything had been consensual but said: “I am sorry for the hurt that was caused to the complainant.”

But anti-rape and women’s rights activists said that some of the evidence produced in court, particularly private WhatsApp messages sent among the young men and their friends, had raised disturbing questions about the attitude of some Irish men toward sex, consent and women in general.

Court records showed that after the party, Mr. Olding posted a message — “We are all top shaggers” — to a private WhatsApp group that included Mr. Jackson. The group exchanged boastful, abusive and misogynistic messages that appeared to refer to the young woman, including, “Mate no jokes she was in hysterics.” One member of the group concluded a graphic exchange with “Legends!! … Why are we all such legends?”

Defense lawyers argued that the comments were exaggerated boyish banter. But those remarks, and the vitriol unleashed by some of the men’s supporters against the woman, whose identity is protected in Northern Ireland’s legal system, were condemned.

After the verdict, some called for her to be named and said she should be punished for trying to ruin the lives of innocent young men.

Luke Rossiter, a semiprofessional player with Drogheda United soccer team in the Irish Republic, called on Twitter for her to be “locked up” and directed obscene abuse at women who had supported her. He later apologized for his “stupid and immature” comments and vowed to donate his wages for the rest of the season to a rape crisis center.

Willie John McBride, a celebrated former player for the Ireland rugby team, which represents both parts of the island, gave the players more measured support on a Dublin-based radio show this past week.

“The guys have come through a very traumatic couple of months where they’ve virtually been tried on television every day, walking in and out of the court,” he said, adding, “It is time they were back playing rugby again.”

The verdict failed to quell the rising anger of supporters of the young woman and survivors of sexual violence, who continued to rally under the hashtag #ibelieveher. (When Mr. Jackson’s lawyers threatened after the verdict to sue anyone who attacked his client or questioned the verdict on social media, a blizzard of defiant responses emerged under #suemepaddy.)

The following week, Mr. Jackson put out a more contrite statement: “I am ashamed that a young woman who was a visitor to my home left in a distressed state. This was never my intention, and I will always regret the events of that evening.”

Cara Cash-Marley, the chief executive of Nexus, a rape counseling service in Northern Ireland, said the trial had again exposed the onerous burden of proof placed on those who brought sexual assault complaints.

She said complainants should be allowed to record their evidence when it was fresh in their minds, rather than be expected to repeat it many times over — and finally to be aggressively cross-examined in court years later.

Cliona Saidlear, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, said the case may have spurred a new willingness to re-examine prevailing attitudes about sex and consent. “There is a macho culture in sport, and a hookup culture,” she said. “And we have to say, just because it is this way, does it have to be that way?”

The decision to sack the two players came amid commercial sponsors’ concerns that the men’s return would damage the image of a sport that has grown in popularity in recent years — not least among Irish women.

But a recent episode hinted at the hurdles still remaining. In Belfast this past week, the Malone rugby club said that it was investigating a photograph that had emerged of two players simulating sex acts with a trophy cup, the names of Mr. Jackson and Mr. Olding stuck to their torsos.Many veterans and defense experts, however, are aghast, arguing that the policy could undermine unit cohesion and set a dangerous precedent for other Western armies. But many declined to go on the record with their criticism.

Danny Lams, a former Dutch paratrooper and chairman of a veterans’ organization, condemned the plans.

“You do not go to a war zone with men who miss their mama,” he told The Guardian. “We used to sleep on the cold ground under a leaky tarpaulin. We wanted to serve our country.”

“If you allow the recruits to go home during the week, the military will soon ask for a mobile home if they are sent to the front,” he added.

Belgium would be the first country in modern Western military history to make such a move, according to experts from the European Defense Agency, which monitors defense capabilities of European Union member states.

“Every army trains to go to war, and there will be no sleeping at home when you go to war,” said Vir Maram, 35, a reservist corporal of the French Foreign Legion who served several tours under the command of Western armies and NATO in Afghanistan, Iraq and Mali and who is studying international security in Brussels.

“An army evolves with the way that it fights,” he added, “but the only thing that changes are the weapons we fight with — the nature of war itself doesn’t change, and so the basic principles of the army don’t change.”

Military service was mandatory in Belgium until 1994 for men turning 18 or ending their studies for one year. Since then, the head count of the country’s armed forces has gradually diminished, to about 28,500 active personnel from 40,000.

Belgium now has about 2.6 soldiers per 1,000 civilians, fewer than many of its NATO allies. And the average age has crept up.

“It’s almost like a Dad’s Army,” said Roger Housen, a retired colonel in the Belgian armed forces, referring to a television comedy about the British Home Guard, a World War II volunteer force made up of men exempt from conscription, often because they were considered too old to fight.

“The army is right to try to attract more youngsters, as many senior personnel will retire over the next five years,” Colonel Housen said. But the requirement to live in barracks, he said, was not the main factor driving young people away.

About 20 percent to 25 percent of recruits chose to end their contracts early, official army statistics show, but only 16 percent of those who leave say they do so because of “family reasons.”

More important, Colonel Housen said, was the effect of cuts in the Belgian defense budget over the past decades, which meant that “young people don’t have the appropriate equipment, they lack the means to train in a convenient way, they don’t have the right garrisons, the right training infrastructure, they don’t have the required readiness.”

“As a matter of fact, they can’t do the things they want to do, and the things they joined the armed forces for,” he added.

Mr. Claes, the army spokesman, said that a growing economy and increasingly lucrative civilian jobs for young people had kept many millennials away from the military. Others, he added, deem the prospect of patrolling the streets of Antwerp and Brussels under the country’s continuing counterterrorism operation, Vigilant Guardian, not adventurous enough.

Belgium’s military expenditure as a share of gross domestic product was 0.91 percent in 2017, down from almost 1 percent in 2010, the second-lowest proportion in NATO, after Luxembourg; NATO guidelines request 2 percent.

About 1,000 Belgian troops are currently active abroad: Forty soldiers are stationed in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, and 100 others are training local forces in Mali. Every six months, six Belgian F-16 fighter jets take turns with Dutch warplanes to patrol the air space above Iraq and Syria and to carry out bombing raids against Islamic State targets. Belgian ships regularly take part in missions to control the international waters off the coast of Europe.

“Contributions to NATO operations are important,” said Oana Lungescu, the senior spokeswoman for NATO. “But so are defense spending and having the right capabilities.”

As for Mr. Maram, the Legionnaire, he said: “In the French Foreign Legion, we stay in the barracks for the first five years.”

“What do you want next, the army can go on strike? You want unions in the army?” he said, bursting into laughter. “How I hate the 21st century!”Other western European countries have had trouble squarely facing such history; many Belgians were unaware of the atrocities in Congo under Belgian rule until the past generation. But Denmark, with less of a colonial record to confront than some countries, has had more trouble confronting it, according to Mr. Palsson.

“Somehow it annoys them more than others knowing about this background,” he said.

Hans Jonathan was born in 1784 in St. Croix, then a Danish possession and now part of the United States Virgin Islands. His mother was a black house slave owned by the Schimmelmanns, a Danish-German family, and his father was a white man.

When he was about 7, the Schimmelmanns took him to Copenhagen. In 1801, he volunteered to fight with the Danish navy, and emerged unharmed from a fierce battle with British ships.

“It was crazy warfare,” said Mr. Palsson, whose biography of Hans Jonathan was published in Icelandic in 2014, and in English in 2016. “The ship was bombarded heavily.”

Hans Jonathan earned the support of his superior officers, who spoke on his behalf to the royal household. Denmark’s crown prince and de facto ruler, the future King Frederik VI, wrote in a letter that Hans Jonathan “is considered free and enjoys rights.”

The French revolution had unleashed new ideas about equality and liberty. Like several other colonial powers, Denmark still allowed slavery in the Caribbean, but abolition movements at home were gaining ground, and the status of slaves brought to Europe from the colonies was murky.

Henrietta Schimmelmann tried to reclaim Hans Jonathan and take him back to St. Croix, and he went to court to assert his freedom, in a case that was famous in its time. But he could not produce the letter from Prince Frederik, for reasons unknown, and in 1802, the court dismissed his claim and ordered him to return to the Schimmelmanns, who wanted to sell him in St. Croix.

Instead, he fled, sailed to Iceland, settled in the small village of Djupivogur, married a local woman, had children, and lived as a free man until his death in 1827.

Though he was largely forgotten in Denmark, in Iceland he became a well-known figure in local folklore, said Kari Stefansson, head of the company deCode Genetics, whose father grew up in Djupivogur.

“People think it’s a beautiful story,” he said. “It shows that racism isn’t innate. It’s a learned behavior.”

DeCode published a study this year that takes advantage of Iceland’s highly homogeneous gene pool, its remarkably thorough genealogical records, and Hans Jonathan’s unique place in the country’s history.

Researchers identified some 780 living descendants of Hans Jonathan, took DNA samples from 182 of them, and isolated snippets that were characteristically African, and could only have come from him. They said they were able to reconstruct 38 percent of his mother’s genome, and trace it to parts of West Africa.

“It is certainly of interest how bits and pieces of an African genome are found in genomes of current Icelanders,” Mr. Stefansson said.

Some Icelanders knew of Hans Jonathan already, but many of his descendants, who are spread among several countries, lived most of their lives unaware that they had an ancestor who was a black slave.

Among them was Kirsten Pflomm, a communications manager from Connecticut, who did an online search of her own name 15 years ago, and found herself and entire family listed on a website written in Icelandic. She contacted the site’s administrator and learned the dramatic story of her five-times-great-grandfather.

”I clearly look very white,” she said. ”So I can’t claim to ever have experienced anything” resembling racism.

Ms. Pflomm is not seeking an official apology for Hans Jonathan’s time in shackles, or hoping to achieve greater Danish awareness of slavery and colonization. “That’s a bigger conversation that doesn’t include me,” she said.

But she petitioned Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, asking him to award Hans Jonathan his freedom. In a letter back to her, the prime minister wrote last month that her ancestor was a “beacon of liberty,” but that he “cannot reverse time or the verdict of the past, no matter how incomprehensible it may seem.”

But Astrid Nonbo Andersen, an expert on colonial history at the Danish Institute for International Studies, said that Danish views may have begun to change last year, during the centennial of the sale of the Denmark’s Caribbean islands to the United States.

“There was an explosion of events like never before,” she said. “But if it was just a news interest or something lasting remains to be seen.”

The wealth of the colonial era is visible in the elegant Rococo and Baroque mansions of Copenhagen. The first tribute to the people who suffered to create that wealth appeared on April 2, when a statue was unveiled of a black woman who led a 19th-century rebellion against Danish rule on St. Croix.

The statue, 23 feet tall, may be hard to ignore.

“It’s really big and right on the waterfront,” Ms. Andersen said. “Tourists will begin to ask, and tour guides will have to add a new chapter to their guiding.”Mr. Zuckerberg even said several times that he was open to new regulations aimed at his company, without committing to any particular approach.

The difference was clear, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, who has seen both Facebook and Microsoft up close. He questioned Mr. Zuckerberg in Congress, and in the 1990s, as Connecticut’s attorney general, he helped lead the states’ antitrust assault on Microsoft.

“Facebook has already taken very much to heart the clear lessons of Microsoft, which is to engage fully and aggressively in dialogue with federal powers,” he said by phone. “Microsoft basically refused to have any real conversations with D.O.J. or the states before we filed suit. Essentially, it stonewalled negotiations before there was a judgment by the courts.”

Asked if the example of Microsoft had guided any of Facebook’s strategy in dealing with federal powers, a Facebook spokeswoman said, “As Mark told Congress, we made mistakes and we’re taking action to make sure that they don’t happen again.

“Everything we’re doing has been guided by the understanding that we need to do better,” the spokeswoman, Vanessa Chan, added.

By March 1998, when Mr. Gates appeared in Congress, Microsoft seemed all but invincible, its market dominance and ambitions at their peak. It had made forays into online commerce, media and advertising, and executives in one industry after another anxiously awaited the company’s next move.

Bankers raised the specter of a new online rival: The First National Bank of Redmond they called it, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Rupert Murdoch declared that the company he feared most was Microsoft. Microsoft had its own online magazine, Slate, as well as newsroom and programming studios, and it joined forces with NBC to help start MSNBC.

The first internet boom was also in full swing, and Microsoft’s Windows software — the operating system on 90 percent of the world’s personal computers — controlled that gateway to the future with its browser, Internet Explorer.

But there was an insurgent in Microsoft’s world, the Silicon Valley start-up Netscape, creator of the first commercially successful internet browser. The browser had the potential to be the on ramp to the internet, undermining Windows. Microsoft portrayed Internet Explorer as a mere feature of its operating system. The software giant was intent on winning the “browser war” with Netscape, using every weapon it had to squelch the upstart.

The federal government and several states investigated Microsoft’s behavior. Years of tangles with competition regulators in Europe followed, along with a string of private antitrust lawsuits.

After it lost the federal antitrust case in America, Microsoft, with little choice, sued for peace, spending billions of dollars in settlements and fines. It submitted to monitors who would file regular reports on the company’s compliance with its settlements. Several years later, Mr. Gates gave up day-to-day control of the company and became the country’s leading philanthropist.

“The view was that government was irrelevant and we can do anything we want,” said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who has studied Microsoft for years. “There was little respect for government, and that was the culture inside Microsoft at the time.”

Today, Facebook finds itself squarely in the public spotlight, but confronting a different set of policy challenges.

The concern about Microsoft was economic. Consumers might pay somewhat higher prices, but mainly they would suffer because future innovations would be thwarted.

Facebook is under attack because of privacy concerns, its data-handling practices and its vulnerability to be used by others to spread lies, hatred and political propaganda. The main worry is that the social network is being manipulated to shape human behavior. And Facebook’s data harvesting and the potential impact are far more personal than anything Microsoft did.

Tom Rubin, a former senior lawyer at Microsoft who is now a lecturer at Stanford University, sees many parallels between the government scrutiny of Microsoft and of Facebook, which he discussed with a class on tech policy at the school this past week.

“They both involve an allegation that a digital gatekeeper, with insufficient internal controls, drove for dominance by harming the ecosystem in which it operates,” said Mr. Rubin, who was an assistant United States attorney before joining Microsoft.

But the stakes now, he said, are higher than in the days when the public was still figuring out how to get onto the internet. “Competition in the marketplace for browsers pales in comparison to protecting personal privacy and a functioning democracy,” Mr. Rubin said. “It’s hard to conceive of a higher priority for legislators and regulators than that.”

One risk for Facebook could come from an emerging group of antitrust experts who advocate expanding the definition of consumer welfare beyond pricing and innovation, to include the impact on workers, small retailers and privacy. The German antitrust authorities are pursuing a case against Facebook alleging that its market dominance essentially forces users to accept a service that violates their privacy.

But that approach, most experts say, is a stretch, particularly in the United States.

“The idea is that they’re big, so antitrust should be used to address the problem,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “But if you’re looking for a privacy remedy, antitrust is not the right tool.”

An alternative threat is much stricter privacy regulation, following the European lead. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect next month, is far more restrictive than data collection and trading practices in America. It requires companies to collect and store only the minimum amount of user data needed to provide a specific, stated service.

In the United States, that would mean stronger laws and more resources for privacy and data-protection enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and states.

“That is arguably a much more effective solution to this kind of problem — get the privacy regime right,” said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington University Law School and a former chairman of the F.T.C.

But like the antitrust concerns, any major overhaul of privacy law in Washington appears unlikely anytime soon.

Still, the smart move for Facebook, said A. Douglas Melamed, who was a senior antitrust official in the Justice Department during the Microsoft case, would be to depart from the old Microsoft playbook of resistance and embrace new, tougher rules on privacy and data-handling practices — and help guide them.

“That would move the conversation away from ‘Are these bad guys?’ to ‘How can we work together to solve these problems?’” Mr. Melamed, a professor at Stanford Law School, said. “And if Facebook really does that, Mark Zuckerberg is likely to get answers he can live with and that actually might be helpful.”

What Facebook wants to avoid, said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft strategist who is now an angel investor in tech start-ups, is what happened to Microsoft: The double whammy of government and legal entanglements and a stock price in the dumps had consequences for Microsoft’s ability to hold on to talent.

Facebook, he said, could see the same phenomenon if its growth slows and employees tire of oversight and constant attacks on the company’s reputation.

“The combination of a flat or declining stock price and having to spend lots of time on miserable legal issues instead of building product made a lot of people rethink how they wanted to spend their days,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “And Facebook employees may have a harder time gazing in an ethical mirror.”Friends said that after he left the organization, Mr. Buckel became involved in environmental causes, which he alluded to in his note as the reason he decided to end his life by self-immolation with fossil fuels.

“Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather,” he wrote in the email sent to The Times. “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”

In his note, which was received by The Times at 5:55 a.m., Mr. Buckel discussed the difficulty of improving the world even for those who make vigorous efforts to do so.

Privilege, he said, was derived from the suffering of others.

“Many who drive their own lives to help others often realize that they do not change what causes the need for their help,” Mr. Buckel wrote, adding that donating to organizations was not enough.

Noting that he was privileged with “good health to the final moment,” Mr. Buckel said he wanted his death to lead to increased action. “Honorable purpose in life invites honorable purpose in death,” he wrote.

The police said Mr. Buckel was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. in what they said was a suicide.

Susan Sommer, a former attorney for Lambda Legal who is now the general counsel for the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, said Mr. Buckel was “one of the architects of the freedom to marry and marriage equality movement.”

“He deserves tremendous thanks for recognizing this was in many ways at the heart of what it meant to be gay for many Americans and making it a priority,” she said. “I learned so much from him about the emotional center of what it means for a gay person not to be able to have all the protections for the person they love and that it’s worth fighting for.”

Lambda Legal credited Mr. Buckel for focusing the organization on the rights of lesbian, gay and transgender youth. One of the cases Mr. Buckel spearheaded, Nabozny v. Podlesny, was the first time a federal court ruled that schools have an obligation to prevent the bullying of gay students, said Camilla Taylor, acting legal director at Lambda Legal.

Mr. Buckel also guided Lambda Legal’s national work to allow gay people to marry. In another case he led, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples and their children were harmed because they were excluded from the rights granted via marriage. When Mr. Buckel suggested filing a lawsuit for gay marriage in Iowa in 2005, it was legal only in Massachusetts.

“It was considered a crazy thing to do because of the notion that Iowa would get to marriage equality before places like New York and New Jersey,” Ms. Taylor said.

Catherine Varous, a neighbor of Mr. Buckel’s, said he was very active in gardening, and together they worked on the Greenest Block in Brooklyn competition.

She said she often saw Mr. Buckel and his partner at the Park Slope Food Co-op and a farmer’s market. “He was the quieter of the two,” she said, referring to Mr. Buckel. “He was definitely more serious.”

Amy Orr, a kindergarten teacher who lives in the neighborhood, was out for her regular weekend jog at about 6:25 a.m. when she saw police officers standing over something that was smoldering.

She said she first “thought it was a pile of garbage because of the shopping cart” but then she saw the outline of a human body.

Runners and bicyclists continued to pass. But as more police officers and firefighters gathered, they all looked “dumbfounded,” Ms. Orr said. “Nobody could believe it.”

By 11 a.m., the authorities had removed Mr. Buckel’s body, leaving a blackened patch and a circular indentation around which parks officials placed two orange cones.

The grim scene stood in stark contrast to the rest of the park, which brimmed with activity. Several youth baseball games continued nearby and participants in PurpleStride, a walk dedicated to ending pancreatic cancer, strode along the bike path with runners and joggers.

The field where Mr. Buckel died would ordinarily be filled with activity, too. Warren Beishir, a graphic designer, said it was used for volleyball, soccer and barbecuing.

Mr. Beishir sat across from the field under a tree with his wife, Susan Stawicki, their 2-year-old daughter and their neighbors. They live across from the park and were awakened by sirens and flashing lights.

“How do you do that to yourself? It’s a terrible way to go, and I don’t want to think about it after today,” Mr. Beishir said.

“I hope they are at peace,” Ms. Stawicki said.“If we want change, it’s on us,” Ms. Nixon told the crowd after the party’s representatives endorsed her, with more than 90 percent of the vote. “We have to make it happen.”

The party’s decision came after a frantic set of developments on Friday. Two of Mr. Cuomo’s allies in the labor movement sought to stymie the Working Families Party by withdrawing from the organization, while the governor was said to have suggested withholding money from grass-roots community groups that have endorsed Ms. Nixon. Mr. Cuomo’s allies denied the governor had made this threat.

The public relations offensive continued on Saturday as several labor leaders and groups, including some who had been closely involved with the Working Families in the past, continued to criticize the party, in one case calling their leaders “lifestyle progressives” who had strayed from “their trade union roots.”

Speaking to the party faithful, the party’s state director, Bill Lipton, seemed to confirm that the loss of labor backing — including the departure on Friday of two powerful unions representing communication and building workers — had been traumatizing.

“This has been a rough week for the W.F.P.,” Mr. Lipton told the crowd on Saturday afternoon at the Albany Hilton.

Another leader, Karen Scharff, the party’s co-chairwoman, expressed “the greatest respect” for the two unions that had dropped out on Friday — Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and Communications Workers of America District 1.

“It saddens me to see them step away at this moment,” Ms. Scharff said, adding, “I’m confident that we will work together in the future.”

But it was also apparent that the tactics of Mr. Cuomo — who had a fraught relationship with the party, dating to his ultimately successful struggle in 2014 to get its nomination — and his allies had seemingly only hardened the consensus around Ms. Nixon.

“To endorse Cynthia Nixon is a very, very brave thing to do,” said Zephyr Teachout, who herself ran a spirited primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo in 2014, and is now working with Ms. Nixon’s campaign, adding that the governor’s actions to undermine the Working Families Party in recent days had been “horrifying.”

“Behind every bully,” she said, “there’s a coward.”

On Friday evening, after the union pullout, Mr. Cuomo’s campaign had said he would not seek the endorsement or the formal nomination of the Working Families Party, which will be finalized at its convention next month.

And after the party’s vote, Abbey Fashouer, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, defended the governor’s record — citing an increase in the minimum wage, a paid family leave program and billions in funding for education.

“The schism between the progressive unions who founded the W.F.P. and some of its member organizations is unfortunate,” Ms. Fashouer said. “But in that divide the governor stands with the unions who have left the W.F.P.”

A small cadre of party members had argued that the party should wait until their convention next month to endorse Ms. Nixon, with some warning that a Nixon candidacy, and a general election ballot line, could siphon votes from Mr. Cuomo in November and help a Republican candidate.

“We are deeply, deeply concerned about creating a spoiling situation,” said Beverly Brakeman, an official with U.A.W. Region 9A, which represents autoworkers and others in New England and New York City.

But those sentiments were drowned out by pro-Nixon supporters like Andrew Falk, a state committee member from Putnam County. “When the W.F.P. is under attack, what do we do?” Mr. Falk said. “Stand up, fight back.”

In early polls, Ms. Nixon — who began her campaign in mid-March — trails Mr. Cuomo by hefty margins among Democratic voters. Still, on Saturday, surrounded by fans, she seemed confident that she could compete.

She thanked the party for having her back, and said, “and just know I’ve always got yours.” She added, “Let’s win this thing.”Five months later, the Indonesian government has yet to implement the Constitutional Court ruling, although officials say they are working on it.

In a country where religion plays a large part in public life, followers of traditional beliefs, known generally as aliran kepercayaan, hope the ruling will finally end decades of unofficial discrimination that makes it difficult for them to get permits to open gathering places, obtain marriage licenses and get access to public services like health care and education. It also complicates efforts by those believers to get military, police or civil service jobs, or even burial plots in cemeteries.

There are hundreds of different forms of aliran kepercayaan spread across the vast Indonesian archipelago. In Java, the most populous island, it is often a mix of animist, Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic beliefs.

Forms of kepercayaan can include certain periodic religious observances, such as communal meals or acts that could be compared to Muslim men praying together on Fridays or Sunday Christian services. These may include ritual offerings to appease spirits, even though the practitioners could also be registered as Muslims, Catholics, Buddhists or one of the other recognized religions.

It is estimated that at least 20 million of Indonesia’s 260 million people practice local traditional beliefs, but the numbers could be much higher, according to analysts, as some are also followers of Islam, Christianity and other major religions.

Religion is so omnipresent in Indonesia that citizens are required to declare on their national ID cards which of the six approved religions they adhere to, though in some regions they are allowed to leave that section blank. However, doing so can invite discrimination and bureaucratic hassles, so many traditional believers simply state on their ID cards the religion that is dominant in the area where they live. In Java, it is likely to be Muslim, but in parts of the islands of Sumatra or Sulawesi, it could be Catholic or Protestant, while on Bali it would be Hindu.

But such workarounds should be unnecessary, some legal experts say.

“The court decision underlines that freedom of belief is a constitutional right, not a right that is given by the government,” said Bivitri Susanti, head of the Jakarta chapter of the Indonesian Association of Constitutional Law Lecturers.

“Second, it states that the right to belief in aliran kepercayaan, or faiths other than the six government-recognized religions, is inherent with the rights to religion as stated in Article 29 of the Indonesian Constitution,” she added.

But clouding that point of view is the fact that about 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, giving Islamic religious leaders outsize political clout. The Indonesia Ulema Council, the country’s top body of clerics, has been adamant, for example, that traditional beliefs should not be seen as on par with Islam.

“The Constitutional Court ruling was not considered carefully and hurt the feelings of the faithful, especially Indonesian Muslims, because the ruling has placed aliran kepercayaan as equals,” said Zainut Tauhid Sa’adi, the council’s vice chairman.

“The decision has legal consequences and an impact on our society,” he said.

Some hard-line Islamic groups want to go even further and change the Constitution to make Islam the official state religion.

However, key leaders within Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, support the court ruling.

Religion has always been a hot-button issue in Indonesia, which despite its Muslim majority has small but influential Christian, Hindu and Buddhist minorities. There have been hundreds of religiously motivated attacks on religious minorities in recent years, some resulting in death, as well as the forced closures of houses of worship and the passage of local bylaws viewed as discriminatory against religious minorities.

That tension has also reached the political realm: In May last year, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, the Christian governor of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, was sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy against Islam in a highly controversial case that his supporters say was concocted by radical Islamic groups bent on destroying his career.

As such, Indonesia’s Ministry of Home Affairs appears to be erring on the side of caution with the Constitutional Court’s November ruling.

Arief M. Edie, a ministry spokesman, said that the government respects and is implementing the ruling — but only by redesigning the national ID to accommodate the aliran kepercayaan as a choice in the section on religious status. It will not be recognized as the state’s seventh official religion.

“It’s acknowledged only as a culture, not a religion,” Mr. Arief said.

That narrow interpretation is not going over well with aliran kepercayaan followers, who say that local governments in Indonesia’s far-flung regions will continue to discriminate in the delivery of public services.

“The problem with any controversial ruling or policy lies in implementation down to the lowest level of government,” said Johannes Nugroho, an Indonesian political analyst and writer.

Mr. Nugroho, a former follower of both Christianity and kejawen, a traditional belief system, said he tried in vain to have Christianity removed from the religion section on his national identity card, preferring to have it left blank or, in an attempt to make a statement, changed to Hindu.

He said a clerk at his local government office flatly refused, then slyly suggested that if Mr. Nugroho would recite an Islamic creed to convert to Islam, he would put down Muslim on his identity card. Today it still identifies him as a Christian.

Still, traditional belief organizations say they are emboldened by the Constitutional Court ruling and see an opening to push for official acceptance.

“We’ll keep fighting for equality; we have equality, legally speaking, but in reality we don’t,” said Endang Retno Lastani, an elder with one Java-based group, whose national identity card is blank in the religious affiliation section.

“Our belief is the unity of God and people, just like other religions,” he said. “So what’s wrong with that?”“How’s that?” McKinnon asked.

“Because it will be me,” Bennett replied.

Soon after, Stiller walked on stage, introducing himself as Cohen, “attorney at law, and also sometimes not at law.” He went on to express disgust at having recently had his office and hotel raided by the F.B.I. in connection with multiple inquiries, including the Stormy Daniels affair, saying that the raids were “a complete violation of attorney-criminal privilege.”

Stiller acknowledged that the recent headlines had been problematic. (“I’m Donald Trump’s lawyer! I’ve got a whole hard drive that’s just labeled ‘Yikes!’”) But he remained loyal to the president, whom he called “the smartest, kindest, sexiest, least colluding man on this planet.”

Finally, Stiller was sent to an interrogation room to meet with De Niro, who immediately strapped him to a lie-detector machine. It took a couple of seconds for this part of the sketch to settle in with the audience. But eventually it hit: It was a recreation of a scene from the 2000 comedy “Meet the Parents,” in which Stiller and De Niro both starred, except that this time, De Niro was playing Mueller instead of an overprotective father.

The sketch even included lines lifted straight from the movie. There was Stiller saying, “You can milk anything with nipples.” And De Niro responding: “Really? I have nipples. Can you milk me, Mr. Cohen?”

The Return of John Mulaney

Mulaney made his highly anticipated hosting debut for “S.N.L.,” a show for which he was a writer for five seasons, creating among other things many “Weekend Update” sketches that have since become canon.

His opening monologue was a proper stand-up set that showcased his talent for dry, sardonic humor. He talked about aging: “I don’t like any new songs. Because every new song is about how tonight is the night.” He added: “I want to write songs for people in their 30s called ‘Tonight’s No Good. How About Wednesday?’”

On a related note, he expressed feeling left behind by modern technology. “The world is run by robots,” he said. “And sometimes they ask us if we’re a robot. Just because we’re trying to log on and look at our own stuff.”

He added: “You spend a lot of your day telling a robot you’re not a robot. Think about that for two minutes and tell me you don’t want to walk into the ocean.”

‘Weekend Update’ Jokes of the Week: Michael Cohen Edition

The hosts of “Weekend Update,” Michael Che and Colin Jost, went to town on Cohen’s headline-grabbing week. Here’s a sampling of the greatest hits:

“Authorities first became suspicious of Cohen when they found out he was the lawyer for Donald Trump.” — Michael Che “This does not look good for Trump. If being black has taught me anything, it’s that when the feds come kicking in your door, they’ve got something.” — M.C. “It’s amazing how we keep hearing ‘historic’ in reference to things that are happening during Trump’s administration, and none of them are positive. Historic has become a polite way of saying, ‘unbelievably terrible.’” — Colin Jost “These Trump stories are so random and insane, I feel like a contestant on ‘Chopped.’ ‘What the hell am I supposed to do with all these ingredients?’” — M.C. “President Trump responded to the claims in Comey’s memoir calling him a leaker and a liar, which coincidentally is also the name of the video the Russians have.” — C.J.

‘Weekend Update’ Deskside Bit of the Week

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Find a character McKinnon can’t play. This week, she portrayed the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has found herself in hot water recently after having taunted David Hogg, 17, one of the survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

McKinnon revealed some of her new sponsors, which included Carl’s Sr. and Malaysian Airlines: “Caught in a scandal and need an escape? Malaysian Airlines.”

Over all, she was defiant: “I will continue to defend the First Amendment. That’s my right to bully people without being bullied in return.”

Sketch of the Week: A Song of Angry Crustaceans

Why would anyone ever order lobster at a New York City diner? Or any seafood, for that matter?

And with that one simple premise, the “S.N.L.” writers produced one of the best sketches of the season. A diner patron played by Pete Davidson really wanted some seafood after winning a lawsuit against Bumble, a dating app, for giving him zero matches.

After some initial pushback, the server relented, and out came a defiant Kenan Thompson, dressed as a 40-year-old lobster in a tank, singing a spirited parody of “One Day More,” a song from the Broadway musical “Les Misérables.” (“Who am I? And why am I condemned to boil alive? When all that I have done is live my life?”)

But Davidson was defiant. He wanted his lobster. It was on the menu, after all. This meant more “Les Misérables,” including a parody of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” by a group of revolutionaries at the barricades. (“When the churning in your bowels matches the burning of his shell, you’ll know why lobsters in a diner never sell!”)

A New Sound for Jack White

We’re filing Jack White’s performances this week squarely under “What Was That?”

And we like Jack White.

His first song was “Over and Over and Over,” from his new album “Boarding House Reach.” It was a bit strange and disjointed — but this is Jack White, after all. By the end, it was a runaway freight train.—Marv Albert, radio and television voice of the Knicks for many years before moving on to NBC and now Turner Sports.

Start playing defense. It is rumored to be an essential part of basketball.

No matter what pieces they add, they need to play defense. They are a very bad defensive team. We see that now. My two rings (he says, holding up his two diamond-studded championship rings) are symbolic of defense, man. We play defense in spurts: 46 minutes, 45 minutes, you have to do it for 48 minutes to be victorious. And we have some good players.

—Clyde Frazier, a two-time N.B.A. champion with the Knicks. Yes, kids, it really did happen twice, long ago.

OK, Jeff Hornacek is out. But think really hard about that new coach, because there is probably more losing to come.

And after deciding who is their guy, what are the expectations for him? Because you can bring in another guy, your guy, but with that roster, and with Porzingis’s injury, nothing’s going to change for a while. So you’d better be sure the guy you choose is ready to deal with more losing — the way Brett Brown dealt with it in Philadelphia — and you are ready to not overreact when the fans and media start complaining about whoever is the coach, which is going to happen in New York. And then you have to figure out if you’re ready to give Porzingis—and his body does scare me, especially the legs—a max deal before he has come back healthy. You can’t have a plan until those questions are answered.

— Butch Beard, the point guard for the 1974-75 N.B.A. champion Warriors and a Knicks player, assistant coach and broadcaster in the 1970s and 1980s. He was also head coach of the New Jersey Nets for two seasons in the mid-1990s, so you get to hear him again if you keep reading.

It’s not just the coach, it’s gaps in the roster. Keep developing players in the G League.

A lot of people were saying get rid of Hornacek, but the Knicks don’t have a viable roster to compete, plain and simple. Their star player goes down or their second-best player goes down and the Knicks go in the toilet. It happened when Tim Hardaway Jr. went down and it happened when Porzingis went down. The team can’t function. So until you put the players on the court that are right for the coach, you’re not going to succeed.

One of the things the Knicks are doing which is positive is developing players in the G League. Developing players that can actually contribute or that become good trade assets — like Trey Burke — that’s something we weren’t doing before. I was campaigning for us to get Trey Burke on the Knicks because he’s a guard that can get in the lane and create.

— Leon Robinson, who attends a lot of games and has acted in films such as “Cool Runnings” and “Above the Rim.”

How the Nets Can Do Better Than 12th Place

Photo

The Nets already are kind of good. Until the fourth quarter.

They’ve done about as good a job as you can do starting out with nothing. Being left with nothing or starting out with nothing — however you want to look at it — they’ve found ways to come up with some talent after the franchise lost all of those first-round picks in that deal with Boston.

With a break here or there, they would have had 30 wins this season because they’ve lost so many heartbreaking games down the stretch in the fourth quarter or overtime. Win a couple of those and they’re at 30 wins, which is way more than people would have predicted at the beginning of the season.

The toughest thing, I think, in a situation like the Nets are in, is to stay the course and not deviate. Philadelphia was getting killed for a while there. Everybody was making fun of the Process. The Process looks pretty good right now, doesn’t it? You just had to wait through it.”

— Mike Fratello, a former N.B.A. head coach and current Turner Sports analyst, who also served as the longtime color analyst on Nets TV broadcasts.

There’s a wow factor coming, in a good way.

They need to put shooters around their point guard and build some depth. They’re really a young team. But those guys, I’m telling you it’s one of these types of teams that the minute they start to really make some hay, you’re going to turn around and go ‘Wow.’ They aren’t going to win the division next year, but they’re definitely making some strides internally. Sometimes you can’t see success because we are looking at wins and losses from the outside, but internally it’s almost like what Philadelphia did: you have to wait it out, pick up some top draft choices and coach them up. All of a sudden, you win 50 games.

— Nancy Lieberman, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and a coach for the Big3 league.

Keep flying under the radar, which has not really been a problem for this team. And build a better roster, which has been a problem for this team.

The best thing the Nets can do is continue to stay out of the limelight, which goes against the grain of what they’ve always been trying to do because their main problem in their entire existence has been being second-class citizens in their own market. They’ve never had a real fan base. The one thing you can’t say or write anymore is that the arena isn’t worth a damn — I love watching games at Barclays. Same thing with the franchise. Within a few years, if they have any luck building a team, it’ll probably be worth $2 billion. From where they were in Jersey, that’s real progress. So stay under the radar, let all the pressure be on the Knicks, and build your team.

— Butch Beard, a former N.B.A. player and broadcaster, was head coach of the New Jersey Nets for two seasons in the mid-1990s.

The Nets have a hopeful fan. He has had season tickets for four years. He really roots for the Knicks, but supporting the Nets ...

... is something to do and it’s fun. It’s just to be a part of something. And these season tickets are cheaper than with the Knicks. I will always love the Knicks. I am a New York basketball fan. The key is the Nets are trying to build on draft picks, but I think they need to try to do some trades. They have to be able to bring in a superstar. This is a beautiful facility, but a lot of these guys want nice practice facilities out in the country. This whole thing can turn around if we bring in a LeBron. You’ve got Jay-Z. We need a franchise player. I think the Nets will make the playoffs before the Knicks will ever make the playoffs.

— Victor Batine, 55, QueensThe effective tax rate — the average annual property tax, as a percentage of the average estimated market value of homes in each area — was about 1.2 percent, around the same as the year before, Attom Data reported. States with the highest effective property tax rates included New Jersey, Illinois, Vermont, Texas and New Hampshire, all of which were above 2 percent.

If you’ve received your formal tax bill, it may be too late to file an appeal — sometimes called an abatement request.

Typically, cities and towns first send out a notice of assessment, showing how your home is valued for tax purposes. Property owners then have a certain amount of time to challenge the assessment, though the period varies from state to state and even city to city. Some areas give a two-week window, while others may allow several months. Assessors are generally strict about filing dates, so if you file paperwork late, your appeal may not be heard.

“You really need to know those deadlines,” said Aaron Vansant, a partner with DonovanFingar, a Birmingham, Ala., law firm specializing in real estate matters.

Property tax experts suggest taking some basic steps to check the accuracy of your property’s valuation. If you added on to your house, your tax bill will probably be higher. But if the assessment shows that your home has four bathrooms, and you know it has two and a half, that’s an error that should be corrected. You may be able to have the mistake fixed with a simple phone call to the assessor’s office, depending on the department’s workload.

“It never hurts to pick up a phone and call,” said Risë E. Rosen, a property tax lawyer in Mineola, N.Y.

If you do file an appeal, you’ll need some data to back up your claim. That could be sales data for homes comparable to yours, provided by a real estate agent. Or, it could be a formal appraisal. The National Taxpayers Union offers tips on its website, including attending an appeals board hearing to get a feel for the process.

Mr. Vansant said he expected more homeowners to appeal property assessments next year because of recent changes in federal income tax law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law last year, capped the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000, so more homeowners may push back on higher property tax bills, he said.

Here are some questions and answers about property taxes:

How is my home valued for property tax purposes?

Tax bills are based on the market value of your home, or a percentage of its full market value, multiplied by a local tax rate — often known as a millage rate. (One “mill” equals $1 per $1,000 of assessed value.) Often, assessor departments provide examples online, to show how your town’s bills are calculated.

Do I get a discount for property taxes that are paid on my main home?

Many areas allow for a “homestead” exemption, which provides a discount or credit on your tax bill if the property is your main home. If you don’t see the exemption noted on your tax bill, check with your assessor to make sure you are getting the credit to which you are entitled. Also, some areas may offer a discount if you pay your taxes early, Mr. Vansant said.

How much will I pay for a property appraisal?

Fees vary, but an appraisal for a real estate tax appeal will probably cost $300 to $500, said Jim Murrett, president of the Appraisal Institute, a professional association of real estate appraisers.If it seems as though each time you log into Netflix there are a dozen new original series on offer, it might be because that’s essentially what’s happening. According to Variety, the company’s chief financial officer, David Wells, announced in February that Netflix was aiming to host around 700 original shows worldwide by the end of 2018. In the United States, some of these are shows produced by Netflix, and some are foreign shows for which Netflix has purchased the rights. Either way, it’s more television than any one person can consume.

In order to help you prioritize your queue, we’ll periodically sift through the latest original programming on Netflix and let you know which shows we think are worth watching. This inaugural roundup features crime thrillers, teen comedies, food shows and one of the craziest documentary series in recent memory.

Liv Lisa Fries in “Babylon Berlin.” Beta Film TV Show Babylon Berlin Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like “Babylon Berlin” has everything: Communists, fascists and flappers! Pornographers, cops and gangsters! Set during the Weimar Republic and created with the filmmaker Tom Tykwer (“Run Lola Run”), this hit German crime drama combines the decadence of “Cabaret” with the grit of a contemporary police procedural. At the center of its sprawling story are Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), a vice-squad detective scarred by his experiences in World War I, and Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries), a typist and sometime prostitute who wants desperately to join the all-male police force. For those who hate reading subtitles, there is a dubbed version available on Netflix. But it’s distractingly awkward, so consider giving the show a shot in its original language first.

Bhagwan Rajneesh in “Wild Wild Country.” Netflix TV Show Wild Wild Country Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like In the early 1980s, followers of the Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh built a community for themselves on a 63,000-acre swathe of Oregon ranchland. Tensions quickly flared between the commune, called Rajneeshpuram, and its new neighbor, the tiny city of Antelope. From one angle, the conflict appeared to pit xenophobic yokels against a vulnerable religious minority; from another, it appeared that a sex cult was terrorizing a quiet community of working-class retirees. And that was before things in Rajneeshpuram got really weird. The documentary series “Wild Wild Country” uses archival footage and startlingly frank interviews with the former leaders of the community and their adversaries in Antelope to raise big questions about spirituality, democracy and the ethics of self-defense.

Carey Mulligan and Nathaniel Martello-White in “Collateral.” Liam Daniel/Netflix TV Show Collateral Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like After appearing in one of last year’s best Netflix original films, “Mudbound,” Carey Mulligan returns to the streaming service with another stirring performance. “Collateral” casts her as Kip Glaspie, an ambitious detective inspector whose investigation into the murder of a pizza delivery man leads her to a far more complicated mystery. With lots of incisive commentary on immigration in post-Brexit Britain and a top-notch supporting cast that includes Jeany Spark, John Simm, Billie Piper and Nicola Walker, this mini-series isn’t just for thriller addicts. Bonus: You can — and will probably want to — watch the entire four-episode season in an afternoon.

A scene from “Ugly Delicious.” Netflix TV Show Ugly Delicious Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like If you’re a fan of Anthony Bourdain’s globe-trotting food-adventure shows, add this series to your queue. With episodes organized around dishes rather than destinations, “Ugly Delicious” sends David Chang, the chef and Momofuku restaurateur, to culinary capitals from Los Angeles to Copenhagen to Tokyo in order for him to sample the best incarnations of everyday meals like pizza and barbecue. Accompanying Chang is a boisterous, rotating cast of pals including Jimmy Kimmel and the “Walking Dead” actor Steven Yeun. In the sweetest episode, “Homecooking,” the host and his longtime collaborator, the food writer Peter Meehan, join Chang’s mother in her kitchen to prepare a Korean-American Thanksgiving feast.

Nicole Byer and Jacques Torres in “Nailed It!” Netflix TV Show Nailed It! Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Television can never get enough baking competitions, most of which follow the same basic recipe: Talented pastry chefs + high-concept creations + expert judges = sculptural desserts that are a feast for the eyes. “Nailed It!” swaps out the professional contestants in favor of hapless novices who try their damnedest to replicate elaborate wedding cakes and other decorative sweets. The result is Food Network meets Cake Wrecks, with a lot of heart. As host, the comedian Nicole Byer strikes the perfect balance between encouragement and ridicule, and the competitors’ self-aware humor ensures that the show never feels as if it’s taking cheap shots.

Regina King in “Seven Seconds.” JoJo Whilden/Netflix TV Show Seven Seconds Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like In this crime drama from Veena Sud, the creator of “The Killing,” a black teenager is struck by a car while riding his bike and is left for dead. But “Seven Seconds” isn’t a whodunit. We know from the beginning that the hit-and-run collision is an accident, that a white police officer named Peter Jablonski (Beau Knapp) is the culprit and that his colleagues help him cover it up. The question is: Will the burned-out prosecutor assigned to the case (Clare-Hope Ashitey) and her detective partner (Michael Mosley) figure out what happened? And if they do, will a jury punish four cops for what they did to a black teen? “American Crime” fans, take note: That show’s standout actress, Regina King, gives a similarly moving performance in this series as the victim’s mother.

A scene from “The End of the ____ing World.” Netflix TV Show The End of the ____ing World Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like British TV may be best known for Monty Python and costume dramas, but it is also home to some of the most daring teen programming in the English-speaking world. (See: “Skins,” “My Mad Fat Diary,” “Misfits.”) “The End of the ____ing World,” which comes to Netflix by way of Britain’s Channel 4, is an exceptionally dark, suspenseful comedy about two disturbed teens who run away together. But one of these road-trippers, James (Alex Lawther), is only feigning interest in his companion, Alyssa (Jessica Barden). What he really wants is to kick off his psycho-killer career by murdering her — or so he thinks.

Elijah Stevenson and Sydney Sweeney in “Everything Sucks!” Scott Patrick Green/Netflix TV Show Everything Sucks! Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like For a lighter teen comedy, try this charming show about outcasts living in the aptly named town of Boring, Ore., in the mid-1990s. Our heroes are the nerdy A.V. clique and their slightly older, slightly cooler peers in the drama club — two warring factions that unite to make an absolutely ridiculous movie. Odd-couple romances, betrayals, family conflicts, journeys of self-discovery and montages set to period-appropriate songs ensue, so it’s no wonder that “Everything Sucks!” has earned comparisons to “Freaks and Geeks.” While it doesn’t quite live up to that hype, the show is funny, sweet and sure to hit all the right nostalgia buttons for viewers in their 30s.

10 Great Movies Under 90 Minutes Long on NetflixWhen Kamasi Washington released “The Epic” in 2015, the country was being scarred on what felt like a daily basis by images of black people being killed at the hands of police. Mr. Washington’s triple album was a bursting, grandiose statement that, though recorded years earlier, seemed to speak directly to the needs of the moment: His scorching tenor saxophone and orchestral backing represented both the enormity of fury and the magnitude of a healer’s ambition. This week Mr. Washington announced a double-disc follow-up titled “Heaven and Earth.” Its first two singles bear a lot of the previous release’s markings: tons of horns, voices and strings; lengthy tunes, often in minor keys. But while “The Epic” delivered music of spiritual regeneration and self-affirmation, this new thing is a call to arms. On “Fists of Fury,” over a familiar Washington rhythm of Latin-tinged funk, the voices of Patrice Quinn and Dwight Trible declare, “We will no longer ask for justice. Instead, we will take our retribution.” GIOVANNI RUSSONELLOCAPE TOWN — To cut themselves free of the gender norms fed to them since birth, young South Africans aren’t using sharp edges but rather soft fabrics and turns of phrase. Their fashion and styling choices, as well as the words they use to describe their own bodies, challenge essentialism and the notion that any of our outward characteristics are fixed.

These young South Africans, most visible in urban centers like Cape Town, are playful in the ways they present themselves to the world. They eschew European designer labels manufactured for consumerism in favor of local designers, many of whom have caught the spirit of the moment.

That Cape Town, known as the “Mother City,” has become a front in the war on Western gender roles is somewhat fitting. It’s where the Dutch and, later, the British began their colonization of South Africa in earnest.Photo

Steve Schirripa said that landing the role as Bobby Baccalieri on “The Sopranos” was like “hitting the lottery — twice.” Over the past few years, the actor, who was born in Brooklyn and grew up on welfare, has gone from wiseguy to good guy as a regular on the popular CBS series “Blue Bloods,” in which he plays an investigator for a district attorney. After graduating from Brooklyn College with a teaching degree, he moved to Las Vegas and worked several jobs in the service industry. He was a bouncer at Paul Anka’s disco, Jubilation (which later became the Shark Club), and a mâitre d’ at the Riviera hotel before becoming the entertainment director there in 1986. Later, he owned his own talent agency in Las Vegas. Mr. Schirripa, 60, now lives in Manhattan with his wife, Laura, 55. They have two daughters, Bria, 26, and Ciara, 22.

GOOD MORNING, PANDORA I get up late on Sundays, about 9:30 or 10 a.m., and the first thing I do is put on Pandora Radio and listen to some Van Morrison, and then I make some coffee. My wife is usually out running, and since my daughters are often gone — one has moved out, and the other is away at college — there’s usually no one home to bug me.

Photo

CEREAL READER After two cups of coffee, I get on my computer and start reading newspaper columns and going on TV news websites, and I wait for my wife to bring me home copies of The New York Times, The Daily News and The New York Post. It’s the only day of the week I read the papers in print, and I enjoy reading them while I’m eating cereal.

FRESH AIR OR COURTSIDE After a shower, I go out around noon and walk for an hour on the West Side Highway path near Battery Park City, along the water. It’s absolutely beautiful. I pass the World Trade Center, then continue to TriBeCa and sometimes Chelsea. I will only miss my Sunday walk if the Knicks are playing at Madison Square Garden. I love basketball. I played the game at Brooklyn College, and the Knicks were always my favorite team. I used to buy $6 tickets through our student union and sit in the nosebleed seats, dreaming about being one of those guys in the fancy suits sitting courtside, and then came “The Sopranos,” and now I’m a regular at courtside. It’s like living a dream.

THE STORIES OF THEIR LIVES After my walk, I go to Barnes & Noble on Warren Street to look for biographies. Right now I’m reading Nick Nolte’s, and I just finished Neil Simon’s. I’m fascinated by people’s life journeys, how they got from one place in life to another.

HONK IF YOU’RE A FAN Around 3 p.m., my wife and I usually go to Harry’s Italian Pizza Bar on Murray Street for lunch. We walk there — I don’t own a car in the city because I hate driving — and along the way, some people who recognize me will say hello, and people driving past will honk their horns. It’s a nice acknowledgment from fellow New Yorkers, most of whom are great and very respectful.

Photo

MEATY ERRANDS Late afternoon or early evening, we go home, and I’ll read the papers again and go over my lines from a script I’ve been given for “Blue Bloods” or some other project. Then my wife and I will go down to Faicco’s Pork Store on Bleecker Street and pick up stuff to make antipasto salad like provolone, mozzarella, soppressata and roasted peppers.

LOYALTY My favorite place for dinner is Il Cortile on Mulberry Street. During my first two years on “The Sopranos,” I lived right above the restaurant, and the people there were always great to me.Photo

Some chefs meditate. Some do yoga. Others do shots. But when it comes to finding calm amid the hectic whirl of the professional kitchen, Ruth Rogers, the chef and owner of River Café in London, likes to stir risotto.

“Risotto is such a relaxing thing to make because of the slowness of it,” she said in a recent phone call. “It’s got a soothing rhythm that’s good when you’re anxious about something.”

And I was anxious about something, which is why I called. I was anxious about the nettle and taleggio risotto in the recently released “River Café London” cookbook (Knopf, 2018).

The book, a vibrantly designed celebration of the restaurant’s 30th anniversary, includes updated versions of recipes from the classic 1995 “River Café Cookbook,” along with new ones.

I would have probably passed right by the nettle risotto if it weren’t for the taleggio. Melty chunks of that funky, earthy cheese running all over the creamy rice had epic appeal, despite the nettles. I’ve had an aversion to those ever since I was stung as a kid trampling through the English countryside one summer vacation. That includes cooking them. Any recipe that begins with instructions to don thick rubber gloves for protection is just not very inviting.

Photo

So I asked Ms. Rogers: Could the risotto be made with a less ferocious green that’s also easier to find if you’re not running around British fields in your shorts?That fall, he left college and went to study dance at Juilliard. In addition to Graham and Limón, who were both on the faculty, he came into the orbit of the British ballet choreographer Antony Tudor, whom he still considers one of his strongest influences. Tudor taught his students that physical skill and technique, however necessary, were merely tools for revealing deeper meaning, an idea that resonated with the young Lubovitch, as did Tudor’s emphasis on visualizing the music as he danced. “It was about being the music,” Mr. Lubovitch said.

His eclectic and compressed training — he spent only two years at Juilliard — also meant that he didn’t have time to absorb the enmity that simmered between modern dance and ballet, two artistic camps that looked upon each other with suspicion. (To a certain extent, they still do.) “To me it was all dance,” he said. His own choreography embraces both the grace and line of ballet and the weight and purposefulness of modern dance. For him, there is no tension among abstraction, beauty and honest expression. (He has at times been criticized as sentimental, not that he minds, he said.) Nor has he shied away from making dance to “important” classical music, including compositions by Brahms, Schubert, Schumann and Mozart, composers often considered too monumental for dance.

The following are edited excerpts from a conversation looking back at his 50-year choreographic career.

You discovered dance as a freshman at the University of Iowa. How did it happen?

Marsha Thayer, who was a choreographer, dancer and teacher, came into my gymnastics warm-up one day and asked if there were any men there who would like to lift some women. That was how she put it. It was intriguing enough. She took me to my first dance concert, and it happened to be the Limón Dance Company. I remember everything they performed: “There Is a Time,” “The Emperor Jones” and “The Moor’s Pavane.”

Why has musical expression been so central to your idea of dance?

Music visualization sounds so corny now, but I do think it’s a bottom line of why people dance. Something about music filling our spirit and our having a physical reaction to it. But it’s spoken of less, and in certain circles it’s thought of as very old-fashioned.

Early on, in addition to dancing with Donald McKayle, Pearl Lang, John Butler and various ballet companies, you were a go-go dancer at a nightclub in Greenwich Village. What was that like?

Yes, Trude Heller’s. I wore white bell-bottoms and white go-go boots. In those days, go-go dancers stood on a ledge above the dance floor and demonstrated the latest dances. I was really good at it. Go-go dancing was where my spirit of dance came alive. I became more interested in choreographing because there was no other place I could dance where I felt that free.

Did you always think of yourself as a choreographer?

I made up my first dance when I was about 3. I first heard the word “choreography” as a child in a movie theater with my parents. It was a movie with Danny Kaye and he was doing a parody of Martha Graham, and the name of the dance parody was “Choreography.” I asked my father, “What does that word mean?” And he said, “That’s the guy who makes up the steps.”

What qualities do you value in movement?

My style of movement is very fluid. I always knew that one step had to come out of another, with a sense of inevitability. All of the movement comes out of itself and delivers the next idea.

You’ve said that “A Brahms Symphony” (1985) was a turning point for you. In what way?

Dance was exploding, and things were going in this much more conceptual direction. And I had to ask myself, was that really me or not? And I said, no, it isn’t me. So I went in the opposite direction and took this music by Brahms and did this very passionate, very sentimental, very physically expressive dance. It was a statement to myself and whoever was watching that this was my truth.

Some of your most well-received dances, like the duet from “Concerto Six Twenty-Two” (1986), “Men’s Stories” (2000) and “Little Rhapsodies” (2007), were made for men.

I like the way men dance, and I like women who dance like men. What I mean by that is that they have gravity and weight in their movement. So what I really like is a dancer who has gravity in both senses of the word: physical gravity and spiritual gravity.

You were also a pioneer in same-sex partnering. “Concerto Six Twenty-Two,” for example, contains a very moving pas de deux for two men. How did that come about?

We were at the beginnings of what was clearly going to be a worldwide crisis of AIDS. I had lost a close friend already. I thought that one of the emerging themes was friendship. People, very young people who didn’t expect to escort their friends to death, were helping people to die out of friendship. So I decided to do a dance that was basically about honoring friendship. The central duet was for two men, and the whole dance is about that. It resonated.

What is the idea behind your newest piece, “Something About Night”?

It’s composed of fragments of many dances I’ve done over the years, little moments in duets and trios. But mainly, my motivation was that I want to be quiet. I think I value quiet now. And in this dance, I’m seeking a quieting of the mind.

You’ve also taken up curating dance; you started the Chicago Dancing Festival in 2006, and now you’ve begun a new festival, NY Quadrille, at the Joyce. How do you see the current state of dance?

There are a lot of people making really, really good, deep dance right now in spite of the economic climate. On the ballet stage as well. We’ve seen a plateau for some time, but a plateau is just the place you know someone will use as a springboard. It’s inevitable. Art always moves forward.Photo

Without fail, every year early spring at the farmer’s market brings disappointment. We dutifully pack our tote bags with high hopes for rhubarb and strawberries, asparagus and tender field greens, only to find piles of last year’s cellared roots and apples — the same ones that were there months ago and will continue to be there for a few more weeks.

It’s in these weeks that citrus is a saving grace. A bright note under a cover of clouds — a big bowl full of grapefruit, Cara Cara oranges, lemons and limes — is enough to tide over even the most seasonally affected souls.

This lemon olive oil ice cream is a taste of sunshine, even as a chill often hangs in the air. It’s sweet and creamy from the dairy and eggs, tart from lemon zest and juice, and a little savory, from a glug of olive oil and a bit more salt than you might be used to in your ice cream.

Serve it with even more olive oil, flaky salt and a shower of finely grated lemon zest while you wait for the weather to turn. If you are somewhere a little sunnier, where the spring bounty has arrived, a few sliced strawberries wouldn’t be out of place on top.

(There is a small group of researchers who believe viruses may even have come here from outer space, an idea known as panspermia.)

Whatever the case, viruses are the most abundant entities on the planet by far. While Dr. Suttle’s team found hundreds of millions of viruses in a square meter, they counted tens of millions of bacteria in the same space.

Mostly thought of as infectious agents, viruses are much more than that. It’s hard to overstate the central role that viruses play in the world: They’re essential to everything from our immune system to our gut microbiome, to the ecosystems on land and sea, to climate regulation and the evolution of all species. Viruses contain a vast diverse array of unknown genes — and spread them to other species.

Last year, three experts called for a new initiative to better understand viral ecology, especially as the planet changes. “Viruses modulate the function and evolution of all living things,” wrote Matthew B. Sullivan of Ohio State, Joshua Weitz of Georgia Tech, and Steven W. Wilhelm of the University of Tennessee. “But to what extent remains a mystery.”

Do viruses even fit the definition of something alive? While they are top predators of the microbial world, they lack the ability to reproduce and so must take over the cell of a host — called an infection — and use its machinery to replicate. The virus injects its own DNA into the host; sometimes that new genes are useful to the host and become part of its genome.

Researchers recently identified an ancient virus that inserted its DNA into the genomes of four-limbed animals that were human ancestors. That snippet of genetic code, called ARC, is part of the nervous system of modern humans and plays a role in human consciousness — nerve communication, memory formation and higher-order thinking. Between 40 percent and 80 percent of the human genome may be linked to ancient viral invasions.

Viruses and their prey are also big players in the world’s ecosystems. Much research now is aimed at factoring their processes into our understanding of how the planet works.

“If you could weigh all the living material in the oceans, 95 percent of it is stuff is you can’t see, and they are responsible for supplying half the oxygen on the planet,” Dr. Suttle said.

In laboratory experiments, he has filtered viruses out of seawater but left their prey, bacteria. When that happens, plankton in the water stop growing. That’s because when preying viruses infect and take out one species of microbe — they are very specific predators — they liberate nutrients in them, such as nitrogen, that feed other species of bacteria. In the same way, an elk killed by a wolf becomes food for ravens, coyotes and other species. As plankton grow, they take in carbon dioxide and create oxygen.

One study estimated that viruses in the ocean cause a trillion trillion infections every second, destroying some 20 percent of all bacterial cells in the sea daily.

Viruses help keep ecosystems in balance by changing the composition of microbial communities. As toxic algae blooms spread in the ocean, for example, they are brought to heel by a virus that attacks the algae and causes it to explode and die, ending the outbreak in as little as a day.

While some viruses and other organisms have evolved together and have achieved a kind of balance, an invasive virus can cause rapid, widespread changes and even lead to extinction.

West Nile virus has changed the composition of bird communities in much of the United States, killing crows and favoring ravens, some researchers say. Multiple extinctions of birds in Hawaii are predicted as the mosquito-borne avipoxvirus spreads into mountain forests where it was once too cold for mosquitoes to live.

When species disappear, the changes can ripple through an ecosystem. A textbook example is a viral disease called rinderpest.

The Italian army brought a few cattle into North Africa, and in 1887 the virus took off across the continent, killing a broad range of cloven-hoofed animals from Eritrea to South Africa — in some cases wiping out 95 percent of the herds.

“It infected antelope, it infected wildebeest and other large grazers across the whole ecosystem,” said Peter Daszak, the president of Ecohealth Alliance, which is working on a global project to catalog viruses likely to pass from animals to humans.

“The impact was not just on the animals. But because they are primary grazers and they died off in huge numbers, vegetation was impacted, and it allowed trees to grow where they would have been grazed away,” he said.

“The large acacia trees on the plains of Africa are all the same age and were seedlings when rinderpest first came in and the wildlife died,” Dr. Daszak said. In other places, far less grazing created a hospitable habitat for the tsetse fly, which carries the parasites that cause sleeping sickness.

“These kinds of ecological changes can last for centuries or even millennia,” Dr. Daszak said.

Combined with drought, large numbers of people died from starvation as rinderpest spread. An explorer in 1891 estimated two-thirds of the Masai people, who depended on cattle, were killed.

“Almost instantaneously, rinderpest swept away the wealth of tropical Africa,” wrote John Reader in his book “Africa: A Biography of a Continent.”

With intensive vaccinations, rinderpest was completely wiped out, not only in Africa but globally in 2011.

The beneficial effects of viruses are much less known, especially among plants. “There are huge questions in wild systems about what viruses are doing there,” said Marilyn Roossinck, who studies viral ecology in plants at Pennsylvania State University. “We have never found deleterious effects from a virus in the wild.”

A grass found in the high-temperature soils of Yellowstone’s geothermal areas, for example, needs a fungus to grow in the extreme environment. In turn, the fungus needs a virus.

Tiny spots of virus on the plant that yields quinoa is also important for the plant’s survival. “Little spots of virus confer drought tolerance but don’t cause disease,” she said. “It changes the whole plant physiology.”

“Viruses aren’t our enemies,” Dr. Suttle said. “Certain nasty viruses can make you sick, but it’s important to recognize that viruses and other microbes out there are absolutely integral for the ecosystem.”The coastal province of Friesland, while part of the Netherlands, has its own language. “We don’t speak Dutch; we speak Frisian,” Ms. Poepjes said. “So that’s why we gained the title of cultural capital in 2018, and we wanted to highlight that.”

Working overnight last Friday, road crews painted about 490 feet of a newly paved, 124-mile stretch of the road with the strips.

Ms. Poepjes said music from “a popular part” of the regional anthem, “De Alde Friezen,” or “The Old Frisians,” from the 19th century, had been painted on. The project cost 80,000 euros, or about $99,000.

Signs told drivers, “You are approaching a singing road.” When drivers hit 60 kilometers per hour, about 38 m.p.h., the regional anthem rang loud and clear. And if drivers wandered onto the shoulder at a lower speed?

“If you go too slow, it’s the same thing like if you play a normal record: brr-brr-brr,” Ms. Poepjes said, imitating a slowed-down record.

And if a driver drove on the shoulder backward?

“You’d get the same thing if you play a Madonna record backward,” she said, laughing.

“It’s basically vinyl on the road,” Ms. Poepjes explained. “It’s like grooves on the record, but with literally grooves on the road. It’s a very basic concept.”

But soon, villagers began complaining that they could not sleep.

“The Frisian national anthem is fine, but not 24 hours a day,” Sijtze Jansma, who lives about 600 feet from the road, told the news website RTL. “I’m going nuts. You can’t sit outside and you can’t sleep at night.”

Residents are accustomed to noise because the village is home to an air base where fighter jets regularly take off and land. But another resident, Alie Tiemersma, told a local daily, The Leeuwarder Courant: “I would rather the planes than this. At least they stop at 5 p.m.”

View all New York Times newsletters.

Yet another, Margriet de Ruiter, told the newspaper that the noise from the road was “psychological torture.”

Ms. Poepjes said she had visited the village to hear complaints because officials wanted to be in sync with villagers on the project. What she heard, she said, was that “it’s working — but, please, not here.”

Basically, she said, “They hated it.”

Ms. Poepjes said residents had complained that a lot of drivers were deliberately veering onto the shoulder to start the anthem. “Enthusiastic young people were driving way too fast,” she said.

She added of the complaints: “I can completely relate. They could hear the anthem over and over when they were sitting in their garden; it has been wonderful weather.”

So, less than two days after the strips were laid down, province officials had them scraped off overnight Wednesday.

The Jelsum experiment is not the first of its type in the Netherlands. In 2014, the city of OSS installed glow-in-the-dark, “smart” highway lanes.

And the Netherlands isn’t the first country to make roads “sing” in an effort to improve safety. Denmark, Japan, South Korea and the United States also have musical roads.

Denmark claims credit for the first known musical road, known as the “Asphaltophone.” In Albuquerque, N.M., a section of Route 66 rumbles “America the Beautiful.” In Japan, rumble strips near Mount Fuji can be brought to life. In South Korea, musical grooves were installed in dangerous stretches to get drivers to pay attention, including one road that plays an off-key version of “Mary Had a Little Lamb.”

In Lancaster, Calif., however, a stretch of desert highway is woefully out of tune. It is supposed to play the “William Tell Overture” from Rossini’s opera when drivers hit 55 m.p.h.

The grooves in the road, however, were not installed at the right distance from each other, distorting the sound.

As for the Dutch experiment, Ms. Poepjes said officials had not totally given up.

“It has been fun, but now we’re in a cool-down period,” she said. “We’re not going to drop the idea completely. If we do it again, we will do it with a complete understanding of the neighborhood and make sure nobody is bothered by it.”

She added, “It just wasn’t a good idea in the end.”“Content had appeared that did not accord with core socialist values and was not a good guide for public opinion,” Mr. Zhang wrote. “Over the past few years, we put more effort and resources toward expanding the business, and did not take enough measures to supervise our platform.”

He added that Bytedance would expand its team for monitoring content to 10,000 people from 6,000 currently.

The company’s travails show how the government in Beijing has broadened its restrictions on what people see and say on the internet. Regulators are increasingly suppressing content that they deem pornographic or in poor taste, and not merely material that touches on politically sensitive topics such as regime change or personal freedoms.

The authorities are also scrambling to keep up as a new wave of Chinese apps, many of them built around short, spontaneously recorded video clips or live streams, helps people communicate and express themselves in new and hard-to-supervise ways.

Bytedance — which investors valued at more than $30 billion recently, putting it more in the financial league of Airbnb or SpaceX than of Buzzfeed or Vice — has assembled a confederation of these buzzy new apps. And it has made no secret of its desire to dominate phone screens across the rest of the world, too.

The company says it uses artificial intelligence technology to figure out what users like, then makes sure they are fed more and more of it. Read a few articles on the trade spat between the United States and China, and soon your Toutiao feed will be populated with news on international relations. Watch a bunch of stand-up comedy shows, and before long the app will suggest new comics who might appeal.

Bytedance has spent top dollar hiring engineers and software experts to fine-tune its recommendation technology.

“It’s like having a chef in your house who knows what kind of food you like,” said Xu Qinglu, a 22-year-old student and Toutiao user in Beijing.

“I think the app is not harmful,” she added. “The people who use it should be responsible for their own behavior.”

At an event in Beijing last month, Mr. Zhang said he hoped that more than half of the company’s users would come from outside China within the next three years. At the moment, he said, one in 10 of its users was overseas.

First, though, the company needs to continue thriving in China. Bytedance’s detractors say that salty, unwholesome material — the sort that has the Chinese government on edge these days — is exactly what the company’s apps have specialized in, and is a major reason for its popularity.

“Will a cleaned-up Toutiao still have an edge?” said Neil Arora, an American investor who previously worked in venture capital in Beijing.

“Toutiao’s strong team, refined algorithms and locked-in users may help it adapt,” said Mr. Arora, who is not a Bytedance shareholder. “However, the bigger danger is that all news apps may lose out, with users pulling away from sanitized news feeds for entertainment elsewhere.”

Hans Tung of GGV Capital, a venture firm that operates in both China and the United States and is a Bytedance shareholder, said he was confident the company would continue to add more types of material — not just the lowbrow kind — to its platforms. “The Toutiao we see today is not the Toutiao it will be five years from now,” he said.

“It’s better to go through this rodeo a few times,” Mr. Tung said of the latest rebuke from regulators. This way, he said, the company will be motivated to move more quickly in courting users who want higher-minded stuff.

Toutiao aside, three other popular news apps — including one run by Tencent, the giant Chinese conglomerate — were also taken down from stores this week.

Another fast-growing video app, Kuaishou, was removed last week alongside Huoshan, and also for featuring videos made by teenage mothers. In response, Kuaishou’s parent company said it would increase the size of its content-monitoring team to 5,000 from 2,000.

A posting from Kuaishou on one hiring website last week says the company is looking for people with bachelor’s degrees or higher. Candidates with “good political awareness” and “strong political sensitivity and discernment” are preferred. Being a member of the Communist Party or Communist Youth League is also a plus, the listing says.

Duanzi, Bytedance’s now-shuttered humor app, trafficked in dirty jokes, goofy comedy sketches and well-worn but persistent gender stereotypes. One post that appeared on the app before it was closed down declared that the way to know that a man won’t cheat on his wife is to place a beautiful woman before him — but the way to test a woman’s fidelity is to try seducing her with a lot of money.

Another post, unprintable in a family newspaper, was a ribald joke involving a seller of fried dough sticks, his wife and an irate customer.

Even Bytedance’s news app, Toutiao, featured plenty of edgy material that kept users coming back, sometimes reluctantly, for more. Xiao Lin, a 29-year-old programmer in Beijing, called the app “spiritual opium.”

“On a typical night, I would keep clicking on news items the app recommended to me while telling myself, ‘After this, I will sleep,’ ” Mr. Xiao said. “But I ended up reading more and more, for hours. I couldn’t stop.”

He deleted the app in January.On Saturday night, a small crowd filled a 120-seat theater in Fremont, Calif., to watch a movie unlike any other on the big screen, one that offers a fresh look at a tragic chapter in American history.

The nine-minute silent film, much of it previously thought to be lost, shows the ruins left by the earthquake that ravaged San Francisco 112 years ago, according to David Kiehn, a film historian who helped to identify and restore the footage, which he said was originally shot by the pioneering Miles Brothers film studio in San Francisco.In his tirade against the F.B.I., Mr. Trump mused about the possibility that he might soon fire Mr. Mueller. Last June, the president vented internally about wanting to fire Mr. Mueller, but was talked out of it.

“We’ll see what may happen,” Mr. Trump said Monday. “Many people have said you should fire him.”

The president once again railed against Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, for recusing himself in the Russia inquiry, and blasted the F.B.I. for failing to investigate Hillary Clinton, “where there are crimes.” He criticized Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing the Russia investigation, and called Mr. Mueller’s team “the most biased group of people,” who he said were mostly Democrats and some Republicans who had worked for President Barack Obama.

“That is really now on a whole new level of unfairness,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Stephen Ryan, confirmed the raids. “Today, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients,” Mr. Ryan said. “I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the office of special counsel, Robert Mueller.”

Mr. Sessions appointed the United States attorney for the Southern District, Geoffrey S. Berman, only in January. Mr. Berman is a former law partner of Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor and a supporter of Mr. Trump.

The payment to the pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, who is known as Stormy Daniels, is only one of many topics being investigated, according to a person briefed on the search. The F.B.I. also seized emails, tax documents and business records, the person said. Agents raided space Mr. Cohen uses in the Rockefeller Center office of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, as well as a room Mr. Cohen is staying in at the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue while his apartment is under renovation, the person said.

To obtain a search warrant, prosecutors must convince a federal judge that agents are likely to discover evidence of criminal activity.

The searches are a significant intrusion by prosecutors into the dealings of one of Mr. Trump’s closest confidants, and they pose a dilemma for Mr. Trump. He has dismissed Mr. Mueller’s investigation as a “witch hunt,” but these warrants were obtained by an unrelated group of prosecutors. The searches required prior consultation with senior members of Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, however, regarded the searches as an effort by Mr. Mueller to use New York’s prosecutors as his proxy, according to two people close to the men.

The searches open a new front for the Justice Department in its scrutiny of Mr. Trump and his associates: His longtime lawyer is being investigated in Manhattan; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is facing scrutiny by prosecutors in Brooklyn; his former campaign chairman is under indictment; his former national security adviser has pleaded guilty to lying; and a pair of former campaign aides are cooperating with Mr. Mueller. Mr. Mueller, meanwhile, wants to interview Mr. Trump about possible obstruction of justice.

It is not clear what Mr. Mueller saw that made him refer the matter to other prosecutors. But the searches show that Mr. Mueller does not believe that he has the authority to investigate all manner of allegations against everyone in Mr. Trump’s orbit. That is significant because lawyers for Paul Manafort, a campaign chairman for Mr. Trump who was indicted on money laundering, tax and foreign lobbying charges, have challenged Mr. Mueller’s mandate as overly broad.

Mr. Cohen is a longtime lawyer and fixer who, in a decade at Mr. Trump’s side, has served as a reliable attack dog against real or perceived threats to him. His activities have been scrutinized as part of Mr. Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Cohen recently paid $130,000 to Ms. Clifford, who said she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. Ms. Clifford has said she was paid before the 2016 election to buy her silence. She is challenging a nondisclosure agreement she signed barring her from discussing the matter.

The search is an aggressive move for the Justice Department, which normally relies on grand jury subpoenas to obtain records from people who are represented by lawyers and are cooperating with authorities. Search warrants are more often used in cases in which prosecutors do not trust people to preserve or turn over the records themselves. Justice Department rules require prosecutors to first consider less intrusive alternatives before seeking records from lawyers.

The searches of Mr. Cohen’s documents hark back to the pre-dawn F.B.I. raid of Mr. Manafort’s home. Those documents helped underpin Mr. Manafort’s indictment last fall.

Mr. Ryan said Mr. Cohen has cooperated with the authorities and turned over thousands of documents to congressional investigators looking into Russian election meddling.

The seized records include communications between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, which would most likely require a special team of agents to review because conversations between lawyers and clients are protected from scrutiny in most instances.

Though Mr. Mueller’s team did not initiate the search, if prosecutors in Manhattan uncover information related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, they can share that information with his team.

A Long Island native, Mr. Cohen began his career as a personal injury lawyer and taxi fleet manager. He joined the Trump Organization in 2006. He attracted attention in the Russia investigation after emails showed that a business associate of Mr. Trump, Felix Sater, pitched Mr. Cohen on a lucrative real estate deal in Russia.

The deal was supposed to be a Trump Tower in Moscow, and Mr. Sater boasted to Mr. Cohen that the tower would get Mr. Trump elected president. “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Mr. Sater wrote. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” But the emails obtained by The New York Times show no response from Mr. Cohen, who told congressional investigators that he regarded Mr. Sater’s talk as puffery.



It is not clear how significantly prosecutors view the payment to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Trump has denied knowing about it. And Mr. Cohen has said he paid Ms. Clifford out of his own money. Asked last week why Mr. Cohen made the payment, Mr. Trump replied: “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney, and you’ll have to ask Michael Cohen.”WASHINGTON — The United States and European allies launched airstrikes on Friday night against Syrian research, storage and military targets as President Trump sought to punish President Bashar al-Assad for a suspected chemical attack near Damascus last weekend that killed more than 40 people.

Britain and France joined the United States in the strikes in a coordinated operation that was intended to show Western resolve in the face of what the leaders of the three nations called persistent violations of international law. Mr. Trump characterized it as the beginning of a sustained effort to force Mr. Assad to stop using banned weapons, but only ordered a limited, one-night operation that hit three targets.

“These are not the actions of a man,” Mr. Trump said of last weekend’s suspected chemical attack in a televised address from the White House Diplomatic Room. “They are crimes of a monster instead.”

Shortly after the attack, the Syrian presidency posted on Twitter, “Honorable souls cannot be humiliated.”“They don’t delete anything, and that’s a general policy,” said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo, which offers internet privacy tools. He added that data was kept around to eventually help brands serve targeted ads.

Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: “When you delete something, we remove it so it’s not visible or accessible on Facebook.” She added: “You can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.”

Digging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here’s what I learned.

Facebook Retains More Data Than We Think

When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the “index” file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.

One surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone’s address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook’s messaging app, Messenger.

This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily — and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.

This felt unnecessary, though Facebook holds on to your phone book partly to keep it synchronized with your contacts list on Messenger and to help find people who newly sign up for the messaging service. I opted to turn off synchronizing and deleted all my phone book entries.

My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later — something I barely remember doing.

Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.

Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn’t try to purge this information.

But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of “Removed Friends,” a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the “Unfriend” button. Why should Facebook remember the people I’ve cut off from my life?

Facebook’s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature “On This Day,” which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I’d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.

The Ad Industry Has Eyes Everywhere

What Facebook retained about me isn’t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.

Lower down, there was a section titled “Advertisers with your contact info,” followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy — one was called “Microphone Check,” which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria’s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.

Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people’s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.

Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:

■ Buying information from a data provider like Acxiom, which has amassed one of the world’s largest commercial databases on consumers. Brands can buy different types of customer data sets from a provider, like contact information for people who belong to a certain demographic, and take that information to Facebook to serve targeted ads, said Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.

Last month, Facebook announced that it was limiting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom.

■ Using tracking technologies like web cookies and invisible pixels that load in your web browser to collect information about your browsing activities. There are many different trackers on the web, and Facebook offers 10 different trackers to help brands harvest your information, according to Ghostery, which offers privacy tools that block ads and trackers. The advertisers can take some pieces of data that they have collected with trackers and upload them into the Custom Audiences tool to serve ads to you on Facebook.

■ Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.

The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.

I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.

What About Google?

Let’s be clear: Facebook is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what information tech companies have collected on me.

Knowing this, I also downloaded copies of my Google data with a tool called Google Takeout. The data sets were exponentially larger than my Facebook data. For my personal email account alone, Google’s archive of my data measured eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. By comparison, my Facebook data was about 650 megabytes, the equivalent of about 160 hours of music.

Here was the biggest surprise in what Google collected on me: In a folder labeled Ads, Google kept a history of many news articles I had read, like a Newsweek story about Apple employees walking into glass walls and a New York Times story about the editor of our Modern Love column. I didn’t click on ads for either of these stories, but the search giant logged them because the sites had loaded ads served by Google.

In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.

Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.

Yet that offered little solace. Be warned: Once you see the vast amount of data that has been collected about you, you won’t be able to unsee it.All told I communicated with maybe a dozen men during that time in my life, and had sex with fewer than half. Others I texted or talked with, which sometimes felt nearly as intimate.

Before I met each man I would ask: “Why are you doing this?” I wanted assurance that all he desired was sex.

What surprised me was that these husbands weren’t looking to have more sex. They were looking to have any sex.

I met one man whose wife had implicitly consented to her husband having a lover because she was no longer interested in sex, at all. They both, to some degree, got what they needed without having to give up what they wanted. But the other husbands I met would have preferred to be having sex with their wives. For whatever reason, that wasn’t happening.

I know what it feels like to go off sex, and I know what it’s like to want more than my partner. It’s also a tall order to have sex with the same person for more years than our ancestors ever hoped to live. Then, at menopause, a woman’s hormones suddenly drop and her desire can wane.

At 49, I was just about there myself, and terrified of losing my desire for sex. Men don’t have this drastic change. So we have an imbalance, an elephant-size problem, so burdensome and shameful we can scarcely muster the strength to talk about it.

Maybe the reason some wives aren’t having sex with their husbands is because, as women age, we long for a different kind of sex. I know I did, which is what led me down this path of illicit encounters. After all, nearly as many women are initiating affairs as men.

If you read the work of Esther Perel, the author of the recently published book “State of Affairs,” you’ll learn that, for many wives, sex outside of marriage is their way of breaking free from being the responsible spouses and mothers they have to be at home. Married sex, for them, often feels obligatory. An affair is adventure.

Meanwhile, the husbands I spent time with would have been fine with obligatory sex. For them, adventure wasn’t the main reason for their adultery.

The first time I saw my favorite married man pick up his pint of beer, the sleeve of his well-tailored suit pulled back from his wrist to reveal a geometric kaleidoscope of tattoos. He was cleanshaven and well mannered with a little rebel yell underneath. The night I saw the full canvas of his tattoo masterpiece, we drank prosecco, listened to ’80s music and, yes, had sex. We also talked.

I asked him: “What if you said to your wife, ‘Look, I love you and the kids but I need sex in my life. Can I just have the occasional fling or a casual affair?’”

He sighed. “I don’t want to hurt her,” he said. “She’s been out of the work force for 10 years, raising our kids and trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. If I asked her that kind of question, it would kill her.”

“So you don’t want to hurt her, but you lie to her instead. Personally, I’d rather know.”

Well, maybe I would rather know. My own marriage had not broken up over an affair so I couldn’t easily put myself in her position.

“It’s not necessarily a lie if you don’t confess the truth,” he said. “It’s kinder to stay silent.”

“I’m just saying I couldn’t do that. I don’t want to be afraid of talking honestly about my sex life with the man I’m married to, and that includes being able to at least raise the subject of sex outside of marriage.”

“Good luck with that!” he said.

“We go into marriage assuming we’ll be monogamous,” I said, “but then we get restless. We don’t want to split up, but we need to feel more sexually alive. Why break up the family if we could just accept the occasional affair?”

He laughed. “How about we stop talking about it before this affair stops being fun?”

I never convinced any husband that he could be honest about what he was doing. But they were mostly good-natured about it, like a patient father responding to a child who keeps asking, “Why, why, why?”

Maybe I was being too pragmatic about issues that are loaded with guilt, resentment and fear. After all, it’s far easier to talk theoretically about marriage than to navigate it. But my attitude is that if my spouse were to need something I couldn’t give him, I wouldn’t keep him from getting it elsewhere, as long as he did so in a way that didn’t endanger our family.

I suppose I would hope his needs would involve fishing trips or beers with friends. But sex is basic. Physical intimacy with other human beings is essential to our health and well-being. So how do we deny such a need to the one we care about most? If our primary relationship nourishes and stabilizes us but lacks intimacy, we shouldn’t have to destroy our marriage to get that intimacy somewhere else. Should we?

I didn’t have a full-on affair with the tattooed husband. We slept together maybe four times over a few years. More often we talked on the phone. I never felt possessive, just curious and happy to be in his company.

After our second night together, though, I could tell this was about more than sex for him; he was desperate for affection. He said he wanted to be close to his wife but couldn’t because they were unable to get past their fundamental disconnect: lack of sex, which led to a lack of closeness, which made sex even less likely and then turned into resentment and blame.

We all go through phases of wanting it and not wanting it. I doubt most women avoid having sex with their husbands because they lack physical desire in general; we are simply more complex sexual animals. Which is why men can get an erection from a pill but there’s no way to medically induce arousal and desire in women.

I am not saying the answer is non-monogamy, which can be rife with risks and unintended entanglements. I believe the answer is honesty and dialogue, no matter how frightening. Lack of sex in marriage is common, and it shouldn’t lead to shame and silence. By the same token, an affair doesn’t have to lead to the end of a marriage. What if an affair — or, ideally, simply the urge to have one — can be the beginning of a necessary conversation about sex and intimacy?

What these husbands couldn’t do was have the difficult discussion with their wives that would force them to tackle the issues at the root of their cheating. They tried to convince me they were being kind by keeping their affairs secret. They seemed to have convinced themselves. But deception and lying are ultimately corrosive, not kind.

In the end, I had to wonder if what these men couldn’t face was something else altogether: hearing why their wives no longer wanted to have sex with them. It’s much easier, after all, to set up an account on Tinder.
